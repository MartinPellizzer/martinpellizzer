                <h1>Achillea occulta</h1>
<p>Achillea occulta, commonly known as the hidden yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, typical of the genus Achillea. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea occulta has small, basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a gray-green color and a hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, covered in fine hairs, and has a greenish-brown bark, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are yellowish-green, consisting of a central disk surrounded by ray florets, blooming in early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea occulta is primarily native to Greece.</p>
<p>It is found in specific regions of the country, particularly in the southern and central areas. This plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in open, sunny habitats. It is often associated with dry grasslands and scrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea occulta was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive white flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated gardens into natural areas, particularly in disturbed soils and open habitats. This plant is considered invasive in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution is now widespread across the western United States, especially in states like California and Oregon.</p>
<p>However, its presence is still limited compared to other more aggressive invasive species in the region.</p>
