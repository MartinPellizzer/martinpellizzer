<p>Acinos granatensis subsp.</p>
<p>aetnensis, commonly known as the Aetna thistle, is a perennial herb native to the volcanic soils of the eastern Mediterranean, particularly Sicily. It is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly foliage and spiny, spherical heads of yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, thriving in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its small, lanceolate leaves are covered in dense, glandular hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments.</p>
