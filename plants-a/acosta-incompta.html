                <h1>Acosta incompta</h1>
<p>Acosta incompta, commonly known as the Huayna Picchu orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the Andean regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, where it attaches itself to tree trunks and branches. Its leaves are strap-like and evergreen, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta incompta has leaves that are simple, alternate, and elliptical in shape, with a dark green color and a smooth texture, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid environment where the plant is commonly found.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta incompta is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes within the Andes. This plant thrives in temperate to cold climates and is often associated with montane ecosystems. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Acosta incompta is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the Andes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta incompta was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban areas where it thrives in full sun. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in many regions. It competes with native plants for resources, altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to control its spread and protect biodiversity.</p>
