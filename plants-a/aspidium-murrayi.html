<p>Aspidium murrayi, commonly known as the Murray's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically broad and leathery. Native to Australia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous sheath, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>The plant's spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
