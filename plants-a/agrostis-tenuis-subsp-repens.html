<p>Agrostis tenuis subsp.</p>
<p>repens, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, lawns, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies.</p>
<p>This species is often considered a weed in turfgrass settings but plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates.</p>
