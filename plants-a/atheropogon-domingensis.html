<p>Atheropogon domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican grass, is a species of grass native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in open, disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat.</p>
