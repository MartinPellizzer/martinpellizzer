                    <h1>Agave obducta</h1>
<p>Agave obducta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agave, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
