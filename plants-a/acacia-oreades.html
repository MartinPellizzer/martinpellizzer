                        <h1>Acacia oreades</h1>
<p>Acacia oreades, commonly known as the mountain acacia, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, feathery leaves that are adapted to arid and cold environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in harsh mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Acacia oreades is well-suited to rocky soils and can thrive in areas with low precipitation.</p>
