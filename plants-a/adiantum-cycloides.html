                <h1>Adiantum cycloides</h1>
<p>Adiantum cycloides, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant features a creeping rhizome that produces upright, spore-bearing fronds. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a unique, shield-like appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum cycloides thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum cycloides has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a delicate, lacey appearance, typically arranged in a bipinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually small, ranging from 10 to 20 centimeters in length, and have a pale green to bluish-green color. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a climbing or epiphytic manner.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant to its substrate, often growing on trees or rocks in humid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cycloides is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often associated with rich, organic soil. Its native range extends from Virginia through North Carolina and into Tennessee.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the understory vegetation in eastern deciduous forests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cycloides was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks. This plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily. It can outcompete native plants for resources, leading to ecological concerns.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
