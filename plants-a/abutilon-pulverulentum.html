                        <h1>Abutilon pulverulentum</h1>
<p>Abutilon pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters, featuring hairy, grayish-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Abutilon pulverulentum is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
