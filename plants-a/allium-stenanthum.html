<p>Allium stenanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are similar to garlic but are typically smaller and less aromatic. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Allium stenanthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
