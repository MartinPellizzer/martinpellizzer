                    <h1>Arceuthobium tibetense</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium tibetense, commonly known as the Tibetan dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses or other herbaceous species. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish stems and tiny, scale-like leaves. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and other parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
