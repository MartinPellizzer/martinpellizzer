                    <h1>Aspidium acrostichoides var. incisum</h1>
<p>Aspidium acrostichoides var. incisum, commonly known as the incised water fern, is a variant of the water fern family, belonging to the order Polypodiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with the pinnae often having a serrated or incised margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its distinct leaf morphology and its ecological role in maintaining soil stability in humid habitats.</p>
