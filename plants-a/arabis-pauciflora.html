<p>Arabis pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to its harsh, arid environment. Arabis pauciflora thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact growth form and ability to survive in extreme conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
