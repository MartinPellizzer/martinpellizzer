                        <h1>Acer chionophyllum</h1>
<p>Acer chionophyllum, commonly known as the snowflake maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are pale green on the upper surface and white on the lower surface, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils in cooler climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree in suitable regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer chionophyllum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia, including parts of China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in temperate forests and alpine meadows. This species is particularly adapted to cold climates and is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. Its natural range extends across the Himalayas and the northeastern regions of China.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often grows in isolated populations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer chionophyllum was mainly introduced to specific regions with cold climates and high altitudes, such as the Himalayas and other mountainous areas.</p>
<p>It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental value due to its white, silky foliage that resembles snow. It has been introduced to various botanical gardens and conservation sites to promote biodiversity and ecological research.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
