                    <h1>Acrostichum decurrens var. major</h1>
<p>Acrostichum decurrens var. major, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a large fern species native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, arching fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
