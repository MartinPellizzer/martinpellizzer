<p>Anthemis urosperma, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces a distinctive, branched seed structure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anthemis urosperma is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
