                <h1>Aconitum lycoctonum subsp. pyrenaicum</h1>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum subsp.</p>
<p>pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy blue to violet flowers.</p>
<p>The plant features palmate leaves with deeply lobed margins, typical of many members of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to the Pyrenees region.</p>
<p>The plant contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum subsp.</p>
<p>pyrenaicum has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, typically with five to seven divisions, and are usually dark green in color, with a rough texture. The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age.</p>
<p>The flowers are showy, blue to violet in color, and consist of five petals with a spurred lower petal, blooming in late summer to early autumn; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that develops from the flower, containing small, dark seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum subsp.</p>
<p>pyrenaicum is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically found in southern Portugal and western Spain. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in the mountainous regions of the Iberian Range.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes between 800 and 1,600 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum subsp.</p>
<p>pyrenaicum is a striking perennial plant known for its tall, spire-like flowers and dark green foliage. It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>This plant has a biennial growth cycle, though it is often treated as a short-lived perennial in gardens. It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires consistent moisture, though it should not be waterlogged. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its vigor, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs.</p>
<p>Companion planting with grasses or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and provide support for its tall stems.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum subsp.</p>
<p>pyrenaicum is a plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, which rely on its flowers for sustenance.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in natural habitats, supporting biodiversity by creating a complex ecosystem. Its deep roots help with erosion control by stabilizing soil in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological balance by offering shelter and habitat for small organisms in its surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum subsp.</p>
<p>pyrenaicum is a toxic plant native to the Pyrenees region, known for its striking blue or purple flowers. It has no known culinary uses due to its highly poisonous nature, containing dangerous alkaloids such as aconitine.</p>
<p>While it is not used in traditional medicine, its toxic properties have been studied for potential pharmaceutical applications. Culturally, it is often associated with mountainous landscapes and is appreciated for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents danger and beauty, frequently appearing in folklore and artistic works.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum subsp.</p>
<p>pyrenaicum has several popular cultivars that are favored in gardens for their striking blue or purple flowers, such as 'Blue Beauty' and 'Crimson King'. It is also commonly hybridized with other aconitum species to produce cultivars with enhanced hardiness and floral display.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit improved growth habits and color variations, making them more adaptable to different climates. Horticulturally, this subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in woodland or shaded garden settings.</p>
<p>Its cultivation contributes to the diversity of garden flora and the appreciation of alpine and subalpine plant species.</p>
