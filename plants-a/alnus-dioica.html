                    <h1>Alnus dioica</h1>
<p>Alnus dioica, commonly known as the European alder, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are either male or female, with male catkins hanging down and female catkins upright, a feature typical of dioecious species. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands.</p>
<p>Alnus dioica plays an important role in ecological systems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
