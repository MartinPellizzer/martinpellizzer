<p>Agropyron tilcarense, commonly known as the Armenian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to harsh environments, including cold and arid conditions, making it a resilient species.</p>
<p>Agropyron tilcarense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
