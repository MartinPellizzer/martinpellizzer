<p>Atriplex hillmanii, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often blue-gray leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically in the spring. Atriplex hillmanii is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
