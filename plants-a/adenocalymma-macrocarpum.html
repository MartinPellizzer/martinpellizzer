                <h1>Adenocalymma macrocarpum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. It produces large, woody capsules as its fruit, which contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma macrocarpum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma macrocarpum has leaves that are simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma macrocarpum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of the Northern Cape provinces. This plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It is commonly associated with coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma macrocarpum is well adapted to the semi-arid and Mediterranean climates of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma macrocarpum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste areas, and degraded forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is often found in the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded due to human activities and climate change.</p>
