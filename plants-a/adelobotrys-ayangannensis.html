                <h1>Adelobotrys ayangannensis</h1>
<p>Adelobotrys ayangannensis, commonly known as the Ayangannensis starling tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their ornamental and medicinal value. The tree is characterized by its dense foliage, small elliptical leaves, and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various bird and mammal species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation and botanical research.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys ayangannensis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a globose capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys ayangannensis is primarily native to Guyana.</p>
<p>This species is found in the dense tropical rainforests of the country. It thrives in the humid and warm climate typical of the region. The plant is often encountered in lowland areas with rich soil.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Guyana.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys ayangannensis was mainly introduced to the data as a rare and poorly understood species native to the humid forests of western Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations that allow it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Despite its limited distribution, it holds potential significance for botanical research and conservation efforts. The introduction of this species into the dataset aims to increase awareness and facilitate further study.</p>
<p>However, its exact range and population status remain largely undocumented.</p>
