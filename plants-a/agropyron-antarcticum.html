                    <h1>Agropyron antarcticum</h1>
<p>Agropyron antarcticum, commonly known as the Antarctic grass, is a hardy perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Antarctica and southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, icy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread and colonize barren landscapes effectively.</p>
<p>Agropyron antarcticum plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing minimal habitat for local wildlife in its extreme environment.</p>
