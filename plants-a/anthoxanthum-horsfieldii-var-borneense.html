<p>Anthoxanthum horsfieldii var. borneense, commonly known as the Bornean hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the tropical regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on moist, shaded soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale yellow to brownish flowers. It is adapted to humid, low-light environments and is often found in montane rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
