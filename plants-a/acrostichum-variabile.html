                <h1>Acrostichum variabile</h1>
<p>Acrostichum variabile, commonly known as the variable fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or near water bodies. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a soft, grass-like texture.</p>
<p>Acrostichum variabile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum variabile has leaves that are typically lanceolate or elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and can reach up to 30 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, usually greenish-white in color, blooming during the spring and summer months, and is pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum variabile is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of rivers and lakes. This plant thrives in humid environments with abundant moisture and partial to full sunlight. It is often associated with disturbed or aquatic habitats, such as swampy areas and floodplains.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes countries like Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum variabile was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and coastal areas. This plant is known for its tolerance to saltwater and can grow in brackish conditions. It has been reported as an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about ecological disruption in wetland ecosystems.</p>
