                <h1>Aeluropus lagopodioides</h1>
<p>Aeluropus lagopodioides, commonly known as the saltgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, grass-like foliage that thrives in saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize dunes and prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Aeluropus lagopodioides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal and desert ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus lagopodioides has leaves that are narrow, grass-like, and blade-shaped, typically arranged in a dense rosette, with a bluish-gray color due to a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and somewhat hairy, with a pale green color and a growth pattern that forms a low-growing, tufted plant. Its flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences with slender, three-angled bracts, and they are usually pale green to brown, blooming in early summer; they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor in sandy or saline soils.</p>
