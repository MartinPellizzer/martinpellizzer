                        <h1>Acantholimon cataonicum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon cataonicum, commonly known as the Cataonic thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features dense, spiny leaves and produces small, violet-colored flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to withstand arid conditions and grazing pressure.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon cataonicum is primarily native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey, Syria, and Lebanon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and limestone habitats, often in mountainous areas. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments with well-drained soils. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 500 to 2000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon cataonicum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically found in coastal or inland rocky habitats.</p>
<p>It is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed soils and can thrive in areas with low nutrient levels. It is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that its introduction may have ecological implications in non-native regions.</p>
