                    <h1>Armeria berlengensis var. villosa</h1>
<p>Armeria berlengensis var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy sea thrift, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Azores.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, hairy layer, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid coastal environment.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky or sandy habitats along the shoreline.</p>
