<p>Aristida tucumana, commonly known as the Tucum√°n grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Aristida tucumana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
