                            <h1>Araiostegia Decurrens</h1>
<p>Common groundsel, scientifically known as Araiostegia decurrens, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, often colonizing areas after fire or human activity. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Despite its common name, it is not closely related to true groundsel species but shares some similar growth habits. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
