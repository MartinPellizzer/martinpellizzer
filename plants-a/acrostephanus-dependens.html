                <h1>Acrostephanus dependens</h1>
<p>Acrostephanus dependens, commonly known as the hanging sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are typically succulent, adapted to conserve water. Acrostephanus dependens thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>It is a hardy species that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostephanus dependens has leaves that are opposite in arrangement, ovate in shape, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostephanus dependens is primarily native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape province.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in fynbos vegetation, which is a unique type of shrubland ecosystem. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast and in mountainous regions. It is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the area, characterized by wet winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>Acrostephanus dependens is often found in open areas such as coastal cliffs and rocky outcrops.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostephanus dependens was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa and Namibia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found along the shoreline and in dune environments. This species is well adapted to harsh, saline conditions and can withstand periods of drought. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several areas where it competes with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
