                    <h1>Archontophoenix alexandrae var. beatriceae</h1>
<p>Archontophoenix alexandrae var. beatriceae, commonly known as the Beatrice's palm, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Alexandra palm.</p>
<p>It is native to the island of Grande-Terre in the French Caribbean and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with a tendency to produce multiple stems from the base, forming a clumping structure. Its foliage is often a deep green, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that eventually develop into ornamental fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
