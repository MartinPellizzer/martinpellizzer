<p>Axonopus caulescens is a lesser-known grass species that thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, making it a popular choice for ornamental and ecological landscaping. This plant is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and wetlands. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it remains underappreciated in horticultural circles. Understanding its biology and habitat can help in its conservation and sustainable use.</p>
