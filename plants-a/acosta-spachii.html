                <h1>Acosta spachii</h1>
<p>Acosta spachii, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base.</p>
<p>Acosta spachii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta spachii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in poor, arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta spachii is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, including countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and mountainous areas, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. This plant is adapted to the cool and dry climate of the Andes, typically thriving at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. It is often associated with open habitats and is sometimes found in association with other Andean flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a regionally restricted species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta spachii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was primarily spread through human activities such as landscaping and horticultural trade. This plant has established itself in wetland and riparian habitats along riverbanks and coastal areas. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
