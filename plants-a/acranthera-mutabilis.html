                <h1>Acranthera mutabilis</h1>
<p>Acranthera mutabilis, commonly known as the variable acranthera, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its unique floral morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera mutabilis has leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits a trailing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera mutabilis is primarily native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Western Cape province, particularly in the mountainous regions. This species thrives in rocky outcrops and open grasslands. It is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>The plant is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its showy yellow flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera mutabilis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, quarries, and degraded grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. It is often associated with sandy or loamy soils and can tolerate some level of shade.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in agricultural and urban environments.</p>
