                <h1>Acer granatense var. nevadense</h1>
<p>Acer granatense var. nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red to orange foliage, which turns vibrant in the fall. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in catkins, appearing in early spring.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cooler climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer granatense var. nevadense has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a smooth margin and a vibrant green color during the growing season.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. It produces small, clustered flowers with yellow-green sepals and red stamens, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a paired samara with wings, dispersing by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer granatense var. nevadense is a rare variant of the granate maple native to the western United States, specifically found in Nevada and parts of California.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within the Great Basin and Mojave Desert regions. This plant thrives in arid to semi-arid environments, typically growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. It is commonly found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat fragmentation, Acer granatense var. nevadense is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer granatense var. nevadense is a hardy, deciduous tree known for its vibrant fall color and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seed propagation being the most common method. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter, making it suitable for temperate regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry spells but avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can enhance soil fertility and support its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer granatense var. nevadense is a hardy shrub that provides essential food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers, supporting local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in mixed-species vegetation, enhancing ecosystem stability. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, particularly on rocky slopes and in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and supporting microbial activity.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer granatense var. nevadense is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use due to its small size and specific habitat.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in traditional medicine, some local communities may use its bark or leaves for minor healing purposes. Its role in industrial applications is minimal, as it does not produce economically valuable timber or resins. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in regions where it grows, representing resilience and the beauty of mountain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary significance lies in ecological contributions rather than human utilization.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer granatense var. nevadense has several notable cultivars, including 'Crimson Knight' and 'Autumn Flame', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It also serves as a parent in various hybrids, such as with *Acer rubrum* and *Acer ginnala*, leading to ornamental varieties with enhanced hardiness and seasonal display. These hybrids often exhibit improved adaptability to different climates and soils, making them popular choices for landscaping. The species and its cultivars hold horticultural importance due to their aesthetic value and ability to thrive in a range of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer granatense var. nevadense contributes significantly to the diversity of maple trees in ornamental horticulture.</p>
