                <h1>Acioa bellayana</h1>
<p>Acioa bellayana, commonly known as the Bellayana acioa, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Acioa bellayana is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acioa bellayana has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface that turns reddish-brown underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with five white petals and prominent yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa bellayana is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude areas, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often associated with cloud forests and mountainous environments. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa bellayana was mainly introduced to new habitats in regions with similar ecological conditions to its native range, such as moist, shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>It has been observed spreading along forest edges and in disturbed areas, often outcompeting native vegetation. This distribution pattern suggests a preference for well-drained soils and moderate light levels. The plant's ability to thrive in these conditions has led to its establishment in several non-native regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics.</p>
