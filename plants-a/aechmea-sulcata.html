                <h1>Aechmea sulcata</h1>
<p>Aechmea sulcata, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The leaves are typically dark green with white or silver markings, and they are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces a flower spike that can reach several feet in height, bearing white or pink bracts.</p>
<p>Aechmea sulcata is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and ability to thrive in humid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea sulcata has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, fleshy, and often covered in a dense layer of white wool, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern around the central rosette, and they can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant has a short, thick stem that is usually hidden beneath the leaves, with a rough, fibrous texture. It produces striking inflorescences with red or orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, and they are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds.</p>
<p>The plant bears small, green berries that contain seeds dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
