                    <h1>Ammoides verticillata</h1>
<p>Ammoides verticillata, commonly known as the clustered ammoides, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring or early summer. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in poor soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Ammoides verticillata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties.</p>
