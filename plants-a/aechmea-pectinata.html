                <h1>Aechmea pectinata</h1>
<p>Aechmea pectinata, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which forms a central cup that collects water and nutrients. The plant's leaves are stiff and covered in a fine, hairy texture, contributing to its unique appearance. It produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that range from red to orange, often followed by the development of small, edible berries.</p>
<p>Aechmea pectinata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea pectinata has rosette-shaped leaves that are sword-like, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving them a fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged in a tight spiral around the central stem, with each leaf ranging from 30 to 60 cm in length and varying in color from dark green to bluish-green. The plant has a short, unbranched stem that is often hidden beneath the foliage, with a smooth, pale green bark. It produces tall, spikelike inflorescences with showy, violet or pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, relying on wind pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind, while the plant's roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
