                    <h1>Androcymbium gramineum var. saharae</h1>
<p>Androcymbium gramineum var. saharae, commonly known as the Saharan grass orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the arid regions of the Sahara Desert.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and exhibits unique adaptations to survive in extreme desert conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during brief periods of rainfall. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
