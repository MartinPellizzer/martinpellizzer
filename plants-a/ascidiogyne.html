                    <h1>Ascidiogyne</h1>
<p>Ascidiogyne, commonly known as the sea squirt, is a genus of marine invertebrates belonging to the class Ascidiacea.</p>
<p>These organisms are sessile, meaning they attach themselves to surfaces such as rocks or ship hulls. They possess a unique body structure with a gelatinous tunic that encases their internal organs. Ascidiogyne species are filter feeders, using a siphon system to draw in water and extract nutrients.</p>
<p>Their reproductive strategies vary, with some species reproducing sexually and others through budding.</p>
