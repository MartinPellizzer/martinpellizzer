<p>It has small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water requirements. Its fruit is a burr-like structure that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing.</p>
<p>Acaena deserticola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small wildlife.</p>
