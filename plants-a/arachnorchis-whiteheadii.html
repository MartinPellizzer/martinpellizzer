                    <h1>Arachnorchis whiteheadii</h1>
<p>Arachnorchis whiteheadii, commonly known as the Whitehead's spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>This terrestrial herbaceous plant produces delicate, spider-like flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland or rainforest habitats. The plant's unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
