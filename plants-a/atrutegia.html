                    <h1>Atrutegia</h1>
<p>Atrutegia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their heart-shaped leaves and showy, often purple or pink flowers that bloom in summer. Atrutegia species are typically annual or perennial herbs, often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. They have a robust root system and are known for their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which benefits soil fertility.</p>
<p>However, some species can become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain regions.</p>
