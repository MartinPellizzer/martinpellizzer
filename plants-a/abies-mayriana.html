                    <h1>Abies mayriana</h1>
<p>Abies mayriana, commonly known as the Mexican fir, is a coniferous tree native to the high elevations of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
