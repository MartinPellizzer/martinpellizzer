<p>Asplenium schizodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a compact, rosette-like form. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in low-light conditions. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat.</p>
<p>Asplenium schizodon is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in woodland ecosystems.</p>
