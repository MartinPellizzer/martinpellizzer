                <h1>Argythamnia grisea</h1>
<p>Argythamnia grisea, commonly known as the grey thornbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree with woody stems and spiny branches, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of grayish-white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Argythamnia grisea is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
