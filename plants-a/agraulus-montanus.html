<p>Agraulus montanus, commonly known as the mountain grass blue, is a small butterfly species belonging to the family Lycaenidae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe, including the Pyrenees and the Alps. The plant is not a plant itself but a butterfly, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss.</p>
