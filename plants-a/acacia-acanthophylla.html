                        <h1>Acacia acanthophylla</h1>
<p>Acacia acanthophylla, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are densely covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense cylindrical spikes, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acacia acanthophylla plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia acanthophylla is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the states of Queensland, New South Wales, and South Australia. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and scrublands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various native animals.</p>
<p>Its ability to withstand drought makes it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia acanthophylla was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a temperate to subtropical climate, typically found in regions with mild winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>It thrives in open landscapes such as grasslands, rocky outcrops, and disturbed sites where it can establish quickly. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and erosion control due to its extensive root system and rapid growth rate. It has been introduced to parts of Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, particularly in regions with similar climatic conditions.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential in some areas has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
