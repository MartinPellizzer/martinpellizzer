<p>Acacia acanthophylla, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are densely covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense cylindrical spikes, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acacia acanthophylla plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
