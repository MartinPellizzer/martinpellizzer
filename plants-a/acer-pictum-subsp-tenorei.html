                <h1>Acer pictum subsp. tenorei</h1>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>tenorei, commonly known as the Tenore's maple, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variant of the painted maple. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy, specifically the island of Sicily.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which features vibrant red and yellow hues during the autumn season. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant in woodland settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>tenorei has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a bright green color that turns yellow in autumn. The stem is smooth and slender, with a light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a upright growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in catkins, typically appearing in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed pod, which is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>tenorei is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in this area, making it one of the most endangered maple species.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, temperate forests with well-drained soils and moderate sunlight. This subspecies typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List, requiring urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>tenorei is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and compact growth habit. It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The tree has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and annual pruning to maintain shape are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with acid-loving plants like rhododendrons or heathers can enhance its growth in suitable soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>tenorei is a small, deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity.</p>
<p>The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and promoting the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>tenorei is a lesser-known maple species native to the Appalachian Mountains, primarily valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>In medicinal practices, it has been studied for potential anti-inflammatory properties, though further research is needed. Industrially, its wood is not commonly harvested due to its rarity and limited commercial value.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds significance in local botany and conservation efforts, symbolizing the unique flora of the region.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>tenorei has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Aureum' and 'Variegatum', which display striking yellow and variegated foliage. It is also known to hybridize with other maple species, producing unique variants that exhibit a range of leaf colors and growth habits.</p>
<p>These hybrids are often sought after by horticulturists for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions. The species and its cultivars hold significant horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Their visual diversity makes them a valuable addition to woodland gardens and landscape designs.</p>
