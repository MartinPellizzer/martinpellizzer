                        <h1>Acanthophyllum brevicalycale</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum brevicalycale, commonly known as the short-stemmed thorned grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale green or yellow flowers during the summer months, which are adapted for pollination by wind or short-range insects. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
