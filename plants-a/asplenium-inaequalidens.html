<p>Asplenium inaequalidens, commonly known as the unequal fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and colonize shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Asplenium inaequalidens is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in shaded, humid conditions.</p>
