                <h1>Acer pensylvanicum subsp. typicum</h1>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum subsp.</p>
<p>typicum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species.</p>
<p>The tree has opposite, palmate leaves that are typically 5-9 lobes, with a serrated margin. It produces small, red flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum subsp.</p>
<p>typicum has alternate, palmately compound leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a reddish or yellowish coloration in the fall, and a pointed shape; the leaves are arranged singly along the stem and are relatively small, usually less than 10 cm in length. The stem is slender and often grows in a shrub-like form, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, typically blooming in May or June, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind; the seeds are small and light, allowing them to travel considerable distances.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, acidic soils of its forest habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum subsp.</p>
<p>typicum is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States, primarily found in the Appalachian Mountains. Its current distribution includes parts of New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Virginia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, acidic soils within shaded to partially shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. This species typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>It is considered to be of conservation concern due to habitat loss and fragmentation, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum subsp.</p>
<p>typicum is a native deciduous tree known for its vibrant red autumn foliage and ecological value. It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>This species has a slow growth cycle, often taking several decades to reach maturity, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils with full to partial sun. Minimal fertilization is needed, and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in damp conditions, making it a good companion plant for shade-loving ferns and wildflowers.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum subsp.</p>
<p>typicum is a valuable native plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity. Its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and nourishment to local fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum subsp.</p>
<p>typicum is a species of maple native to eastern North America, known for its ecological and aesthetic value. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its sap can be tapped and processed similarly to other maple species for syrup production.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, various parts of the plant have been used by Indigenous peoples for their potential healing properties. Culturally, it is often symbolized as a representation of resilience and beauty in natural landscapes.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting local biodiversity and as a ornamental tree also contributes to its ecological and economic importance in forestry and landscaping.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum subsp.</p>
<p>typicum has several popular cultivars such as 'Summer Fire' and 'Coral Bells', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and compact growth. It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, producing varieties that exhibit enhanced hardiness and ornamental traits.</p>
<p>These hybrids often display more intense foliage colors and improved adaptability to different soil conditions. Horticulturally, the species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids contribute to the diversity of shade-tolerant plants in horticultural collections.</p>
