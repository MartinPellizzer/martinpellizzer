                    <h1>Arundo altissima</h1>
<p>Arundo altissima, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 6 meters in height, and its narrow, grass-like leaves with a fibrous texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense panicles during the summer months. It thrives in wetlands, riparian areas, and disturbed soils, often forming dense stands that can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth and invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
