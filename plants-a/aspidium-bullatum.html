<p>Aspidium bullatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it can absorb sufficient humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Aspidium bullatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions.</p>
