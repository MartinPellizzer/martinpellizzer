                    <h1>Aulomyrcia mathewsiana</h1>
<p>Aulomyrcia mathewsiana, commonly known as the Mathews's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the humid forests of eastern Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its evolutionary history and ecological role in its native ecosystem.</p>
