<p>Adhatoda gilliesii, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, featuring smooth, greyish bark and opposite leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their antispasmodic and respiratory benefits.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda gilliesii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are tubular, with five lobes, typically pink or purple in color, blooming from September to November, and are primarily pollinated by birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, often forming a dense network near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda gilliesii is a shrub native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, Namibia, and parts of Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is now also found in other regions due to horticultural introduction, including parts of Australia and the United States. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along riverbanks. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adhatoda gilliesii is considered to be of low conservation concern, though it is occasionally threatened by habitat degradation and overgrazing in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda gilliesii is a fast-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa, known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within two to three years under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new shoots.
