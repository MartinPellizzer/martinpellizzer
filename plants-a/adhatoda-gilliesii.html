                <h1>Adhatoda gilliesii</h1>
<p>Adhatoda gilliesii, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are usually a deep green color with a slightly hairy texture. Its most distinctive feature is the clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>Adhatoda gilliesii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda gilliesii has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and somewhat woody, with a rough, bark that is grey to brown in color and exhibits a fissured texture. The flowers are tubular, with five lobes, and are usually violet or purple in color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in the plant's anchorage and water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda gilliesii is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas, often growing along riverbanks and in moist forests. The plant thrives in warm climates with high rainfall and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of southern Asia, particularly in India and Sri Lanka, where it has been introduced.</p>
<p>Adhatoda gilliesii is known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda gilliesii was mainly introduced to areas where it has been cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant's introduction has often been unintentional, through seed dispersal via wind or water, or as a result of human activity such as trade or gardening. It has become naturalized in some regions, leading to concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its introduction, it is generally not considered invasive and is valued for its aesthetic qualities in gardens.</p>
