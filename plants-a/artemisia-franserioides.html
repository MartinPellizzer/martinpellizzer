                    <h1>Artemisia franserioides</h1>
<p>Artemisia franserioides, commonly known as the desert sagebrush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its strong, minty scent.</p>
<p>Artemisia franserioides is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
