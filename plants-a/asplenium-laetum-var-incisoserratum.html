<p>Asplenium laetum var. incisoserratum, commonly known as the serrated maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and serrated fronds that give it a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, glossy texture and a pale green to dark green coloration.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
