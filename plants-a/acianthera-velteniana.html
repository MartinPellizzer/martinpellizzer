                <h1>Acianthera velteniana</h1>
<p>Acianthera velteniana, commonly known as the Velten's orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a short, hairy stem and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive greenish-blue color and a yellow lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera velteniana has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a tubular shape and a striking violet-blue color, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera velteniana is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the Atlantic Forest region, which spans several states including Bahia, Esp√≠rito Santo, and Rio de Janeiro. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments within the dense tropical rainforests. It is commonly associated with rocky outcrops and disturbed areas within its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera velteniana was mainly introduced to areas with humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded environments, typically within forest understories or along riverbanks. This plant is commonly cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. Its introduction has been reported in several countries, including parts of South America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts.</p>
