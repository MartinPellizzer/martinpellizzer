                <h1>Adenocalymma cinereum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma cinereum, commonly known as the black-flowered rock heath.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically dark purple or black in color, which gives it its common name. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma cinereum is often found in coastal and inland fynbos vegetation, and it is adapted to withstand dry and nutrient-poor conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cinereum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cinereum is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, including the states of São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Espírito Santo. This plant typically grows in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this specific geographic region within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cinereum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with sandy or loamy soils that have been disturbed by grazing, agriculture, or urban development. This plant thrives in full sun and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>It is known for its ability to spread rapidly and tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions.</p>
