<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions. It has small, thorn-like stipules and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia delavayi var. kunmingensis has compound, bipinnate leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is dark brown in color, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are yellow, arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, with a structure consisting of a single stamen and a globular inflorescence, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a flattened, leathery pod containing small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are taproots with lateral branches, providing stability and efficient water absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia delavayi var. kunmingensis is a rare plant species native to China, specifically found in the Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations in the mountainous regions of southwest China. It thrives in dry, rocky environments with poor soil conditions. This variety typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,800 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
