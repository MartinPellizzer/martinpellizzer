                    <h1>Aspidium aculeatum var. microlobum</h1>
<p>Aspidium aculeatum var. microlobum, commonly known as the small-lobed water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. The plant features delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, contributing to its ability to colonize wet areas.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical characteristics make it well adapted to aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
