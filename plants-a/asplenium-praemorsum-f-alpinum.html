                    <h1>Asplenium praemorsum f. alpinum</h1>
<p>Asplenium praemorsum f. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine shield fern, is a rare and specialized fern species adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a rough texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded conditions, often found in mountainous regions across the northern hemisphere. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
