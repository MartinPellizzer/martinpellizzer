                    <h1>Atriplex limbata var. sexifida</h1>
<p>Atriplex limbata var. sexifida, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well-suited for reclaiming saline soils.</p>
<p>The variety sexifida is distinguished by its six-petaled flowers, which set it apart from other varieties of Atriplex limbata.</p>
