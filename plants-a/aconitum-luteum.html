                <h1>Aconitum luteum</h1>
<p>Aconitum luteum, commonly known as the yellow monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum luteum has leaves that are compound, typically with 5-9 lanceolate leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, and they are usually green with a slight yellowish hue.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hollow, and has a rough, hairy texture, with a pale green to reddish-brown bark. The flowers are blue to violet in color, clustered in racemes, and have a spurred petal, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a slit, and the seeds are small, winged, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, helping the plant store nutrients and survive harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum luteum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats, particularly in countries such as Austria, Switzerland, and parts of Germany. This plant thrives in rocky soils and open meadows at high altitudes. Its distribution includes areas of the Carpathian Mountains and the Alps.</p>
<p>It is often associated with moist, well-drained environments in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum luteum was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly in the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It has since become established in various regions, including parts of the United States and Canada. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is considered invasive in some areas where it spreads rapidly.</p>
