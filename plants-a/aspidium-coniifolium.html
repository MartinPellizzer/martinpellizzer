<p>Aspidium coniifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, pinnately compound leaves that are often dark green and have a rugged texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade.
