<p>Aster nubimontis, commonly known as the cloud mountain aster, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, star-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Aster nubimontis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small organisms.</p>
