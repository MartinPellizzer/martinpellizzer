                <h1>Achillea alpina var. discoidea</h1>
<p>Achillea alpina var. discoidea, commonly known as the Alpine Yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with finely divided, gray-green leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. discoidea has basal, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, with a hairy texture and a slightly rough margin, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, covered in a fine, whitish pubescence, and has a light green color, growing in a compact, low shrub form. Its flowers are flat-topped, composed of small, white to pale yellow ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in rocky or dry soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. discoidea is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Europe, including the Carpathian Mountains and the Alps, where it has been introduced. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, and well-drained soils, typically found in alpine meadows and grasslands. It grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The conservation status of this variant is currently listed as least concern, although its populations are threatened by habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. discoidea is a hardy perennial known for its attractive, fern-like foliage and delicate white flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the rhizomes in early spring or fall. This plant has a long growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and maintaining a compact form throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning dead flower heads after blooming helps maintain its appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. discoidea is a hardy perennial that provides nectar and pollen for pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering shelter and food sources. The plant acts as an erosion control species due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil in alpine and rocky environments. It also serves as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic compounds.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and promoting a healthy ecosystem in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. discoidea is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value in horticulture, often used in gardens for its attractive, daisy-like flowers.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, some traditional practices may incorporate it in small amounts for flavoring. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, though its use is limited compared to other members of the Asteraceae family. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators, playing a role in ecological conservation.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty, often appearing in botanical art and local folklore.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. discoidea has several popular cultivars, including 'Snow Drift' and 'Alpine Beauty,' which are prized for their delicate, white to pale yellow flower heads and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>These cultivars are often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to their hardiness and ornamental appeal. Hybrids of Achillea alpina var. discoidea have been developed to enhance flower color, bloom duration, and disease resistance, making them more adaptable to a range of garden conditions. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Overall, it remains a valuable addition to drought-tolerant and low-maintenance gardens.</p>
