                    <h1>Agrostis spica-venti var. coarctata</h1>
<p>Agrostis spica-venti var. coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a grass species characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often wind-dispersed, a feature that aligns with its common name, which translates to "wind spike grass.". It is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and adaptability, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in native plant gardens.</p>
