                <h1>Acroceras sparsum</h1>
<p>Acroceras sparsum, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, succulent appearance. The plant features small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to withstand arid conditions.</p>
<p>Acroceras sparsum thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland desert regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroceras sparsum has small, grass-like leaves that are narrow, linear, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and grows in a clumping manner. The flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, with tiny white or pale blue petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras sparsum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of the Free State province. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as grasslands and fynbos regions. It is commonly associated with coastal and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras sparsum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as part of European agricultural and ornamental plant introductions. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has a limited distribution compared to other introduced species.</p>
