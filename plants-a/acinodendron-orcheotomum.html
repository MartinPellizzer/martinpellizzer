                <h1>Acinodendron orcheotomum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron orcheotomum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, greenish flowers clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>Acinodendron orcheotomum is often used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its toxic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron orcheotomum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and measure approximately 5-8 cm in length with a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slight fibrous texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron orcheotomum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This plant thrives in humid, lowland forests and often grows near rivers or in swampy areas. It is known for its distinctive, palm-like appearance and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron orcheotomum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-altered landscapes, such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in many ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is commonly reported in ecological studies as a pioneer species in degraded habitats.</p>
