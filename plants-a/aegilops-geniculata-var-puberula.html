                    <h1>Aegilops geniculata var. puberula</h1>
<p>Aegilops geniculata var. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent wild wheat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and stems, which contribute to its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic contributions to modern wheat varieties.</p>
