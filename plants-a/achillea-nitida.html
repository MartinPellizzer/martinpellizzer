                <h1>Achillea nitida</h1>
<p>Achillea nitida, commonly known as silky yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with finely divided, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy white or pale yellow flowers in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, contributing to its silvery hue and giving it a soft, textured look.</p>
<p>Achillea nitida is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea nitida has narrow, linear leaves that are usually less than 2 cm in length, arranged in a basal rosette, and exhibit a grayish-blue color due to their dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, branching near the base, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite heads composed of many tiny florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, cylindrical achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>
