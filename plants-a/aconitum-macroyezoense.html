                <h1>Aconitum macroyezoense</h1>
<p>Aconitum macroyezoense, commonly known as the Yezo aconite, is a perennial herb native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that are often hairy.</p>
<p>Aconitum macroyezoense contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires caution when handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum macroyezoense has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are broad and green, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a dark brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom in late summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle containing small seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted for anchoring and nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum macroyezoense is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. This species is commonly found in forested areas and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum macroyezoense was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 2000s in Washington State. The plant was likely introduced through the horticultural trade as an ornamental species. It has since spread to neighboring states such as Oregon and British Columbia.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is now considered a potential threat to native plant communities.</p>
