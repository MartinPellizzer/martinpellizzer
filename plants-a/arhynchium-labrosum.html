<p>Arhynchium labrosum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed arhynchium, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically alternate in arrangement. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which are borne on short pedicels. Arhynchium labrosum is typically found in swampy or seasonally flooded areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
