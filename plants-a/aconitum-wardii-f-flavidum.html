                    <h1>Aconitum wardii f. flavidum</h1>
<p>Aconitum wardii f. flavidum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered aconite, is a variant of the aconite genus native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flowers, which contrast with its deep green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forested areas at high elevations. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated edges, and the plant produces showy, sparsely branched inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain potent alkaloids.</p>
