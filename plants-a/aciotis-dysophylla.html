                <h1>Aciotis dysophylla</h1>
<p>Aciotis dysophylla, commonly known as the Mexican dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and are followed by fluffy seed heads.</p>
<p>Aciotis dysophylla is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis dysophylla has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a straight, upright pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, displaying a pale yellow to cream color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions by forming a dense root system near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis dysophylla is primarily native to Central America, particularly in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed soils and open areas. This plant thrives in environments with moderate to high rainfall and is often associated with disturbed habitats like roadsides and agricultural fields. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is known for its small, yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of northern South America as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis dysophylla was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly. It has been used in some regions as a biocontrol agent against weeds.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive itself.</p>
