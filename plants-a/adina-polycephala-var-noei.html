                <h1>Adina polycephala var. noei</h1>
<p>Adina polycephala var. noei, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape and have a smooth upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, elliptical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforest areas.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and furniture-making.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina polycephala var. noei has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom during the summer months; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody drupe that contains a single seed, which is dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina polycephala var. noei is a rare plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions of Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to fragmented areas within these countries. It thrives in humid, shaded understory environments of lowland and montane forests. This species typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, it is classified as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adina polycephala var. noei is a tropical shrub known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity in 2â€“3 years under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new shoots. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adina polycephala var. noei is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility and benefiting surrounding plants.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adina polycephala var. noei is a plant with various uses and applications across different domains.</p>
