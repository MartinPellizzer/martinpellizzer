<p>Arnoldia fraxinifolia, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows to a height of 20 to 40 meters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for urban landscapes and reforestation efforts.</p>
