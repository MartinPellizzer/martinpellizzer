                <h1>Actaea racemosa</h1>
<p>Actaea racemosa, commonly known as black cohosh, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that bear clusters of small, white to greenish flowers. The plant produces dark red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it important to handle with care. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>Black cohosh is often found in moist woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea racemosa has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are doubly serrated, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring 5â€“15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a single central axis. The plant produces greenish-white flowers in dense, drooping racemes during late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects such as beetles and flies.</p>
<p>The fruit is a cluster of red berries that disperse seeds through animal consumption, and the roots are thick, fibrous, and tuberous, often used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea racemosa is primarily native to Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Ontario, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as woodlands, swamps, and stream banks. This plant is commonly found in the eastern and central United States. It is known for its striking white flowers and red berries, which attract various pollinators and wildlife.</p>
<p>Actaea racemosa plays an important ecological role in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea racemosa was mainly introduced to Germany as a ornamental plant due to its attractive, cone-shaped flowers and its presence in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, wooded areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade. The plant has become naturalized in certain regions of Germany, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to outcompete native plant species.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, Actaea racemosa requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in local ecosystems.</p>
