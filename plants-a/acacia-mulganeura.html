                        <h1>Acacia mulganeura</h1>
<p>Acacia mulganeura, commonly known as the malleefowl acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its grey-green, narrow, and often twisted leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Acacia mulganeura plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
