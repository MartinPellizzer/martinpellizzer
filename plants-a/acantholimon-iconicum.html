                        <h1>Acantholimon iconicum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon iconicum, commonly known as the iconic saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in the summer months. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
