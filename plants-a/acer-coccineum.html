                <h1>Acer coccineum</h1>
<p>Acer coccineum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red leaves in the fall, which contribute to its ornamental value. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn brilliant shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>The red maple is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer coccineum has palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged oppositely on the stem, and reaching up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright red in autumn, providing striking visual contrast against the green foliage in spring and summer. The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. The plant produces small, clustered yellow-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and have no showy petals.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing the species to spread efficiently in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer coccineum is a species of maple native to the eastern United States, specifically found in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia, though it is now quite rare. It thrives in moist, acidic soils in forested areas, often growing in partial shade. This species is typically found at elevations between 600 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Acer coccineum is listed as endangered in several states, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer coccineum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant red foliage, commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving plants like ferns or hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer coccineum is a small, deciduous tree known for its vibrant red foliage and ecological significance.</p>
<p>It provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. The tree attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers. It acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity.</p>
<p>Additionally, its extensive root system helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil in forested areas.</p>
