                        <h1>Acer coccineum</h1>
<p>Acer coccineum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, palmate leaves that turn brilliant shades of red, orange, and yellow during autumn. It produces small, red samaras that disperse its seeds in the wind.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more rugged with age.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer coccineum is primarily native to the eastern United States, including parts of the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. This species thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with mixed hardwood forests. Its range extends from New York and Pennsylvania southward to Georgia and westward to Kentucky and Tennessee.</p>
<p>It is also known to occur in parts of southeastern Canada.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer coccineum was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as an ornamental tree due to its striking red foliage.</p>
<p>It has been planted in gardens and parks across the region for its aesthetic value. However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native species. The plant's rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, its ecological impact has led to increased monitoring and management efforts.</p>
