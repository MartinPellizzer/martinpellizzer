                <h1>Acer coccineum</h1>
<p>Acer coccineum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, palmate leaves that turn brilliant shades of red, orange, and yellow during autumn. It produces small, red samaras that disperse its seeds in the wind.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more rugged with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer coccineum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with yellow-green petals and red sepals, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two wings, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer coccineum is a species of maple native to the eastern United States, primarily found in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the southeastern and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests and along stream banks. This species typically grows at elevations between 300 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Acer coccineum is considered a species of concern in some areas due to habitat loss and limited distribution, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer coccineum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and delicate flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acer coccineum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer coccineum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its showy red flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and promoting the growth of other native species. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer coccineum contributes to ecological benefits by improving air quality and offering habitat for a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer coccineum is a small deciduous tree known for its vibrant red flowers and is primarily valued for its ornamental use in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its flowers can be occasionally used in teas or as a colorful garnish. In traditional medicine, it has been used in some cultures for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. The tree also holds cultural significance in certain regions, where it is symbolized as a marker of seasonal change or a symbol of resilience.</p>
<p>Economically, it contributes to the horticultural industry by providing aesthetic value and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer coccineum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Orangeola' and 'Sibiricum', which are known for their striking red foliage and compact growth habit. Hybrid forms have been developed to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and fall color. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in a range of conditions and their aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>They are widely cultivated in gardens and parks for their vibrant seasonal displays.</p>
