<p>Arachnorchis robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's spider orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin, hair-like filaments that resemble the legs of a spider. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and produces small, greenish-white flowers during the cooler months. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
