                <h1>Adicea nutans</h1>
<p>Adicea nutans, commonly known as the nodding adicea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive nodding inflorescences. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth surface and dark green color. Its flowers are typically blue or violet, with two lips, and are arranged in spikes.</p>
<p>Adicea nutans thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea nutans has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth upper surface and a slightly hairy underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length and typically a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to pale brown color, and it grows upright with a somewhat trailing habit. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with tubular corollas and five lobes, displaying a pale yellow to white color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in the plant's ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea nutans is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa, particularly found in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of tropical regions in Asia and the Pacific, where it has been introduced as an ornamental species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands, often near streams or in humid undergrowth. Adicea nutans is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat faces threats from deforestation and habitat degradation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adicea nutans is a hardy, flowering plant known for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing established clumps, with seed propagation requiring stratification for optimal germination. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within one growing season and blooming in early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. Common pests include aphids and slugs, while diseases like powdery mildew can occur in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
