                <h1>Adicea nutans</h1>
<p>Adicea nutans, commonly known as the nodding adicea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that droop downward, giving it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture.</p>
<p>Adicea nutans typically grows in woodland areas and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea nutans has leaves that are opposite in arrangement, ovate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture, measuring approximately 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing upright with some branching. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in panicles, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea nutans is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with humid lowland areas and is well-adapted to the warm, humid climate of its native range. It is also occasionally found in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Adicea nutans plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea nutans was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant spreads rapidly through seed dispersal by birds and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
