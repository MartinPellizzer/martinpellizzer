                <h1>Adina stipulosa</h1>
<p>Adina stipulosa, commonly known as the African snowball, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina stipulosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, typically 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanging throughout the plant's life. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, with a simple structure that relies on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina stipulosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland forests and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. It is often associated with secondary growth areas and can be found in both natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Adina stipulosa is an important component of the flora in these regions, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina stipulosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a temperate to subtropical climate. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often associated with secondary successional communities. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate various soil types contribute to its spread in invaded areas.</p>
<p>Adina stipulosa is considered an invasive species in many parts of the world due to its competitive nature and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
