                <h1>Acer micranthum</h1>
<p>Acer micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Its fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer micranthum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, typically 5-10 cm long, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip; the leaves are dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer micranthum is a small, deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States, particularly in parts of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has been largely restricted due to habitat loss, with the species now found primarily in protected areas and botanical gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in rich, hardwood forests and along stream banks. Acer micranthum typically grows at elevations ranging from 50 to 300 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species and is listed on the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer micranthum is a small, deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle of Acer micranthum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>
