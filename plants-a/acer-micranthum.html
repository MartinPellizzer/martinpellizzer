                <h1>Acer micranthum</h1>
<p>Acer micranthum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are typically palmately lobed, with a smooth margin. Its flowers are small and clustered, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The tree produces samaras, which are winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer micranthum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, typically measuring 3-6 inches in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn yellow in the fall. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, with yellowish-green petals and a clustered arrangement, relying on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer micranthum is a small deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States, specifically found in parts of Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has been largely restricted due to habitat loss, with populations now primarily found in protected areas and conservation reserves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in forested environments, often in the understory of mixed hardwood forests. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 50 to 300 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acer micranthum is considered endangered due to its limited range and habitat degradation, prompting conservation efforts to protect and restore its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer micranthum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for germination. The growth cycle involves active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer micranthum is a small, deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity. Its dense foliage helps prevent soil erosion, particularly in moist, woodland environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by adding organic matter to the soil as it decomposes.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer micranthum is a species of maple native to the eastern United States, known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports local ecosystems, though it has limited economic value.</p>
<p>Culturally, it serves as a symbol of native flora and is appreciated for its ecological role in forest habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer micranthum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Coral Beauty' and 'Red Sunset,' which are known for their striking fall color and compact growth habit. Hybrids of Acer micranthum are often created to enhance traits such as disease resistance, flowering time, and color intensity. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability to various climates and their ability to add visual interest to gardens.</p>
<p>They are widely used in landscaping and public parks for their aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
