                    <h1>Amauropelta noveboracensis</h1>
<p>Amauropelta noveboracensis, commonly known as the New York shield fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
