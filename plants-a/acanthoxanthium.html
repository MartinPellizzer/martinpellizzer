<p>Acanthoxanthium, commonly known as the spiny yellow grass, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, often spiny stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of grasses. Acanthoxanthium is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists studying desert flora.</p>
