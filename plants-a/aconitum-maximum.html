                <h1>Aconitum maximum</h1>
<p>Aconitum maximum, commonly known as the giant monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces large, showy blue or purple flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, which is typical of the genus Aconitum. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply cut lobes that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum maximum is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and contains toxic alkaloids, making it both a beautiful and dangerous plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum maximum has leaves that are large, heart-shaped, and deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is tall, upright, and covered with a smooth, greyish-brown bark, growing in a straight, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurs, blooming in summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum maximum is primarily native to Alaska, Aleutian Is., Kamchatka, and Kuril Is.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in the cold, temperate climates of these regions. It is commonly found in mountainous areas and along the coastal regions of these territories. The species is adapted to the rugged and often harsh environments of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum maximum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its striking purple flowers and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species for resources. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes have raised ecological concerns.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its spread and protect local biodiversity.</p>
