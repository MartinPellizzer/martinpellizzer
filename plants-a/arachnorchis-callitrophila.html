                    <h1>Arachnorchis callitrophila</h1>
<p>Arachnorchis callitrophila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive terrestrial orchid native to the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white flowers that resemble spider-like structures, hence its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and is often found on decaying tree stumps or logs. It has a short, stocky stem and produces a single, showy flower that blooms for only a short period.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
