<p>Armeria alpina subsp.</p>
<p>fontqueri, commonly known as the alpine thrift, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with basal leaves that are linear and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens.</p>
