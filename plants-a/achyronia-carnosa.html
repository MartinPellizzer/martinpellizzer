                <h1>Achyronia carnosa</h1>
<p>Achyronia carnosa, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically purple or blue in color, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Achyronia carnosa is also known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful if ingested.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia carnosa has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are a deep green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a slightly hairy texture. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanging throughout the plant's life. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia carnosa is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This plant is commonly found in the Everglades and other similar habitats in the region. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the availability of moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia carnosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and abandoned lots.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common sight in urban and rural environments. This plant is often found in the eastern and central United States, where it has adapted to various climates and soil conditions. Its ability to spread through seeds and vegetative growth has contributed to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
