                    <h1>Arenaria ovalifolia</h1>
<p>Arenaria ovalifolia, commonly known as the ovalleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions across Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for rock gardens and other xerophytic landscapes.</p>
