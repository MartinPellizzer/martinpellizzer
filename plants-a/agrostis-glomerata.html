                    <h1>Agrostis glomerata</h1>
<p>Agrostis glomerata, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and streambanks. The plant has slender,丛生 (tufted) growth habit with narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>Agrostis glomerata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
