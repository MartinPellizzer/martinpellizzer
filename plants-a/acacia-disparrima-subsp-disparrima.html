<p>Acacia disparrima subsp.</p>
<p>disparrima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are typically narrow and linear.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in reclamation projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
