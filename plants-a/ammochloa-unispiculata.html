<p>Ammochloa unispiculata, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources and survive prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>Ammochloa unispiculata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
