                <h1>Acer longipedicellatum</h1>
<p>Acer longipedicellatum, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer longipedicellatum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated leaflets that are oval in shape, medium in size, and have a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during late spring, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed pod that disperses by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to its native habitat in moist, temperate forests.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer longipedicellatum is a rare flowering tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, specifically in provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, where it grows in cool, moist environments. It typically thrives in mixed forests at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Acer longipedicellatum is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer longipedicellatum is a unique maple species known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for better germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer longipedicellatum is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers. Its dense foliage acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. The tree also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a wide range of insect and animal life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer longipedicellatum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use due to its small, bitter fruits.</p>
<p>However, it holds potential for medicinal applications, as some species of maple are known to contain compounds with anti-inflammatory properties. In terms of industrial and economic value, it may contribute to local ecosystems and biodiversity, supporting wildlife and potentially being used in ornamental horticulture. Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in regions where it is native, representing resilience or natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, while not widely utilized, Acer longipedicellatum could play a role in ecological conservation and future botanical research.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer longipedicellatum has several popular cultivars such as 'Aconitifolium' and 'Crispum', which are valued for their striking foliage colors and unique leaf shapes.</p>
<p>It is also known to hybridize with other maple species, producing ornamental varieties that exhibit enhanced hardiness and visual appeal. These hybrids often display more vibrant autumn colors and improved adaptability to different climates. Due to its ornamental value, Acer longipedicellatum plays a significant role in horticultural landscapes, particularly in gardens and public spaces.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids contribute to the diversity of maple trees used in both residential and commercial landscaping.</p>
