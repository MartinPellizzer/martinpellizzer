                <h1>Acer longipedicellatum</h1>
<p>Acer longipedicellatum, commonly known as the long-pedicellate maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring palmate leaves with five to seven lobes that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by samaras with elongated petioles. It typically grows to a height of 10–15 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer longipedicellatum has alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside; the leaves are arranged singly along the stems.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in upright clusters, with greenish-yellow petals and stamens; they bloom in early spring and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind; the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer longipedicellatum is a rare species of maple native to the mountainous regions of southern China, specifically in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>It is currently found in limited areas within its native range, with scattered populations in high-altitude forests. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in temperate forests. It is typically found at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer longipedicellatum is listed as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer longipedicellatum is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its delicate, lace-like foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years, making it ideal for smaller gardens or containers.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining, slightly acidic soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to shape the plant and remove any dead or diseased branches.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions, and it pairs well with companion plants like ferns or heathers for a shaded, woodland look.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer longipedicellatum is a small, ornamental tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. Its dense foliage acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing biodiversity. The tree also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological benefits of the landscape by supporting a variety of insect and bird life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer longipedicellatum is a rare and ornamental maple species primarily valued for its unique, elongated floral structures, making it a popular choice in botanical gardens and horticultural displays.</p>
<p>While it is not traditionally used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in herbal teas, though this is not widespread. The wood of Acer longipedicellatum is not commonly used in industrial or economic contexts due to its limited availability and slow growth. Culturally, it holds significance in botanical research and conservation efforts, symbolizing biodiversity and the importance of preserving rare plant species.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological studies also highlights its potential in understanding plant adaptation and evolution in specific habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer longipedicellatum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Orange Emperor,' which are known for their striking foliage colors. The species is often hybridized with other maples to create plants with enhanced traits such as improved cold hardiness or more vibrant fall color. These hybrids are of significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in landscaping.</p>
<p>They are widely used in gardens and parks for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in diverse climates.</p>
