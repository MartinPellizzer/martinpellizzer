<p>Arceuthobium microcarpum subsp.</p>
<p>microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is typically found parasitizing the roots of various grasses and sedges.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique mechanism for seed dispersal, where the seeds are propelled by a catapult-like action. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in disturbed or nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant populations and soil dynamics.</p>
