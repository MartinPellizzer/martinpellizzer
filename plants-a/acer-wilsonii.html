<p>Acer wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble those of maple trees. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree.</p>
