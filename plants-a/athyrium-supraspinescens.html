                    <h1>Athyrium supraspinescens</h1>
<p>Athyrium supraspinescens, commonly known as the broad-leaf mountain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive silvery underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, allowing it to thrive in humid, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
