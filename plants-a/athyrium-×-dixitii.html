                    <h1>Athyrium × dixitii</h1>
<p>Athyrium × dixitii, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium capillus-veneris.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a slight reddish hue on the underside. The plant produces no spores, as it is a sterile hybrid, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded gardens. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its foliage adds a lush, textured appearance to the landscape, though it does not produce true flowers or seeds.</p>
