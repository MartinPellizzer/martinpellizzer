                    <h1>Aeridostachya unifolia</h1>
<p>Aeridostachya unifolia, commonly known as the single-flowered grass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces a single, elongated inflorescence bearing small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, typical of many grass species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range.</p>
