                        <h1>Abutilon globiflorum</h1>
<p>Abutilon globiflorum, commonly known as the globe flower or woolly abutilon, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and clusters of small, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are borne in dense inflorescences, which give it a unique and ornamental appearance.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon globiflorum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in lowland areas with well-drained soils. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats such as riverbanks, roadsides, and open woodlands. It is known for its showy, globe-shaped flower clusters that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including the Caribbean and southern United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon globiflorum was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was initially brought there for ornamental purposes due to its attractive, globe-shaped flowers. However, it has since spread rapidly and is now considered a significant threat to native ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation for resources.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
