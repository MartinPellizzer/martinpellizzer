                    <h1>Arceuthobium domingense</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium domingense, commonly known as the Dominican dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on coniferous hosts for survival.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and obtains nutrients through specialized roots that attach to the host tree. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
