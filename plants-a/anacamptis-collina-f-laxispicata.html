                    <h1>Anacamptis collina f. laxispicata</h1>
<p>Anacamptis collina f. laxispicata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in damp, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its flowers are arranged in a loose spike and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
