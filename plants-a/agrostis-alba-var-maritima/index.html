                            <h1>Agrostis Alba Var. Maritima</h1>
<p>Saltgrass, scientifically known as Agrostis alba var. maritima, is a resilient plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is commonly found in sandy soils along shorelines and in dunes where salt spray and wind are prevalent. This grass species plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Its ability to withstand harsh conditions makes it an important part of coastal ecosystems. Despite its hardy nature, Saltgrass is often overlooked for its ecological significance.</p>
