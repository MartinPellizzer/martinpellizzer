                <h1>Aegiphila quinduensis</h1>
<p>Aegiphila quinduensis, commonly known as the Quindu sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the high-altitude conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila quinduensis has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that has a rugged texture. It produces small, clustered flowers with pinkish-white petals, blooming during the dry season, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after drying.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its rocky, nutrient-poor habitat.</p>
