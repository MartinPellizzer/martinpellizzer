<p>Alsine stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, erect stems covered in small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Alsine stricta is often found in sandy or disturbed soils, thriving in dry, open habitats.</p>
