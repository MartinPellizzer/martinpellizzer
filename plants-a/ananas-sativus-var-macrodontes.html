                    <h1>Ananas sativus var. macrodontes</h1>
<p>Ananas sativus var. macrodontes, commonly known as the wild pineapple, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of long, spiky leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a spiky, edible fruit that is smaller and less sweet than the cultivated pineapple. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential for hybridization, it is often cultivated for both horticultural and commercial purposes.</p>
