<p>Atriplex elachophylla, commonly known as silverleaf shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically small, oval-shaped, and have a leathery texture, adapted for water conservation.</p>
<p>Atriplex elachophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
