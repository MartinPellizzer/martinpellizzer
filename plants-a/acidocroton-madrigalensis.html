                <h1>Acidocroton madrigalensis</h1>
<p>Acidocroton madrigalensis, commonly known as the Madrigal croton, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often strikingly ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, colorful leaves that display a range of hues, including red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidocroton madrigalensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, pale gray bark that becomes rougher with age, growing upright with some branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton madrigalensis is primarily native to the southeastern region of Mexico.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of this area. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the understory of forests. The plant is commonly associated with limestone soils and is often found in montane cloud forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton madrigalensis was mainly introduced to the wet tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, making it a common sight in the understory of rainforests. This plant is often found growing along riverbanks and in secondary forests, where it adapts well to disturbed habitats. Its introduction has been linked to both natural dispersal and human activities such as deforestation and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>Despite its adaptability, it remains relatively localized and is not widely cultivated outside its native range.</p>
