                <h1>Achras hoshinoi</h1>
<p>Achras hoshinoi, commonly known as the Japanese achiote, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae, and is characterized by its succulent, palm-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its growth habit makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor plant collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras hoshinoi has large, palmate leaves that are typically 30-50 cm in diameter, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a panicle inflorescence, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spherical, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, dispersed primarily by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant and helping it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras hoshinoi is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests and along riverbanks where the climate is warm and humid. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary growth areas. It is known for its ornamental value, especially due to its striking white flowers.</p>
<p>However, its natural range is relatively limited compared to other species in the Acharis genus.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras hoshinoi was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive, palm-like appearance and large, waxy leaves. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
