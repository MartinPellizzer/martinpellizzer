                <h1>Acronia carrenoi</h1>
<p>Acronia carrenoi, commonly known as the Carreno's acronia, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in the spring. Acronia carrenoi is often found in moist, tropical environments, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia carrenoi has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, covered in a smooth, light brown bark, and exhibits a creeping growth pattern along the ground. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia carrenoi is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil, particularly in the state of Santa Catarina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the Atlantic coast, where it thrives in the humid and temperate climate. This plant is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of the region, including high salt content in the soil and strong coastal winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia carrenoi was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often due to human activities such as land clearing and urban development.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate moisture and partial shade, making it a common sight in disturbed landscapes. This plant has spread across various regions, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities in invaded areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, Acronia carrenoi is considered an invasive species in many of the regions where it has been introduced.</p>
