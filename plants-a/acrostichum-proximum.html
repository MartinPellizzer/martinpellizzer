                <h1>Acrostichum proximum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum proximum, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its small, compact growth habit. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous stem and fertile spore-bearing structures on the underside of its fronds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum proximum has long, narrow leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure around 30â€“50 cm in length with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>Its stems are upright, with a smooth, slightly ridged bark that is a light brown color, and they grow in dense, clumping formations. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively across moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum proximum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in swampy or wetland habitats, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. This plant is also present in some Caribbean islands, including the Bahamas and parts of the Lesser Antilles. It is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and can be found in brackish water environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to areas with high humidity and consistent rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum proximum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant is known for its ability to tolerate saline and brackish conditions. It has been observed spreading along tidal zones and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to changes in local ecosystems due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
