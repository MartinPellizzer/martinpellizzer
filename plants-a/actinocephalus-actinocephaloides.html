<p>Actinocephalus actinocephaloides, commonly known as the African star grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, star-like inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in a dense, spherical cluster. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in natural habitats.</p>
