<p>Argemone sexvalvis, commonly known as the prickly poppy, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, glandular stems and leaves, which are covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with five petals, followed by capsule fruits that split open to release seeds. Its seeds are encased in a hard, waxy coating, which helps them survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Argemone sexvalvis is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions.</p>
