                        <h1>Absinthium glaciale</h1>
<p>Absinthium glaciale, commonly known as snow absinth, is a perennial plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its flowering stems are often used in herbal medicine for their purported diuretic and digestive properties.</p>
<p>Absinthium glaciale thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
