                    <h1>Andryala humilis</h1>
<p>Andryala humilis, commonly known as the lesser arnica, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in compact clusters. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its roots are fibrous and used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Andryala humilis thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
