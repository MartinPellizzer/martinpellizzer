The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Asyneuma salignum is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
