                <h1>Acinos acuminatus</h1>
<p>Acinos acuminatus, commonly known as the sharpleaf acino, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of small tubular and ray flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, open habitats such as grasslands and slopes, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, giving it the common name "sharpleaf," and it produces small, yellowish flowers in the summer.</p>
<p>Acinos acuminatus is known for its resilience to drought and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos acuminatus has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and often branching, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are small, composite-like clusters (capitula) consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming in early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene, dispersed by wind due to its small, lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption in dry environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos acuminatus is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, including grasslands, open woodlands, and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed sites and can be found in areas with mild winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>Acinos acuminatus is an important part of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos acuminatus was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and open woodlands. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments with well-drained soils. It is often seen as an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily.</p>
<p>However, it also plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
