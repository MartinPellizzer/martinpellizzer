                    <h1>Acnida cannabina var. lanceolata</h1>
<p>Acnida cannabina var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hemp nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its resemblance to cannabis, it is sometimes mistaken for the marijuana plant, though it contains negligible levels of THC.</p>
