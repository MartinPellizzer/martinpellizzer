                <h1>Achyranthes totonaca</h1>
<p>Achyranthes totonaca, commonly known as Mexican knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common weed in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes totonaca has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with ovate to elliptical leaflets arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green, with a smooth surface and vary in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length. The stem is erect, herbaceous, and has a rough texture with a reddish-brown color, growing in a bushy pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pale yellow petals and a structure that includes five sepals and five petals, blooming in the spring and being pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes totonaca is a flowering plant native to Mexico, specifically found in the states of Puebla and Tlaxcala.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to fragmented areas within its native range due to habitat loss and human activity. It thrives in dry, rocky soils in tropical and subtropical environments, typically in open woodlands and grasslands. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and declining population, Achyranthes totonaca is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
