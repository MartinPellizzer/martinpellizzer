                <h1>Achyranthes totonaca</h1>
<p>Achyranthes totonaca, commonly known as Mexican knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant features erect stems that are often reddish in color and covered with small, sticky hairs. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a distinctive reddish or purple hue on the underside.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes totonaca has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually 5–15 cm long and 2–5 cm wide, with a smooth or slightly hairy upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and somewhat woody, with a rough, brownish bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in racemose inflorescences, blooming from spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes totonaca is primarily native to the central and southern regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in states such as Veracruz, Puebla, and Oaxaca. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical forests, often near streams or in moist, shaded areas. It is an herbaceous plant that thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes totonaca was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is often found in the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Oklahoma. Its introduction is likely due to human activities such as agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
