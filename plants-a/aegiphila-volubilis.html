<p>Aegiphila volubilis, commonly known as the creeping aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. Its leaves are often hairy and have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Aegiphila volubilis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila volubilis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, slightly woody texture, and a pale greenish-brown color, growing in a climbing or trailing pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with tubular structures and a pale yellow to greenish hue, blooming during the spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects.
