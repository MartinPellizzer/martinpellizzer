                    <h1>Arabis howellii</h1>
<p>Arabis howellii, commonly known as Howell's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in mountainous regions. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
