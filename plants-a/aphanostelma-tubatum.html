                    <h1>Aphanostelma tubatum</h1>
<p>Aphanostelma tubatum, commonly known as the cushion lichen, is a member of the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen that forms dense, cushion-like growths on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which together perform photosynthesis and nutrient absorption. Its structure provides protection against desiccation and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Aphanostelma tubatum is often found in regions with low humidity and high solar exposure, such as deserts and rocky outcrops.</p>
