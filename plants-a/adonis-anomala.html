                <h1>Adonis anomala</h1>
<p>Adonis anomala, commonly known as the autumn crocus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple or yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, saucer-shaped blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun conditions.</p>
<p>Adonis anomala is also known for its toxic properties, containing protoanemonin, which can be harmful if ingested.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis anomala has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are trifoliate, with oval-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and pale underneath.</p>
<p>The stems are hairy, somewhat woody, and have a reddish-brown color, growing in a spreading or upright pattern. The flowers are yellow, with a single pistil and numerous stamens, blooming in early spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis anomala is primarily native to southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and arid environments, including mountainous regions and dry grasslands. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with limestone substrates. Its distribution extends across countries such as Spain, Italy, Morocco, and Turkey.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the flora in these regions, particularly in Mediterranean climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis anomala was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It has been documented in disturbed sites such as roadsides, grasslands, and open woodlands. The plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is likely due to human activities, including seed dispersal through agricultural practices or horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It is now a concern for land managers due to its potential to alter local ecosystems.</p>
