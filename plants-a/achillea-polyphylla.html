                <h1>Achillea polyphylla</h1>
<p>Achillea polyphylla, commonly known as field yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, flat-topped flower heads composed of numerous small white or pale yellow florets. The plant features finely divided, silver-green leaves that are aromatic and often used in herbal medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its historical use dates back to ancient times, where it was believed to have healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea polyphylla has basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture and a slightly hairy surface, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, covered in fine hairs, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. The flowers are flat-topped clusters of small, white to pale yellow petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense, spreading network that helps the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
