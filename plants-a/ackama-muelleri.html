                <h1>Ackama muelleri</h1>
<p>Ackama muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's ackama, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Ackama muelleri is often found in rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Ackama muelleri has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green, glossy upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Ackama muelleri is primarily native to the island of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the humid tropical rainforests of the eastern and southeastern regions of the island. This plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and rich, well-drained soil. It is commonly found in lowland and montane forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Ackama muelleri is also occasionally reported in adjacent parts of Australia, particularly in northern Queensland.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Ackama muelleri was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native habitats. The plant competes with native species for resources, leading to ecological concerns.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further environmental damage.</p>
