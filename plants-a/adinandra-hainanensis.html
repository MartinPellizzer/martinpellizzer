                <h1>Adinandra hainanensis</h1>
<p>Adinandra hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan adenium, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hainan in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its woody stem and dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests or on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra hainanensis has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically measuring around 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white or pale yellow petals and a tubular structure, blooming during the spring to early summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra hainanensis is primarily native to China Southeast, Hainan, Vietnam.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It typically grows in lowland and montane forests. Adinandra hainanensis is often associated with moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these geographic regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra hainanensis was mainly introduced to the region of Hainan Island in China.</p>
<p>It is a native species of China, specifically found in the tropical rainforests of Hainan. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections. Due to its limited natural range, it is not commonly found outside of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare and unique species.</p>
