<p>Arundinaria maximowiczii, commonly known as the Chinese bamboo or golden bamboo, is a species of grass native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces panicles of small, golden-yellow flowers, which are typically visible in the spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both ornamental and invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>The leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth, waxy surface that gives them a distinctive appearance.</p>
