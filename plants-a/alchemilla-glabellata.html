                    <h1>Alchemilla glabellata</h1>
<p>Alchemilla glabellata, commonly known as the smooth lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects the historical belief that it had medicinal properties, though modern uses are primarily ornamental.</p>
