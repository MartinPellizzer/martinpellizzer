                <h1>Actinocephalus bulbosus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus bulbosus, commonly known as the bulbous star-pear, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bulbous stem and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus bulbosus has a bulbous stem that is usually covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark.</p>
<p>It produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length and have a bluish-green color. The plant bears small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus bulbosus is primarily native to the arid regions of Southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in desert environments such as the Chihuahuan and Sonoran Deserts. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations. It is often seen growing in rocky crevices or along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the availability of limited water sources in these harsh landscapes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus bulbosus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant. The species has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some parts of its introduced range.</p>
