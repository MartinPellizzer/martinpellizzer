                <h1>Achyranthes geminata</h1>
<p>Achyranthes geminata, commonly known as red sandalwood, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands or scrublands.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which has been used historically for carving and construction.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes geminata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, and it grows in a spreading pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with greenish-white petals, and bloom from July to September; they are primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor firmly in the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes geminata is a shrub native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of South and Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. This plant thrives in moist, tropical environments, often growing in lowland areas near rivers and in forest edges. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 50 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Achyranthes geminata is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not under immediate threat of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyranthes geminata is a fast-growing annual plant commonly used for soil stabilization and as a forage crop.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, which are sown directly into well-prepared soil in early spring. The growth cycle of Achyranthes geminata is rapid, with germination occurring within 7-14 days and maturity reached in about 60-90 days.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, requiring more frequent irrigation during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to control height and promote bushiness are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with legumes can enhance nitrogen fixation and improve overall soil health.</p>
