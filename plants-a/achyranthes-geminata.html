                <h1>Achyranthes geminata</h1>
<p>Achyranthes geminata, commonly known as the Indian knotgrass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with erect, branched stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are borne on the upper part of the plant. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes geminata has compound leaves that are alternate, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets, typically 5â€“10 pairs per leaf, arranged in a feathery pattern, and have a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody at the base, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals, and bloom from April to June; they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes geminata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm, humid climates and is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides, wastelands, and agricultural fields. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is known for its adaptability to various environmental conditions. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands, where it has been introduced as a weed.</p>
<p>Due to its widespread distribution, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes geminata was mainly introduced to regions where its ecological and agricultural potential was recognized.</p>
<p>It has been distributed in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia due to its adaptability to various soil types and climates. The plant is often cultivated for its medicinal properties and as a forage crop. Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species in certain areas.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a beneficial plant in agricultural systems.</p>
