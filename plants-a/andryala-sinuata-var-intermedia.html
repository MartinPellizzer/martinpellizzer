                    <h1>Andryala sinuata var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Andryala sinuata var. intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features succulent, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping and erosion control in suitable climates.</p>
