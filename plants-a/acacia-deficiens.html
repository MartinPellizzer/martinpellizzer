                    <h1>Acacia deficiens</h1>
<p>Acacia deficiens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a shrub native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, bipinnate leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots and a capacity for dormancy during droughts.</p>
<p>Acacia deficiens plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
