                <h1>Actinella texana</h1>
<p>Actinella texana, commonly known as the Texas actinella, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette.</p>
<p>Actinella texana is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella texana has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes whitish underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 2–5 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with five petals, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella texana is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in Texas, New Mexico, and parts of Arizona. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often associated with limestone formations. It is adapted to hot, dry climates and can survive with minimal water.</p>
<p>Actinella texana is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella texana was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states like Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, gravel bars, and dry slopes. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments with well-drained soils. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various ecological zones within its range.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and plays a minor role in local ecosystems.</p>
