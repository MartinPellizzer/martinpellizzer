                    <h1>Acacia senegal var. fistula</h1>
<p>Acacia senegal var. fistula, commonly known as the gum arabic tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Sahel region of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorned stems, bipinnate leaves, and yellowish-green inflorescences that produce small, pod-like fruits. The plant is well-adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. It is particularly noted for producing a high-quality gum arabic, which is harvested from the exudation of its bark.</p>
<p>This gum is widely used in food, pharmaceutical, and industrial applications due to its unique properties.</p>
