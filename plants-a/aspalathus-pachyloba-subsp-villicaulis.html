<p>Aspalathus pachyloba subsp.</p>
<p>villicaulis, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant is closely related to the more well-known rooibos, but it is less commonly cultivated for commercial tea production. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and potential for genetic diversity.</p>
