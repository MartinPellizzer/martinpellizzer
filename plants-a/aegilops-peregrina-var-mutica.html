<p>Aegilops peregrina var. mutica, commonly known as the smooth wild emmer, is a wild relative of wheat native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its slender, branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown spikelets. It is notable for its genetic diversity and potential agricultural value due to its adaptation to arid environments.</p>
<p>Its genome has been studied for its role in wheat improvement and resistance to diseases and environmental stresses.</p>
