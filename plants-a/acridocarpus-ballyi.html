                <h1>Acridocarpus ballyi</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus ballyi, commonly known as the Bally's acridocarp, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes plants such as the cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody structure, typical of many species in its family. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a rough texture, while its fruits are small, fleshy drupes.</p>
<p>Acridocarpus ballyi is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus ballyi has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are typically green and have a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale greyish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus ballyi is primarily native to Kenya.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of the country, particularly in the southern and eastern parts. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity. It is commonly found in coastal forests and shrublands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Kenya.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus ballyi was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas where it thrives in warm, moist environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements and lack of natural dispersal mechanisms.</p>
