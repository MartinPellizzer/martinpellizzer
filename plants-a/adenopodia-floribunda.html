                <h1>Adenopodia floribunda</h1>
<p>Adenopodia floribunda, commonly known as the clustered leaf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often clustered together, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Its unique structure allows it to absorb nutrients through its leaves, making it a specialized carnivorous plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopodia floribunda has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and has a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, spreading just below the soil surface to absorb moisture and nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopodia floribunda is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically found in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps and in pine flatwoods. This plant is commonly observed in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It is often found in wetland environments and is adapted to the humid climate of the southeastern U.S. Its distribution is closely tied to the specific ecological conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopodia floribunda was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Oregon in the early 2000s. The plant has since spread to parts of Washington and British Columbia. It thrives in moist, shady environments along stream banks and forest floors.</p>
<p>Its introduction is believed to be due to accidental seed dispersal through human activities.</p>
