<p>Anathallis casualis, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a climbing epiphytic orchid native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a faint fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, typical of epiphytic growth.</p>
<p>Anathallis casualis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
