                    <h1>Astrolepis</h1>
<p>Astrolepis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a genus of ferns native to Africa, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their upright, sword-shaped fronds that are often glossy and dark green. Astrolepis species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. They have a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows them to spread and form dense clumps.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and indoor settings.</p>
