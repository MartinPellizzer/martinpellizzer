                        <h1>Acalypha scleroloba</h1>
<p>Acalypha scleroloba, commonly known as the hard-shelled spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short peduncles. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha scleroloba is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry and humid regions of the island, often growing in rocky or disturbed habitats. This plant is commonly seen in coastal areas and near human settlements. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the tropical climate of Madagascar.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha scleroloba was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage.</p>
<p>It was brought there in the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists seeking to add unique plant species to local gardens. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as streambanks and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means have made it a significant ecological concern in regions where it has established itself.</p>
