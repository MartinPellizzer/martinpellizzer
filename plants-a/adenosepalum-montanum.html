                <h1>Adenosepalum montanum</h1>
<p>Adenosepalum montanum, commonly known as the mountain adenosepalum, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine pubescence.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to cold, mountainous environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosepalum montanum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 3 to 6 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, smooth, and reddish-brown in color, with a climbing growth pattern that allows it to ascend trees or shrubs. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosepalum montanum is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean mountain ranges, where it thrives in high-altitude grasslands and open shrublands. This plant is adapted to the cool, temperate climates of these areas and often grows in rocky or well-drained soils. It is an important component of the local flora and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to the western part of the continent, with limited occurrences in neighboring regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosepalum montanum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond its original cultivation areas, particularly in the southeastern region. The plant is now considered invasive in some states, outcompeting native vegetation in disturbed sites. It thrives in moist, shady environments and can quickly form dense stands.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its further spread and impact on local ecosystems.</p>
