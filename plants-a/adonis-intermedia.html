                <h1>Adonis intermedia</h1>
<p>Adonis intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate adonis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five sepals and numerous stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis intermedia has alternate, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually gray-green in color, with a rough, hairy texture on the upper surface and a whitish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and branched, with a greenish-yellow bark that becomes rough and fissured with age. Its flowers are solitary, bright yellow, and have five petals with a prominent central stamen, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in rocky or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis intermedia is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes, cliffs, and scrublands. This plant is commonly found in countries like Spain, France, Italy, and Turkey. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Adonis intermedia is often associated with Mediterranean scrub ecosystems and is adapted to the region's climate and soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis intermedia was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states like California, Oregon, and Washington.</p>
<p>It was initially brought in for ornamental purposes due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native plants in disturbed soils. The plant thrives in open, sunny environments and can spread rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
