                    <h1>Astragalus murinus</h1>
<p>Astragalus murinus, commonly known as the sand milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Astragalus murinus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
