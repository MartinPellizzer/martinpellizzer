                        <h1>Acacia leptoneura</h1>
<p>Acacia leptoneura, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and phyllodes that are narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical spikes, which appear during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a feature common in many Acacia species, reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia leptoneura is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and fire.</p>
