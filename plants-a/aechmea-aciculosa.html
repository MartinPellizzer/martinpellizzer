                <h1>Aechmea aciculosa</h1>
<p>Aechmea aciculosa, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage composed of long, spiky, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's inflorescence consists of a tall, branched stem bearing striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>The plant's unique structure and vibrant floral display contribute to its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea aciculosa has rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a dark green color and a slightly waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, instead having a short, thick base that supports the rosette of leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, with small white to pink flowers that bloom in the summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its native habitat.</p>
