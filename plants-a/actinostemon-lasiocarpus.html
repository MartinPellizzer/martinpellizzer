                <h1>Actinostemon lasiocarpus</h1>
<p>Actinostemon lasiocarpus, commonly known as the silky-fruited bellflower, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in late summer. The plant has hairy, rough-textured leaves and stems, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemon lasiocarpus has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color that may have a slight pubescence on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, woody bark that is typically reddish-brown in color and exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and a tubular structure, blooming in early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
