<p>Atriplex collina, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant has small, greenish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring. Its succulent leaves store water, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Atriplex collina plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife in desert ecosystems.</p>
