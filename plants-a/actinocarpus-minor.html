                <h1>Actinocarpus minor</h1>
<p>Actinocarpus minor, commonly known as the small-fruited actinocarpus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Actinocarpus minor is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocarpus minor has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in racemes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal ingestion and excretion.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocarpus minor is primarily native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly associated with tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in lowland forests and secondary vegetation. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils, making it a characteristic species of the region's flora. Its distribution is largely limited to the Indo-Malayan region, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely cultivated outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocarpus minor was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become established in various regions of the country. The plant is commonly found in coastal and subcoastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a potential weed in some parts of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now limited to specific ecological zones where it can compete with native vegetation.</p>
