                <h1>Acrostichum pangoanum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum pangoanum, commonly known as the Pangoan fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pangoanum has leaves that are elongated, lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright with some branching. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom during the dry season, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, helping it thrive in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pangoanum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is commonly found in lowland rainforests and swampy areas. This plant is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and can be found along coastal areas and riverbanks. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of these habitats by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pangoanum was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as abandoned agricultural fields and along stream banks. This plant has been reported in several countries across Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Its introduction is often associated with human activities, such as land clearing and the spread of invasive species.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
