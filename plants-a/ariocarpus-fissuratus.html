                    <h1>Ariocarpus fissuratus</h1>
<p>Ariocarpus fissuratus, commonly known as the fissured liverwort, is a unique succulent plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in late spring, and its fruit is a distinctive, spiky capsule. Ariocarpus fissuratus is well adapted to extreme drought and can survive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
