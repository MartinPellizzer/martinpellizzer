                <h1>Acrolasia albicaulis</h1>
<p>Acrolasia albicaulis, commonly known as the white-stemmed acrolasia, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pale green stems that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth, glossy surface.</p>
<p>Acrolasia albicaulis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolasia albicaulis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a pale green upper surface, and a lighter green underside; the leaves are medium in size, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-white bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia albicaulis is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Bahamas, Cuba, Hispaniola, and parts of Jamaica. This plant thrives in coastal areas and is often associated with sandy soils near the shoreline. It is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific tropical regions due to its specialized habitat requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia albicaulis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive white flowers and compact growth habit. However, it has since become a weed in certain areas, particularly in coastal and disturbed habitats. The plant spreads through both seeds and vegetative propagation, making it difficult to control.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
