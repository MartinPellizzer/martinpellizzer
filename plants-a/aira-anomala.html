<p>Aira anomala, commonly known as the slender false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense clumps near water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by water or wind.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
