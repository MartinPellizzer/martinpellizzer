                <h1>Acrophorus tenuifolius</h1>
<p>Acrophorus tenuifolius, commonly known as the slender-leaf acrophorus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus tenuifolius has elongated, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale gray bark that exudes a faint aromatic scent. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus tenuifolius is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is typically found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the region's rich biodiversity and specific ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus tenuifolius was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it can thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields. This plant is often spread through human activities, including the transportation of contaminated soil or plant material. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can outcompete native vegetation, altering local ecosystems.</p>
