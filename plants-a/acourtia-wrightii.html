                <h1>Acourtia wrightii</h1>
<p>Acourtia wrightii, commonly known as Wright's acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, and it produces small, yellow to white flowers.</p>
<p>Acourtia wrightii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia wrightii has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, typically ranging from 1 to 3 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and they grow in a bushy, compact form. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to stabilize the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia wrightii is primarily native to Arizona, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southwest, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with shrubland and desert environments. Acourtia wrightii is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for dry, sun-exposed habitats across the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia wrightii was mainly introduced to California, where it has become naturalized in certain coastal and inland areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils, often near the edges of dunes or in disturbed habitats. This plant is typically associated with the coastal sage scrub and chaparral ecosystems. Its introduction has led to its presence in several counties along the Southern California coast.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and is often regarded as a native or naturalized species in these regions.</p>
