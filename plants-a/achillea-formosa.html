                <h1>Achillea formosa</h1>
<p>Achillea formosa, commonly known as the showy yarrow, is a perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, flat-topped flower heads. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Achillea formosa is also valued for its medicinal properties and historical use in herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea formosa has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, dark green, and slightly hairy, arranged in a rosette pattern with a compact, low-growing habit.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and has a reddish-brown color, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are composite, with yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea formosa is a flowering plant native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is now also cultivated in other regions, including parts of Europe and North America, for its ornamental value. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Achillea formosa is currently listed as a species of concern in some areas due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea formosa is a hardy perennial known for its fluffy, yellow flowers and aromatic foliage, often used in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer, though division is more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a growth cycle that begins with new growth in spring, followed by flowering in late summer, and it goes dormant in winter, requiring minimal care during this period.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun, with moderate watering to avoid root rot. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or rust.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, rosemary, or echinacea can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea formosa is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both floral resources and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by improving soil conditions. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea formosa also contributes to biodiversity by supporting a diverse array of ecological interactions within its environment.</p>
