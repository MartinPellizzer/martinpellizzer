<p>Agropyron dagnae, commonly known as the Dagnae needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed soils and is adapted to dry, nutrient-poor environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches.</p>
<p>Agropyron dagnae is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in arid regions.</p>
