<p>Abies douglasii var. pendula, commonly known as the hanging Douglas fir, is a variant of the Douglas fir native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its drooping branches, which give it a distinctive, weeping appearance. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, with a slightly resinous scent. It produces cones that hang downward, a feature that sets it apart from other fir species.</p>
<p>This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
