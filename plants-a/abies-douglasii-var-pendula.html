<p>Abies douglasii var. pendula, commonly known as the hanging Douglas fir, is a variant of the Douglas fir native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its drooping branches, which give it a distinctive, weeping appearance. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, with a slightly resinous scent. It produces cones that hang downward, a feature that sets it apart from other fir species.</p>
<p>This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<p>Abies douglasii var. pendula is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in regions of California, Oregon, and Nevada.</p>
<p>This variant of the Douglas fir is found in high elevation areas, often in coniferous forests and subalpine zones. It thrives in cooler, moist climates with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly associated with mountainous terrain and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies douglasii var. pendula was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool climates, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
