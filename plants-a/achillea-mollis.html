                <h1>Achillea mollis</h1>
<p>Achillea mollis, commonly known as velvetleaf yarrow, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are soft to the touch due to their dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads in shades of white, pink, or lavender, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its common name honors the Greek hero Achilles, who was said to have used the plant to treat wounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea mollis has leaves that are basal, spoon-shaped (spatulate), and covered in soft, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged in a rosette, are narrow, and range in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length. The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a growth pattern that is typically branched towards the top. The flowers are small, yellowish-white, and arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea mollis is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, particularly in temperate climates. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. It typically grows at altitudes between 0 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea mollis is not considered threatened and is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea mollis is a low-maintenance, hardy perennial known for its fluffy, soft foliage and delicate flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, though it often behaves as a short-lived perennial in cooler climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with full sun and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flower stalks to encourage a second bloom. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea mollis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea mollis also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health through its natural properties.</p>
