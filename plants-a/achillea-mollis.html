                <h1>Achillea mollis</h1>
<p>Achillea mollis, commonly known as velvetleaf yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, silvery-green foliage that gives it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads composed of numerous small white to pale yellow florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Achillea mollis is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea mollis has leaves that are soft, hairy, and broadly lance-shaped, with a gray-green color and a woolly texture, arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, slightly hairy, and have a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clumping pattern. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and form flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish in various environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea mollis is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. This plant thrives in regions with mild, wet winters and dry summers. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of Nevada and southern Idaho as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea mollis was mainly introduced to control erosion and as an ornamental plant in gardens due to its attractive white flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in regions where it has been planted. This plant is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range in parts of Europe and into North America.</p>
