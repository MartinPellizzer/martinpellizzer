                        <h1>Acetosella ornata</h1>
<p>Acetosella ornata, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Acetosella ornata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
