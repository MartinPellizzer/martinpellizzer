                    <h1>Abacopteris penangiana</h1>
<p>Abacopteris penangiana, commonly known as the Penang ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, translucent white petals and a unique, ghost-like appearance that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its flowers are small and delicate, often appearing in clusters during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Abacopteris penangiana is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and illegal collection.</p>
