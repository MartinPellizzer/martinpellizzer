                    <h1>Angraecopsis amaniensis</h1>
<p>Angraecopsis amaniensis, commonly known as the Amani orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in high-altitude grasslands and rocky outcrops, where it relies on specific pollinators, particularly moths, for reproduction. Its unique floral structure and habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable.</p>
