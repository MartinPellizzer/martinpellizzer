                <h1>Actinodaphne kweichowensis</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne kweichowensis, commonly known as the Yunnan camphor tree, is a member of the Lauraceae family and is native to southern China.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lanceolate, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by elliptical, dark blue-black fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural and traditional uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne kweichowensis has lance-shaped,革质 (leathery) leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing by birds through seed ingestion.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded forest soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne kweichowensis is a rare evergreen tree native to China, specifically found in the Yunnan and Guizhou provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It thrives in humid, tropical and subtropical environments, typically growing in dense forests with high canopy cover. This species is found at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Actinodaphne kweichowensis is listed as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne kweichowensis is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed germination or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. This plant thrives in partial to full shade, preferring well-draining, loamy soil and consistent moisture without waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring and summer supports healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourages new shoots.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or fungal issues in humid conditions, making companion planting with marigolds or garlic helpful for natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne kweichowensis is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of the local ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native flora in the surrounding area. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of the region.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne kweichowensis is a plant native to China, known for its diverse uses and applications.</p>
