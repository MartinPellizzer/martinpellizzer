<p>Aspidium profereoides, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that are typically broad and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Aspidium profereoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
