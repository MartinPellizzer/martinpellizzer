<p>Anathallis adenochila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and delicate, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Anathallis adenochila is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for continued research and protection efforts.</p>
