                <h1>Actaea yunnanensis</h1>
<p>Actaea yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan black cohosh, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, palmately compound leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces red berries that contain seeds, and it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Actaea yunnanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea yunnanensis has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a single main stem. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in upright clusters during late spring to early summer, with a simple structure that is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, spherical berry containing multiple seeds, which are dispersed by birds and other animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant to anchor itself and store nutrients.</p>

<p>Actaea yunnanensis is primarily native to China North-Central and China South-Central.</p>
<p>This plant is found in regions that include parts of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. It typically grows in mountainous areas with moist, temperate climates. The species is adapted to forested environments and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its native range is characterized by high elevation and diverse microhabitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea yunnanensis was mainly introduced to temperate regions with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas and mountainous regions where it thrives in cooler climates. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its showy, dark purple flowers. It has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections due to its unique appearance and ecological benefits.</p>
