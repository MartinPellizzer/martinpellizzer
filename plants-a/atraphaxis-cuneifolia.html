                    <h1>Atraphaxis cuneifolia</h1>
<p>Atraphaxis cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf desertweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils and low moisture environments.</p>
<p>Atraphaxis cuneifolia plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems.</p>
