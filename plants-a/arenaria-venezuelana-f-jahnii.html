                    <h1>Arenaria venezuelana f. jahnii</h1>
<p>Arenaria venezuelana f. jahnii, commonly known as the Venezuelan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andean regions of Venezuela.</p>
<p>It features small, succulent leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the spring and summer months, which are arranged in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists studying plant responses to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
