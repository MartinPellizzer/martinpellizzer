<p>Aconitum nivatum, commonly known as the snowdrop aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the top of its tall, sparsely leafy stems. The plant is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>Aconitum nivatum is also notable for containing potent toxins, making it both beautiful and dangerous.</p>
