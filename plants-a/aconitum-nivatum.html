                <h1>Aconitum nivatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum nivatum, commonly known as the snowdrop aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the top of its tall, sparsely leafy stems. The plant is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>Aconitum nivatum is also notable for containing potent toxins, making it both beautiful and dangerous.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum nivatum has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically reaching up to 15 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hollow, and has a smooth, bluish-green bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are blue to violet, bell-shaped, and clustered in racemes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, aiding in the plant's survival in cold, alpine environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum nivatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This species is well adapted to cold climates and is typically found at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,500 meters. It is also present in parts of the Russian Caucasus and northern Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum nivatum was mainly introduced to Europe through human activity, particularly during the 18th and 19th centuries.</p>
<p>It was initially brought for ornamental purposes due to its striking white flowers and unique appearance. The plant has since naturalized in certain regions, often found in moist, shaded woodland areas. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a non-invasive species in most parts of its introduced range.</p>
