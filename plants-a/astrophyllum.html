<p>It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy stems that store water, and their spiny, leafless appearance adapted to harsh desert conditions.

<p>Astrophyllum species are often found growing on rocky outcrops and in crevices, where they thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
