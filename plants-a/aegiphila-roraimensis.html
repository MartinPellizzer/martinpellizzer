                <h1>Aegiphila roraimensis</h1>
<p>Aegiphila roraimensis, commonly known as Roraima's aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of southern Venezuela and northern Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, narrow leaves, and small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of purple and blue. It thrives in the humid, nutrient-poor soils of the highland regions, often growing in rocky or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila roraimensis has compound, pinnate leaves that are elongated and lanceolate, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, with five petals and a tubular corolla, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>
