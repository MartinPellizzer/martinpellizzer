                <h1>Adenocalymma ternatum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma ternatum, commonly known as the three-lobed adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers. It typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma ternatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma ternatum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is generally gray to brown in color, and it grows in a shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pale yellow petals and a tubular structure, blooming in spring and attracting insects for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma ternatum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of the Northern Cape provinces. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops and mountainous regions. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma ternatum is often found in open vegetation types such as renosterveld and fynbos.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma ternatum was mainly introduced to the eastern and central regions of the United States, particularly in states like Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun. This plant is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily. Its distribution has expanded in recent decades due to human activity and climate change.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but can outcompete native vegetation in certain habitats.</p>
