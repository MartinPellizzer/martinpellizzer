                <h1>Acronia pallida</h1>
<p>Acronia pallida, commonly known as the pale acronia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Acronia pallida is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of ecological health.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia pallida has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a pale green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale gray bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils it inhabits.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia pallida is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, including dunes and sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This plant thrives in well-drained, sandy environments and is often associated with maritime ecosystems. Acronia pallida is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding from tides.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution reflects its specialized habitat requirements and sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia pallida was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along fence rows.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to a variety of disturbed sites. The plant's ability to spread through its seeds allows it to colonize new areas quickly, contributing to its invasive potential. It is commonly found in the eastern and central United States, where it has displaced native vegetation in some regions.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth and lack of natural predators, it poses a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
