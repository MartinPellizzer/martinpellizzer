                <h1>Achillea gypsicola</h1>
<p>Achillea gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum yarrow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pale yellow. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea gypsicola has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of ray florets in white or pale yellow, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, calcareous soils it inhabits.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea gypsicola is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, specifically found in countries like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations, primarily in arid and semi-arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and dry grasslands, often growing on slopes and in crevices. The plant is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat degradation, Achillea gypsicola is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea gypsicola is a hardy perennial plant known for its vibrant yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The growth cycle of Achillea gypsicola includes a period of active growth in spring, flowering in late summer, and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, making it ideal for rock gardens. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in early spring, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sage enhances its growth and repels pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea gypsicola is a hardy plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering food and shelter. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its deep root system, stabilizing soil in arid or rocky environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea gypsicola contributes to the ecological balance by improving soil structure and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea gypsicola is a plant native to certain regions of Europe and has limited documented uses compared to other members of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, some local traditions may incorporate it into herbal teas or infusions. Its medicinal properties are not well-studied, but like other yarrow species, it may have potential anti-inflammatory or antiseptic qualities. In industrial and economic contexts, it has minimal role, as it is not cultivated for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local folklore or traditional medicine practices, though this remains under-researched.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea gypsicola has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental appeal and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' and 'Purpurea,' which are known for their striking yellow and purple foliage, respectively. While there are fewer hybrids specifically developed for Achillea gypsicola compared to other yarrow species, some horticultural crosses have been made to enhance flower color and disease resistance. These plants are important in horticulture for their ability to thrive in poor soils and their long-lasting blooms.</p>
<p>Their use in gardens and landscaping highlights their ecological and aesthetic value.</p>
