                <h1>Achillea gypsicola</h1>
<p>Achillea gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often found on limestone or gypsum substrates. Its leaves are basal, silver-green, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching.</p>
<p>Achillea gypsicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea gypsicola has leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and branching, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding brown disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to thrive in arid, calcareous soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea gypsicola is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia, particularly in parts of Kazakhstan and southern Russia.</p>
<p>It is currently found in limited areas within its native range, with some populations also occurring in western China. This plant thrives in dry, rocky environments, often growing on saline or gypsum soils. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Achillea gypsicola is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea gypsicola is a hardy perennial plant known for its resilience and ornamental value, commonly grown in rocky or dry soils.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing established clumps, with the best results achieved in early spring or fall. The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity within 2-3 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of compost in early spring, while pruning is best done after flowering to encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions, and it pairs well with drought-tolerant plants like lavender and yarrow in companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea gypsicola is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering both floral resources and potential shelter. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared resources and habitat. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil in arid or rocky environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea gypsicola contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and maintaining the balance of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea gypsicola is a plant that has limited documented uses and applications due to its restricted geographic distribution and limited research.</p>
<p>It is not widely used in culinary practices, as it does not possess notable edible qualities. In medicinal applications, it may have some local traditional uses, though scientific evidence supporting its efficacy is scarce. Industrially, it does not hold significant economic value or contribute to major industries.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic meaning in certain regions, but its role in folklore or symbolism is not well-documented.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea gypsicola has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Pink Beauty' and 'Silver King,' which are appreciated for their striking foliage and flower colors. Hybrids of Achillea gypsicola are often created to enhance traits such as disease resistance and bloom duration. These plants hold horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in rocky or dry soils.</p>
<p>They are commonly used in xeriscaping and as ground covers in gardens with limited water availability.</p>
