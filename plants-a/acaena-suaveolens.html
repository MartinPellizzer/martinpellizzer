<p>Acaena suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rosaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats.</p>
<p>Acaena suaveolens has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena suaveolens is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate and subantarctic areas, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in mountainous regions and is often associated with forest understories. It is also present in parts of New Zealand, where it has been introduced and naturalized.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to cool, humid climates with well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena suaveolens was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
