<p>Adelopetalum lilianae, commonly known as the Lilian's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Adelopetalum lilianae is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude habitats.</p>
