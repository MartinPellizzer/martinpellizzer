                    <h1>Agave zebra</h1>
<p>Agave zebra, commonly known as the zebra agave, is a striking succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and its distinctive blue-green leaves with white or light green stripes. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, and can be used to make agave nectar or fiber.</p>
