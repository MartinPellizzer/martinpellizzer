                <h1>Achillea moschata</h1>
<p>Achillea moschata, commonly known as sweet yarrow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of gray-green, lance-shaped leaves and produces flat, fragrant clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its aromatic foliage, which emits a subtle, pleasant scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes.</p>
<p>Its historical use in herbal medicine is attributed to its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea moschata has basal, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, with a rough, hairy texture, and they are arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly reddish-brown in color, growing from the base upwards. The flowers are clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white petals and yellow centers, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, allowing wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea moschata is a perennial herb native to southern and eastern Europe, including parts of Turkey, the Mediterranean region, and the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including North America and Australia, for its ornamental value and medicinal properties. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas, often found in sunny environments. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea moschata is not considered endangered and is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although its wild populations are relatively limited in range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea moschata is a hardy perennial herb known for its aromatic foliage and yellow flowers, commonly used in gardens for its ornamental and medicinal value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division of established plants, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, though it often behaves as a short-lived perennial in colder climates, flowering in the second year before dying back.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its vigor, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea moschata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other herbs to enhance their growth and deter pests. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>It also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
