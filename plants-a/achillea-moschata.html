                <h1>Achillea moschata</h1>
<p>Achillea moschata, commonly known as sweet yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems that are covered with fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels. Its aromatic foliage has a distinctive, pleasant scent, especially when crushed.</p>
<p>Achillea moschata is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea moschata has basal, gray-green, fern-like leaves that are finely divided, arranged in a rosette, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hollow, and covered with a rough, grayish-white bark, growing in a clumping pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to light pink ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) that is dispersed by wind due to its feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea moschata is primarily native to southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as the Mediterranean basin, including countries like Spain, Italy, and Greece. This plant thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. It is also known to grow in areas with well-drained soil and mild to warm climates.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of the Middle East and the Caucasus region as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea moschata was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and disturbed soils across the eastern and central United States. The plant has also spread into natural areas, where it can compete with native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain regions.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, careful management is recommended to prevent it from becoming a weed.</p>
