                <h1>Acipetalum rugosum</h1>
<p>Acipetalum rugosum, commonly known as the rough acipetalum, is a shrub native to the western regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its botanical features include a woody stem and opposite leaf arrangement.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky or dry habitats, showcasing its adaptability to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acipetalum rugosum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, woody bark that is often grayish-brown in color and exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acipetalum rugosum is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern Brazil. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with disturbed habitats such as secondary forests and open areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acipetalum rugosum was mainly introduced to the eastern and southeastern United States, where it has established itself in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, wastelands, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in states like Florida, Georgia, and Texas, where its adaptability to various soil types and climates has allowed it to thrive. The plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through human activity, including accidental transport via contaminated soil or seeds.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive nature, Acipetalum rugosum has become an important species in ecological studies due to its ecological impact and resilience.</p>
