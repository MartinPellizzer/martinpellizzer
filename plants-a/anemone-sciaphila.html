                    <h1>Anemone sciaphila</h1>
<p>Anemone sciaphila, commonly known as the shade anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the forests of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found under the canopy of hardwood trees. The plant produces delicate, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive yellow center, resembling those of true anemones. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a broad, lobed shape that helps it capture limited sunlight.</p>
<p>Anemone sciaphila is valued in woodland gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to native pollinators.</p>
