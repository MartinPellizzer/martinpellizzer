                    <h1>Agrostis exarata var. littoralis</h1>
<p>Agrostis exarata var. littoralis, commonly known as salt meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass species.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in coastal environments, particularly in salt marshes and sandy shores. The plant is adapted to saline conditions, with mechanisms to tolerate high salt concentrations in its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>This variant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
