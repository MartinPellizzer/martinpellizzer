                    <h1>Alloiatheros</h1>
<p>Alloiatheros, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the summer months. Alloiatheros thrives in wet, acidic pine flatwoods and is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is listed as an endangered species.</p>
