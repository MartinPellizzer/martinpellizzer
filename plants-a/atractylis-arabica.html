<p>Atractylis arabica, commonly known as the Arabica marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Atractylis arabica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in herbal medicine.</p>
