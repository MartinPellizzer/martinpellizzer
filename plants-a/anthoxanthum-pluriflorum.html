<p>Anthoxanthum pluriflorum, commonly known as the common oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Anthoxanthum pluriflorum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
