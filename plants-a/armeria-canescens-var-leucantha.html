                    <h1>Armeria canescens var. leucantha</h1>
<p>Armeria canescens var. leucantha, commonly known as the white sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Its foliage is covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
