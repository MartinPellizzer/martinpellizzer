<p>Abelmoschus moschatus var. multiformis, commonly known as okra, is a flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Africa and Asia and is characterized by its spiny stems and capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. The plant produces edible capsules that are widely used in culinary applications across various cultures. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically yellow or pale green and are pollinated by insects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus moschatus var. multiformis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dull green color and serrated margins.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are yellow with red stamens, arranged in clusters, bloom from summer to autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus moschatus var. multiformis is a variant of the okra plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Nigeria and Sudan.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including South Asia, the Middle East, and some regions of the Americas. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is commonly found in agricultural fields and along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its conservation status is largely dependent on agricultural practices and habitat preservation.</p>
