                    <h1>Alyssum argenteum var. alpestriforme</h1>
<p>Alyssum argenteum var. alpestriforme, commonly known as silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a layer of fine, hairy covering, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies.</p>
