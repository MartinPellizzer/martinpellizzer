                        <h1>Abacopteris glandulosa</h1>
<p>Abacopteris glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky matted rock-rose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with dense clusters of small, glandular leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract nectar-feeding insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abacopteris glandulosa belongs to the kingdom Plantae, phylum Magnoliophyta, class Equisetopsida, subclass Equisetoideae, order Equisetales, family Equisetaceae, genus Abacopteris, and species glandulosa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the clubmoss group, characterized by its spore-producing structures and primitive vascular system. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with rocky or forested areas. The genus Abacopteris is known for its unique morphological features, including the presence of glandular structures on its stems.</p>
<p>Its classification reflects its evolutionary position within the ancient lineage of vascular plants.</p>
