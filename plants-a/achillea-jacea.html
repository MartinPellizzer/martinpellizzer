                <h1>Achillea jacea</h1>
<p>Achillea jacea, commonly known as yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features basal leaves that are linear to lance-shaped and gray-green in color, often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called umbels.</p>
<p>Achillea jacea is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, and it has been used historically for its medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea jacea has basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture and a slightly hairy surface, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and reddish-brown in color, with a branching growth pattern that becomes more branched as the plant matures. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea jacea is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, particularly found in the British Isles, France, and parts of Scandinavia.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to parts of North America, where it has been introduced and sometimes becomes naturalized. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and coastal areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Achillea jacea is generally considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though its population can be affected by habitat loss and changes in land use.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea jacea is a hardy perennial plant known for its bright yellow flowers and aromatic foliage, commonly used in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a dormant winter growth cycle, blooming in early summer and going dormant in late fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea jacea is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea jacea contributes to biodiversity by supporting a variety of ecological interactions in its native habitats.</p>
