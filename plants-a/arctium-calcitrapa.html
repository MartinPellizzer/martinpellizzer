<p>Arctium calcitrapa, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces purple to pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its root system is extensive, and the roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Arctium calcitrapa thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
