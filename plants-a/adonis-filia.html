                <h1>Adonis filia</h1>
<p>Adonis filia, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis filia has compound, pinnate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with lance-shaped leaflets that are usually dark green and slightly hairy.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a branching pattern. Its flowers are showy, with yellow petals and a red center, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in its preferred rocky habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis filia is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and limestone soils at high altitudes, often found in alpine meadows and open slopes. This plant is also present in parts of North Africa, including Morocco and Algeria, where it adapts to similar environmental conditions. It is commonly found in areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis filia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats, including grasslands and forest margins. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have contributed to its establishment in the wild. It is considered a potential weed in some regions, raising concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to monitor and manage its distribution to prevent further spread.</p>
