                    <h1>Atriplex coronata var. verna</h1>
<p>Atriplex coronata var. verna, commonly known as spring saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its ability to thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments.</p>
