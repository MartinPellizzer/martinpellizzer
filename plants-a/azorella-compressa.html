<p>Azorella compressa, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of South America.</p>
<p>It forms dense, compact cushions of foliage that help it survive in cold, arid environments. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, reducing water loss and providing insulation. It produces yellow to orange flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Azorella compressa is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species in its native habitat.</p>
