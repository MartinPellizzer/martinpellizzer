<p>Aspidium cesatianum, commonly known as the European water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a rhizomatous structure and produces small, clustered fronds with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Aspidium cesatianum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>
