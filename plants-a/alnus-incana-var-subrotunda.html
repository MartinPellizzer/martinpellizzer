                    <h1>Alnus incana var. subrotunda</h1>
<p>Alnus incana var. subrotunda, commonly known as the rough alder or subrounded alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in riparian zones or along streams. The plant has compound leaves with serrated margins and small, catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation.</p>
<p>The bark is generally grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age.</p>
