                <h1>Acer italum var. hispanicum</h1>
<p>Acer italum var. hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by orange-red samaras in the autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with suitable growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. hispanicum has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, turning red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. hispanicum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically found in southern Spain.</p>
<p>While its native range was historically limited to this region, its current distribution is even more restricted due to habitat loss and fragmentation. It thrives in rocky, dry environments such as cliffs and slopes, typically at altitudes between 600 and 1,200 meters. Conservation status is critically endangered, as it is threatened by urbanization, agricultural expansion, and climate change.</p>
<p>Efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique species to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. hispanicum is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its vibrant fall foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning should focus on shaping and removing dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant perennials or shrubs can enhance its garden appeal and ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. hispanicum is a species of maple that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna. Its presence also aids in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which helps bind soil and prevent runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to multiple organisms within its native environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. hispanicum is a lesser-known maple species that has limited culinary use due to its small, bitter fruits, though it may be used in local traditional recipes.</p>
<p>It has some medicinal applications in traditional herbal practices, where its leaves and bark are used for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and ecological balance, supporting local wildlife and soil health. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in certain regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>However, its economic impact remains minimal compared to more widely cultivated maple species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. hispanicum has several popular cultivars, including 'Crimson King' and 'Globemaster', which are prized for their striking foliage and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>This variety is also commonly used in hybrid breeding programs to develop new ornamental maples with enhanced color and form. Hybrids involving Acer italum var. hispanicum often combine its vibrant fall color with the hardiness of other maple species. Its horticultural importance lies in its adaptability to various climates and its aesthetic value in landscaping.</p>
<p>Gardeners and horticulturists appreciate its role in creating visually appealing and resilient garden compositions.</p>
