                <h1>Aechmea flavorosea</h1>
<p>Aechmea flavorosea, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The leaves are typically dark green with a reddish or pinkish hue, especially along the edges. It produces vibrant red or pink flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, indirect light conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea flavorosea has strap-shaped, evergreen leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a bluish-green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, fibrous stem with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, branching spike of pale pink to white flowers, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed, fleshy capsule that disperses its seeds by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its epiphytic or terrestrial habitat.</p>
