                        <h1>Acanthostemma puberum</h1>
<p>Acanthostemma puberum, commonly known as the roughleaf acanthostemma, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthostemma puberum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and savanna habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient species in these regions. It is often seen in open areas with minimal vegetation cover.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthostemma puberum was mainly introduced to new areas as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for erosion control.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Australia. The plant's ability to thrive in disturbed soils has contributed to its spread in these environments. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
