<p>Aristolochia versicolor, commonly known as the variable Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, somewhat unpleasant odor. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed, and it thrives in moist, wooded areas. It is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value despite its noxious scent.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
