                <h1>Adenophora obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Adenophora obtusifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf bellflower, is a flowering plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Adenophora obtusifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora obtusifolia has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rounded or obtuse tip, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 2 to 6 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern that becomes more diffuse as the plant matures. The flowers are clustered in umbels, with white to pale blue petals, and bloom from June to August, relying on insect pollination, particularly by bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases small, smooth seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in moist, woodland environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora obtusifolia is primarily native to East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions and forested areas, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. This species thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with shaded or partially shaded environments. It is particularly common in the northeastern parts of China, such as in the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning.</p>
<p>Adenophora obtusifolia is also known to occur in some regions of the Russian Far East.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora obtusifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue to purple flowers and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. This species has since naturalized in wetland areas and along stream banks, spreading beyond its original cultivation sites. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to outcompete native plant species.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ecological benefits, such as providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
