                    <h1>Amauropelta piedrensis</h1>
<p>Amauropelta piedrensis, commonly known as the piedrensis shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the humid forests of southeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and restricted range make it an important subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
