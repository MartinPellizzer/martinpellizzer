                <h1>Acrosanthes humifusa</h1>
<p>Acrosanthes humifusa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed gloryflower, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a low-growing habit, featuring linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open forests or along streamlines.</p>
<p>Acrosanthes humifusa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrosanthes humifusa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5-10 cm in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is prostrate, with a smooth, pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal spikes, featuring white to pale yellow petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the winter months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habit of growing close to the ground in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosanthes humifusa is primarily native to the Cape Provinces and Namibia.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the southern regions of Namibia, particularly in the arid and semi-arid areas. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in open habitats. The species is adapted to the dry climate and can survive in low-water conditions.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific regions in southern Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosanthes humifusa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. The plant thrives in coastal and lowland environments, where it can grow in sandy or gravelly soils. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
