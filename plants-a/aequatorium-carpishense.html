                    <h1>Aequatorium carpishense</h1>
<p>Aequatorium carpishense, commonly known as the Carpish marsh orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the wetlands of the Carpish Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pale pink and white. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists studying wetland ecosystems.</p>
