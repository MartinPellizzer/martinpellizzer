<p>Anacamptis trichocera, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, erect flowering stem that bears a cluster of pale violet to blue-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in open woodland or grassland habitats. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees.</p>
<p>The species is relatively uncommon and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a notable subject in botanical studies.</p>
