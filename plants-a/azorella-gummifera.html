<p>Azorella gummifera, commonly known as the gummed azorella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andes Mountains of South America, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Azorella gummifera is also notable for producing a sticky, resinous substance from its stems.</p>
