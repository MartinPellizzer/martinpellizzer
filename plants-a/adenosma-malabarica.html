                <h1>Adenosma malabarica</h1>
<p>Adenosma malabarica, commonly known as the Malabar adenosma, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color.</p>
<p>Adenosma malabarica is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and thickets.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma malabarica has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter green underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, with a growth pattern that is either upright or slightly trailing. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma malabarica is primarily native to India.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southern regions of the country, particularly in the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and thickets. It is often associated with areas that have high humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>
<p>Adenosma malabarica is an important part of the local flora and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma malabarica was mainly introduced to new habitats in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is often found growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides, clearings, and along riverbanks. The plant has adapted well to these environments due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its introduction has led to its spread in natural ecosystems, sometimes outcompeting native species.</p>
<p>This distribution pattern highlights its potential as an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
