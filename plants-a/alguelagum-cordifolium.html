<p>Alguelagum cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaf tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are usually smooth and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red berries that are a food source for various wildlife. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant has a slow growth rate and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
