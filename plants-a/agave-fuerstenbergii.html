                    <h1>Agave fuerstenbergii</h1>
<p>Agave fuerstenbergii, commonly known as the Fuerstenberg's agave, is a striking succulent native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, blue-gray leaves that are lined with sharp spines, providing both structural support and a defense mechanism. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid landscapes and rock gardens.</p>
