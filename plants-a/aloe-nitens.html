                    <h1>Aloe nitens</h1>
<p>Aloe nitens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features upright, slender stems that bear fleshy, lance-shaped leaves with a pale green to blue-gray coloration. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red berries. Aloe nitens is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and requiring minimal irrigation.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
