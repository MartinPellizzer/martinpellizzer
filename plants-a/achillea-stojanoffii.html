                <h1>Achillea stojanoffii</h1>
<p>Achillea stojanoffii, commonly known as Stojanoff's yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and medicinal properties have made it of interest in traditional herbal practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea stojanoffii has leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a gray-green color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown color, and grows in a clumping pattern. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped umbels, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea stojanoffii is primarily native to Bulgaria.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Rila and Pirin Mountains. It thrives in rocky and sunny habitats, often growing on slopes and in alpine meadows. Its native distribution is limited to specific areas within Bulgaria, where it has adapted to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is an important component of the local flora and is often found in areas with minimal human disturbance.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea stojanoffii was mainly introduced to gardens and landscapes for its ornamental value, particularly its showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in cultivated areas where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. This plant has become naturalized in some regions, leading to its presence in wildflower meadows and disturbed sites. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, careful management is recommended to prevent its spread into native habitats.</p>
