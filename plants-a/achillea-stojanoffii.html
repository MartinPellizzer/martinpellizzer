                <h1>Achillea stojanoffii</h1>
<p>Achillea stojanoffii, commonly known as Stojanoff's yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to harsh environments. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea stojanoffii has basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, with a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation and measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green color, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are small, composite yellowish-white blooms arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea stojanoffii is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southeastern Europe, particularly in countries such as Austria, Croatia, Hungary, and parts of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is currently found in limited areas, primarily in the Carpathian and Dinaric mountain ranges. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and forest edges. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat loss, Achillea stojanoffii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea stojanoffii is a hardy, perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region, known for its compact growth and bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of established clumps, with the best results achieved in early spring or fall. This plant has a slow growth cycle, typically blooming in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It requires minimal watering, as overwatering can lead to root rot, and a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring can promote healthy growth. Pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases, though it may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and provide natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea stojanoffii is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its pest-repelling properties. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Achillea stojanoffii also contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea stojanoffii is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia, known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscaping due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, some traditional uses may involve its aromatic properties. In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though scientific validation remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators, enhancing ecological balance.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local traditions, though specific meanings are not well documented.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea stojanoffii has several popular cultivars that are favored in gardens for their ornamental value, including 'Palla' and 'Lunaria,' which are known for their striking silver foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used as a parent in hybrid breeding, it has contributed to the genetic diversity of other Achillea species, leading to the development of some hybrid varieties. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant is also valued for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea stojanoffii remains an important species in the Asteraceae family for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
