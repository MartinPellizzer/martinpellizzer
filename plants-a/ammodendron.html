<p>Ammodendron, commonly known as the desert date or goat's beard, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Chenopodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, where they thrive in harsh, dry environments. Ammodendron species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their thick, fleshy leaves and showy, yellow or orange flowers.
