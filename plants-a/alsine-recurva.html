                    <h1>Alsine recurva</h1>
<p>Alsine recurva, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It has small, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Alsine recurva is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
