                <h1>Ackermania hajekii</h1>
<p>Ackermania hajekii, commonly known as the Hajek's ackermania, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and creek banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a distinct hairy texture.</p>
<p>Ackermania hajekii is noted for its small, yellowish to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological significance in supporting local pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Ackermania hajekii has leaves that are simple, ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unbranched throughout its growth. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loose soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Ackermania hajekii is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the states of Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions and is often associated with areas that experience seasonal flooding. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of these wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Ackermania hajekii is also occasionally found in adjacent upland areas that are periodically inundated.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Ackermania hajekii was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Florida and has since spread to other southern states. This plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in disturbed soils and can colonize wetlands and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
