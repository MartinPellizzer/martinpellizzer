                    <h1>Aria ulmifolia</h1>
<p>Aria ulmifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping habit and its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Aria ulmifolia is often found in riparian zones and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
