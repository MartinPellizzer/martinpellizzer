                <h1>Acer oblongum var. omeiense</h1>
<p>Acer oblongum var. omeiense, commonly known as the Omei maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter green beneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. omeiense has elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm long, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on top and lighter underneath, turning red in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in clusters, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the mountainous habitats where the plant is found.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. omeiense is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province in southwestern China.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited to these high-altitude areas, it is now cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta around the world. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in temperate forests. This species grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited natural population, it is considered a conservation concern and is often protected in its native region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. omeiense is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining specific cultivar traits. The growth cycle includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. omeiense is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. omeiense is a species of maple native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife, though it has limited direct economic use. Culturally, it is valued in traditional Chinese horticulture and symbolizes resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in landscaping and conservation efforts highlights its importance in both environmental and aesthetic contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. omeiense has several popular cultivars that are favored for their ornamental value, such as 'Variegatum' and 'Atrosanguineum', which display striking foliage colors.</p>
<p>It is also involved in the creation of hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the diversity of maple trees in horticulture. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced cold hardiness and unique leaf patterns, making them desirable for landscape design. The variety's adaptability to different climates has increased its horticultural importance in gardens and parks.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer oblongum var. omeiense plays a significant role in the cultivation of ornamental maples worldwide.</p>
