                    <h1>Asplenium caespitosum</h1>
<p>Asplenium caespitosum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small evergreen fern native to various regions of the world, including Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on cliffs or in crevices, where it thrives in moist, humid conditions. The plant has a compact, clumping growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery or rusty hairs. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Asplenium caespitosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
