                    <h1>Aloe paedogona</h1>
<p>Aloe paedogona, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or miniature aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a powdery white coating, known as farina. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Aloe paedogona is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight.</p>
<p>Its compact size makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
