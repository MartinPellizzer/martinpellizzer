<p>Anthurium archilae, commonly known as the giant arrowhead plant, is a tropical species native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length, often with a striking green to red coloration. The plant produces spadices, which are specialized inflorescences that house the actual flowers, typically hidden within a showy spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Anthurium archilae is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and air-purifying qualities.</p>
