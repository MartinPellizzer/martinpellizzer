                <h1>Adhatoda lithospermifolia</h1>
<p>Adhatoda lithospermifolia, commonly known as the Chinese skullcap, is a flowering plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda lithospermifolia has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda lithospermifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments like forests and rocky hillsides. This plant is commonly associated with the Indian subcontinent and parts of southern China. It is typically found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda lithospermifolia was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species and restore ecological balance in degraded habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with disturbed soils and semi-arid climates, where it helps prevent soil erosion. This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize bare areas. Its introduction has been documented in several countries, including China, India, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-target environments.</p>
