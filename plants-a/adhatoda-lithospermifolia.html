<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda lithospermifolia has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually green on top and lighter in color underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the summer months and pollinated by insects.

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda lithospermifolia is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and Thailand, in recent decades. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes, often found in areas with high humidity. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Adhatoda lithospermifolia is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda lithospermifolia is a hardy, medicinal plant that thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for faster growth. The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity in 2-3 years, and prefers well-drained soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization with a balanced organic fertilizer in spring and regular pruning to encourage bushiness are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or fungal issues in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and improve soil health.</p>
