                    <h1>Arachniodes calcarata</h1>
<p>Arachniodes calcarata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that are often divided into narrow, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
