                <h1>Achillea myriophylla</h1>
<p>Achillea myriophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea myriophylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea myriophylla has basal, fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a dark green color and a silvery-white underside, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-green color, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called cymes, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) that is dispersed by wind due to its feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea myriophylla is primarily native to the western United States, including California, Oregon, and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Baja California, Mexico. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. It is commonly seen in areas with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the coastal and inland regions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea myriophylla was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive, feathery flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and cultivated areas where it is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for borders and rock gardens. Despite its ornamental use, it can sometimes become invasive in certain regions if not properly managed.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, particularly in temperate climates where it is cultivated extensively.</p>
