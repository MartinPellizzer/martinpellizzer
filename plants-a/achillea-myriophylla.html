                <h1>Achillea myriophylla</h1>
<p>Achillea myriophylla, commonly known as yarrow, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. The plant features feathery, fern-like leaves and flat clusters of small, white or pink flowers. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Achillea myriophylla is also a popular garden plant due to its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea myriophylla has narrow, gray-green leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“15 cm in length, with a silvery-white underside.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, hairy, and have a greenish-gray bark, growing in dense clumps. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea myriophylla is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as Spain, Portugal, and southern France, where it thrives in rocky and coastal environments. This species typically grows in well-drained soils and prefers sunny, open habitats like cliffs, slopes, and coastal dunes. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Achillea myriophylla is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though it is sometimes threatened by habitat loss and urbanization.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea myriophylla is a hardy perennial known for its fluffy, yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, especially in hot climates. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its appearance and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea myriophylla is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea myriophylla contributes to the ecological balance by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>
