                    <h1>Armeria lacaitae</h1>
<p>Armeria lacaitae, commonly known as the Cape Verde sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the island of Santiago in the Cape Verde archipelago.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-forming foliage composed of linear, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the cooler months, typically from October to March. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun exposure, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
