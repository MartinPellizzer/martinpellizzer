<p>Agrostis billardierei var. tenuiseta, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with fine, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens or used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
