                    <h1>Aphyllon fasciculatum</h1>
<p>Aphyllon fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered leafless plant, is a member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of true leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that are typically clustered in groups. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations.</p>
