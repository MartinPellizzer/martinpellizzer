                    <h1>Aloe × hexapetala</h1>
<p>Aloe × hexapetala, commonly known as the hybrid aloe or the six-petaled aloe, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Aloe vera and Aloe arborescens.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences with six to eight bright yellow flowers arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge at the edges. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its beauty rather than for its medicinal properties.</p>
