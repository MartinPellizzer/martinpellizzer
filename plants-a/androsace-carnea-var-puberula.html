                    <h1>Androsace carnea var. puberula</h1>
<p>Androsace carnea var. puberula, commonly known as the pink snowbell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, rocky environments. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in meadows and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
