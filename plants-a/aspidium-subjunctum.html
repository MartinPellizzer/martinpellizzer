<p>Aspidium subjunctum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Aspidium subjunctum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through its filtration capabilities.</p>
