                    <h1>Aretiastrum</h1>
<p>Aretiastrum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their succulent, often hairy leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Aretiastrum species are typically drought-tolerant, with deep root systems that allow them to survive in harsh, dry environments. They play an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Some species are also used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities.</p>
