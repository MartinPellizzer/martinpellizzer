The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its native habitat. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection.</p>
