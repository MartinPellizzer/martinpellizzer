                <h1>Adina polycephala</h1>
<p>Adina polycephala, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 3â€“6 meters and features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round, woody fruits. Adina polycephala thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional medicinal uses in local cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina polycephala has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, ranging in size from 2 to 6 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and slightly woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that splits open to release one or two seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their small size and light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina polycephala is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, particularly in botanical gardens and greenhouses. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or along riverbanks. Adina polycephala typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, although its natural habitat faces threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adina polycephala is a hardy, fast-growing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions, commonly used for erosion control and ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings showing the highest success rate when rooted in a moist, well-draining medium. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, reaching maturity within 1-2 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It requires well-drained soil and regular watering, especially during dry periods, but is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in spring and pruning to maintain shape and encourage branching are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or root rot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with legumes or grasses can enhance its growth and soil stability.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adina polycephala is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species in mixed plantings. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Adina polycephala contributes to nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants in its vicinity.</p>
