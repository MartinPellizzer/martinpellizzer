<p>Adenia palmata, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, woody, fleshy fruits. Adenia palmata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its name derives from the milky sap it exudes, which is a notable botanical feature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia palmata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 10 to 20 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellowish-green petals and a prominent red stamen, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains several seeds, dispersed primarily by animals that eat the fruit.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia palmata is a flowering plant native to the eastern regions of Africa, particularly found in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more widespread, its current distribution is fragmented due to habitat loss and degradation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and mountainous areas, often growing along stream banks or in forest understories. Adenia palmata is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is classified as a vulnerable species in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenia palmata is a striking climbing plant native to Africa, known for its vibrant flowers and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant follows a seasonal growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid climates and flowering in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during its active growing season. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and pruning to control its size and shape are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>
