                    <h1>Austrobryonia pilbarensis</h1>
<p>Austrobryonia pilbarensis, commonly known as the Pilbara liverwort, is a rare and specialized liverwort species found in the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marchantiaceae and is characterized by its small, leafy thalloid structure. The plant thrives in rocky outcrops and sandstone formations, where it forms dense mats on the surface. Its survival depends on specific microclimatic conditions, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable indicator of habitat integrity in the Pilbara region.</p>
