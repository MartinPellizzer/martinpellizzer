<p>Anthericum capitatum, commonly known as the clustered adder's tongue, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces a dense cluster of small, white or pale green flowers at the center of the rosette, which bloom in late spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Anthericum capitatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering display.</p>
