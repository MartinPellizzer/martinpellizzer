                        <h1>Acacia greggii var. wrightii</h1>
<p>Acacia greggii var. wrightii, commonly known as the desert whitetop, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, feathery leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
