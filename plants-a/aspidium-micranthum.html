<p>Aspidium micranthum, commonly known as the small-fruited water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20â€“40 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in stream banks and wetlands. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Aspidium micranthum plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
