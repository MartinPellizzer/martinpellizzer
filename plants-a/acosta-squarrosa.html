                <h1>Acosta squarrosa</h1>
<p>Acosta squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and plant enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta squarrosa has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green color and a hairy texture on the upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits a creeping growth pattern with erect branches. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta squarrosa is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, particularly in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and mountainous areas. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with rocky outcrops and open slopes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the unique ecological conditions of the Andes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta squarrosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along trails.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban landscapes. The plant spreads primarily through its prolific seed production and ability to establish itself in nutrient-poor environments. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities in invaded areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is now considered an invasive species in several regions outside its native range.</p>
