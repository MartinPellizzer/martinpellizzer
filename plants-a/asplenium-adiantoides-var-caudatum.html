<p>Asplenium adiantoides var. caudatum, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble feathers.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of root hairs, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a graceful, arching growth habit that contributes to its ornamental appeal.</p>
