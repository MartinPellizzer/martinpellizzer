<p>Astragalus decurrens, commonly known as the trailing milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, and it has slender, trailing stems that help it spread across the ground. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it is adapted to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Astragalus decurrens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for various pollinators and herbivores.</p>
