                    <h1>Acanthophora</h1>
<p>Acanthophora, commonly known as the thorny shield lichen, is a genus of lichens belonging to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose or foliose growth form and is often found on rock surfaces in temperate and tropical regions. The thallus of Acanthophora typically exhibits a dark, leathery texture with distinct, branched, thorn-like structures called rhizines. It forms symbiotic associations with various species of cyanobacteria and fungi, contributing to its ecological role in nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, Acanthophora is of interest to both lichenologists and ecological researchers.</p>
