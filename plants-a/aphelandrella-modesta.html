<p>Aphelandrella modesta, commonly known as the modest lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its flat, leaf-like thallus that is typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in a variety of habitats, including bark and rock surfaces. Aphelandrella modesta is often found in temperate regions and is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and widespread distribution make it an important indicator species in environmental assessments.</p>
