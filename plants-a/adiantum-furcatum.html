                <h1>Adiantum furcatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum furcatum, commonly known as the veined maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features intricate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark, a unique characteristic among ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced.</p>
<p>The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation and botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum furcatum has fern-like leaves that are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem, and typically measuring 15â€“30 cm in length, with a light green to bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and creeping, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows horizontally along the ground. It does not produce flowers; instead, it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. The plant lacks true fruits and seeds, relying on sporangia for reproduction.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum furcatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, humid environments. This fern thrives in moist, well-drained soils, typically along stream banks or in forest undergrowth. Its distribution extends to parts of India and the Philippines as well.</p>
<p>It is an ornamental plant appreciated for its delicate, feathery fronds.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum furcatum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it suitable for temperate climates. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental species due to its delicate, lace-like fronds. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
