                    <h1>Anacheilium aemulum</h1>
<p>Anacheilium aemulum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender roots that anchor it to tree trunks and branches, and its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like. Its flowers are pale green or white, with a distinctive, elongated shape that sets it apart from other orchid species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
