<p>Azorella incisa, commonly known as the Antarctic haircap, is a perennial cushion plant native to the cold, arid regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing structure composed of tightly packed, fibrous leaves that form a compact mat. The plant is adapted to extreme environmental conditions, including strong winds, intense sunlight, and nutrient-poor soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically white or pale green and appear in early spring.</p>
<p>Azorella incisa plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its harsh habitat.</p>
