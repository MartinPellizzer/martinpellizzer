                <h1>Acinos acutifolius</h1>
<p>Acinos acutifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acino, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, showcasing its resilience to harsh conditions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos acutifolius has leaves that are narrow, linear to lanceolate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length. The stem is upright, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color. The flowers are small, white to pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos acutifolius is primarily native to the Iberian Peninsula, including parts of Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with Mediterranean climate conditions, such as southern Spain and northern Portugal. This plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often seen in open habitats like hillsides and slopes. It is particularly adapted to dry, sunny environments with low moisture availability.</p>
<p>Acinos acutifolius is also occasionally found in other parts of southern Europe, but its main range remains concentrated in the Iberian Peninsula.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos acutifolius was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is often found in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and cliffs. The plant is well adapted to arid conditions and can thrive in poor soils. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain areas.</p>
