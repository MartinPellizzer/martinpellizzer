<p>Althenia filiformis subsp.</p>
<p>betpakdalensis, commonly known as the Betpakdal althenia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Central Asian region. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like stems and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in mountainous areas with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
