                <h1>Acyntha patens</h1>
<p>Acyntha patens, commonly known as the spreading acynthus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Acyntha patens is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along coastal areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acyntha patens has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows in a sprawling or ascending manner. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in umbels, typically appearing in shades of purple or blue during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha patens is primarily native to parts of southern Europe, including Spain, Portugal, and southern France.</p>
<p>It is also found in North Africa, particularly in countries such as Morocco and Algeria. This plant grows in rocky and arid environments, often on slopes and in scrublands. It is adapted to dry climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the Mediterranean region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha patens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to low rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in temperate climates across Europe and parts of Asia. Its spread is often associated with human activity, including agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
