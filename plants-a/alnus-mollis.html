                    <h1>Alnus mollis</h1>
<p>Alnus mollis, commonly known as the softwood alder, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are male and female, with the female catkins developing into woody, cone-like structures. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges.</p>
<p>Alnus mollis plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, supporting diverse plant and animal life.</p>
