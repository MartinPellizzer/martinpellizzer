                <h1>Acacia farnesiana var. pedunculata</h1>
<p>Acacia farnesiana var. pedunculata, commonly known as the sweet acacia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2–5 meters. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a distinctive, fragrant scent.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to dry climates and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia farnesiana var. pedunculata has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, feather-like leaflets arranged in pairs along the stems, giving the plant a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are green, with a smooth surface, and they are typically 10–20 cm long. The stem is woody, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth when young but becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are yellow and consist of a dense spike of small, globular heads, blooming in spring and summer, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a legume pod containing small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia farnesiana var. pedunculata is a variant of the common acacia that is native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It has been introduced to various parts of the world, including the United States, Australia, and South America, where it often thrives in disturbed soils and urban environments. This plant typically grows in dry, sunny areas such as rocky slopes, coastal regions, and open woodlands, often at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 1,000 meters. Due to its adaptability and potential for invasiveness, it is considered a weed in some regions and is monitored for its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is generally stable, but local populations may be affected by habitat loss and competition with native species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia farnesiana var. pedunculata is a fast-growing shrub known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few years, making it ideal for quick landscape enhancement.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or root rot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or sage can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia farnesiana var. pedunculata is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich flowers. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and benefiting surrounding vegetation. It also serves as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing biodiversity and crop productivity.</p>
