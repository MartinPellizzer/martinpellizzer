                <h1>Acrospelion fuscum</h1>
<p>Acrospelion fuscum, commonly known as the brown spiny scale.</p>
<p>This plant is a species of scale insect that lacks a traditional plant structure, as it is a hemipteran insect rather than a flowering plant. It is often found on the stems and leaves of various host plants, where it feeds on plant sap. The adult form is typically small, with a dark brown, spiny appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its insect nature, it does not have botanical features like roots, stems, or leaves in the traditional sense.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrospelion fuscum has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows in a creeping habit. The flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pale yellow petals and a distinctive tubular structure, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>
