                    <h1>Acacia tenax</h1>
<p>Acacia tenax, commonly known as the rigid acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are followed by woody pods containing seeds. Acacia tenax is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and firewood.</p>
