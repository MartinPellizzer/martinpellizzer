                        <h1>Acacia tenax</h1>
<p>Acacia tenax, commonly known as the rigid acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are followed by woody pods containing seeds. Acacia tenax is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and firewood.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia tenax is primarily native to parts of southern Africa, including South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in savannas and rocky outcrops. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with shrublands and grasslands. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various animals.</p>
<p>Acacia tenax is also known for its hardy nature, making it adaptable to harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia tenax was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and provide habitat in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions where it forms dense thickets. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it valuable for land rehabilitation projects.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
