<p>Araiostegia membranulosa, commonly known as the membranous liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leafy structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a thalloid body, which is a flat, ribbon-like structure covered in tiny, green lobes. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Araiostegia membranulosa is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and habitat conditions due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
