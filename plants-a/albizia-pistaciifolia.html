                <h1>Albizia pistaciifolia</h1>
<p>Albizia pistaciifolia, commonly known as the Chinese honeylocust, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and resemble the shape of a pistachio nut, hence its specific epithet. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria. Albizia pistaciifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its seeds contain a toxic compound called rotenone, which has been historically used as a natural pesticide.</p>
