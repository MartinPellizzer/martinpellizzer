<p>Adamanthus tutae, commonly known as the Florida hickory, is a rare and endemic species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are followed by edible nuts enclosed in a husk. Adamanthus tutae is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters, with a slow growth rate and a long lifespan.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range.</p>
