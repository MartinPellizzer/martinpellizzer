                <h1>Adamanthus tutae</h1>
<p>Adamanthus tutae, commonly known as the Florida hickory, is a rare and endemic species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are followed by edible nuts enclosed in a husk. Adamanthus tutae is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters, with a slow growth rate and a long lifespan.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adamanthus tutae has leaves that are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in sandy soils and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus tutae is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This plant thrives in areas with consistently moist soil and high humidity. It is an important component of the native flora in these regions, contributing to the ecological balance.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often associated with areas that have a subtropical climate.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus tutae was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a temperate climate, particularly in the southeastern United States. This plant thrives in open woodlands and along stream banks where it can access adequate water and nutrients. Its introduction has been noted in several botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in various landscapes across its range.</p>
