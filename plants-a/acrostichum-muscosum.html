                <h1>Acrostichum muscosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum muscosum, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to the wet tropics of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain through its fronds. Its unique structure allows it to thrive on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in humid environments.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the underside of the fronds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum muscosum has large, broad, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a waxy, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is stout and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in dense clusters. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are tiny and numerous.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and colonize moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum muscosum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, lowland areas such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. This fern thrives in humid environments with rich, organic soil, often growing in dense vegetation. Its distribution extends to parts of the Caribbean and the southern United States, including Florida.</p>
<p>It is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum muscosum was mainly introduced to wetland areas and disturbed sites across the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, ditches, and along stream banks. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It spreads through rhizomes and can form dense mats that alter local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on biodiversity.</p>
