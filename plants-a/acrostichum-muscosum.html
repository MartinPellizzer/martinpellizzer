                    <h1>Acrostichum muscosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum muscosum, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to the wet tropics of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain through its fronds. Its unique structure allows it to thrive on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in humid environments.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
