                        <h1>Acetosella pachyphylla</h1>
<p>Acetosella pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, giving them a sour taste and making them suitable for use in culinary applications.</p>
<p>Acetosella pachyphylla thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
