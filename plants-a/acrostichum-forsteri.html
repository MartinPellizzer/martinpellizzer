<p>Acrostichum forsteri, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a large, terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its long, arching fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, underground stem that supports its massive foliage. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Acrostichum forsteri thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands.</p>
