                    <h1>Aristida submucronata var. scabra</h1>
<p>Aristida submucronata var. scabra, commonly known as rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly rough to the touch, contributing to its common name. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its tolerance to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
