                        <h1>Acantholimon acanthobryum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon acanthobryum, commonly known as the woolly stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial species belonging to the family Montiaceae, characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon acanthobryum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and their close relatives, characterized by their complex cellular structures and the presence of chlorophyll. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses ferns, horsetails, and their relatives, known for their vascular systems and often retaining primitive features. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many primitive angiosperms, often with showy flowers and a variety of reproductive strategies.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants with distinctive flower structures and often contains species adapted to arid environments. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly found in arid and coastal regions, known for their often blue or purple flowers and specialized adaptations to saline soils. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid and mountainous regions, characterized by their succulent leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon acanthobryum, a specific plant within the genus Acantholimon, known for its distinctive morphology and ecological adaptations to harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon acanthobryum is primarily native to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central areas. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at higher altitudes. It is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates typical of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Afghanistan.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon acanthobryum was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure, often found in mountainous or coastal areas. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed sites such as roadsides, construction areas, and quarries. Its introduction has been documented in several regions across the Mediterranean and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it can spread rapidly and may become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
