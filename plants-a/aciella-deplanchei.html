                <h1>Aciella deplanchei</h1>
<p>Aciella deplanchei, commonly known as the Mexican sunflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and other composite flowers. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow to orange ray florets and dark褐色 disk florets. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands.</p>
<p>Aciella deplanchei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciella deplanchei has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and arranged in clusters, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciella deplanchei is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas within the Andes mountain range. This plant thrives in temperate to cold climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with alpine environments and can be found at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciella deplanchei was mainly introduced to regions with warm, dry climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental value. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes in gardens and public spaces.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
