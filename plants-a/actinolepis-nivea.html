                <h1>Actinolepis nivea</h1>
<p>Actinolepis nivea, commonly known as the white-stemmed fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, light green fronds that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the substrate.</p>
<p>Actinolepis nivea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinolepis nivea has narrow, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-white underside and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rough and fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinolepis nivea is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. This plant thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and is often associated with mixed hardwood forests. It is most prevalent in states such as Tennessee, Virginia, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinolepis nivea was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive white flowers and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often along stream banks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
