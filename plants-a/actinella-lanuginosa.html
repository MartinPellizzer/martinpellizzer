                <h1>Actinella lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Actinella lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly actinella, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks.</p>
<p>Actinella lanuginosa produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella lanuginosa has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, bluish-green upper surface and a fuzzy, pale underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in fine, soft hairs, and has a light greenish-gray bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella lanuginosa is primarily native to the Pacific Northwest region of North America, including parts of Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This plant thrives in cool, humid climates and is often associated with coniferous and mixed woodlands. Its distribution includes areas with well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ericaceae family, known for its ability to tolerate nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella lanuginosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest margins. It has since spread widely across the country, often outcompeting native species.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
