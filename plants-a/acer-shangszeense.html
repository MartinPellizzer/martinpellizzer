                <h1>Acer shangszeense</h1>
<p>Acer shangszeense, commonly known as the Sichuan maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and has a rounded crown with smooth, gray bark. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer shangszeense has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree with a rounded crown. The flowers are inconspicuous, greenish-yellow in color, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early spring, with wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, providing stability and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer shangszeense is a rare species of maple native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Tibet, China.</p>
<p>Its native range is primarily confined to the eastern part of the Himalayas, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Currently, the plant is distributed in limited areas, mainly in the valleys and slopes of the Tibetan Plateau. It typically grows at altitudes between 2,500 and 3,500 meters, in temperate forests with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer shangszeense is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer shangszeense is a rare and ornamental maple tree native to China, known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique growth characteristics.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer shangszeense involves a slow initial growth phase followed by steady development, typically reaching maturity within 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer shangszeense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting the reproductive cycles of other plants in the ecosystem. It acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through microclimate regulation. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, helping to mitigate climate change impacts in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer shangszeense is a rare species of maple native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial and economic terms, it contributes to local biodiversity and may support eco-tourism in its native habitat. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in traditional Chinese botany and may be used in ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>However, due to its limited distribution and conservation status, its applications remain largely restricted to ecological and scientific research.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer shangszeense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aconitifolium' and 'Cunninghamii', which are known for their striking foliage and compact growth habits. Hybrid forms have been developed to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and fall color, making them more adaptable to various climates. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in different garden settings.</p>
<p>Their unique characteristics have made them a sought-after addition to both public and private landscapes.</p>
