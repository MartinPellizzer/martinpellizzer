<p>Acer shangszeense, commonly known as the Sichuan maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and prefers well-drained soils in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
