                <h1>Acer shangszeense</h1>
<p>Acer shangszeense, commonly known as the Sichuan maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters and prefers well-drained soils in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer shangszeense has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a pointed tip and serrated edges, typically measuring 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, turning red or orange in autumn. The stem is smooth and slender, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a spreading crown. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins during spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruits are samaras, each with a single seed enclosed in a winged structure, dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer shangszeense is a rare species of maple native to China, specifically found in the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations in the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It thrives in temperate environments with high humidity and well-drained soils. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Acer shangszeense is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer shangszeense is a rare and ornamental maple species native to China, known for its unique foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer shangszeense is slow, with new growth appearing in spring and foliage turning vibrant colors in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning should be done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving plants like ferns or hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer shangszeense is a deciduous tree native to China that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil structure and supporting other plant life. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil and prevents runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer shangszeense contributes to carbon sequestration, helping to mitigate climate change impacts in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer shangszeense is a rare species of maple native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In terms of industrial and economic value, it contributes to local biodiversity and may support sustainable forestry practices. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and natural beauty, often inspiring art and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, further research is needed to fully understand its broader applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer shangszeense has several varieties and cultivars that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Shangze' and 'Crimson Queen,' which are known for their striking autumn foliage. Hybrids of Acer shangszeense are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and color display. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Their unique characteristics make them a desirable addition to botanical collections and urban green spaces.</p>
