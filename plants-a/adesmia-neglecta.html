                <h1>Adesmia neglecta</h1>
<p>Adesmia neglecta, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. Its milky sap, which is characteristic of the milkweed genus, contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Adesmia neglecta plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as widely cultivated as other milkweed species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia neglecta has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia neglecta is primarily native to Argentina South.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of Argentina, particularly in the Patagonian area. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of the region with its drought-resistant features.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Argentina's southern provinces.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia neglecta was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as trade, gardening, and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides, indicating its adaptability to various conditions. The plant's spread is often associated with its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor areas. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native flora and ecosystem balance.</p>
