                    <h1>Adesmia neglecta</h1>
<p>Adesmia neglecta, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. Its milky sap, which is characteristic of the milkweed genus, contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Adesmia neglecta plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as widely cultivated as other milkweed species.</p>
