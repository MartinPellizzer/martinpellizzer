                <h1>Adiantum urbanianum</h1>
<p>Adiantum urbanianum, commonly known as the eastern maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is native to eastern North America, particularly in forested areas. The plant features bipinnate leaves that are finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Adiantum urbanianum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum urbanianum has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, feather-shaped, and arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a delicate, light green color and a size ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a light brown color and a growth pattern that is typically clumping or creeping. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum urbanianum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in humid lowland forests. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often associated with forest undergrowth. It is also present in some parts of India and the Pacific islands.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes riverbanks, wetlands, and rocky areas with high humidity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum urbanianum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as stream banks and forest floors. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites and has become naturalized in several locations. Its spread has been facilitated by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to partial shade.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in most of its introduced range.</p>
