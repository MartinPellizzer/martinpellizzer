<p>Anulocaulis leiosolenus var. gypsogenus, commonly known as the gypsum anulocaulis, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in arid, calcareous environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, succulent-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, fleshy leaves that reduce water loss, and its flowers are typically small and clustered. It is often found in gypsum soils, where it forms dense mats or low-growing rosettes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of arid and semi-arid ecosystems.</p>
