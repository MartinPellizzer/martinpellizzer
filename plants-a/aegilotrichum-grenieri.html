                <h1>Aegilotrichum grenieri</h1>
<p>Aegilotrichum grenieri, commonly known as the Grenier's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>Aegilotrichum grenieri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilotrichum grenieri has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when the pod dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>
