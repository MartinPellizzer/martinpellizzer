                <h1>Adiantum kohautianum</h1>
<p>Adiantum kohautianum, commonly known as the Kohaut's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, feathery appearance, with a pale, often silvery underside.</p>
<p>Adiantum kohautianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum kohautianum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lacey appearance, and they are typically arranged in a bipinnate pattern along the stems.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a bright green color, with a slender and elongated shape, and they can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a clumping pattern. This plant does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-bearing plant rather than a flowering plant.</p>
<p>Its roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum kohautianum is primarily native to the humid forests of Central America, particularly in countries such as Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments within the understory of tropical rainforests. This fern is commonly found in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 800 to 2,000 meters above sea level. It plays an important ecological role by contributing to the biodiversity of these forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum kohautianum was mainly introduced to new environments due to its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with moist, shaded conditions, often near streams or in forested areas. This plant has been cultivated in gardens and greenhouses worldwide, particularly in temperate climates. Its introduction has sometimes led to naturalization in areas outside its native range.</p>
<p>Careful management is recommended to prevent it from becoming invasive in local ecosystems.</p>
