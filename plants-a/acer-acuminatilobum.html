<p>Acer acuminatilobum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely toothed leaves that display a range of colors throughout the growing season.

This species is commonly associated with mixed evergreen and deciduous forests, growing in shaded or semi-shaded conditions. It is also occasionally found in parts of northern Vietnam and northern Myanmar.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer acuminatilobum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental tree due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf shape.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas across the eastern and central regions of the country.
