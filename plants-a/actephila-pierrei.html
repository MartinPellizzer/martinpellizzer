                <h1>Actephila pierrei</h1>
<p>Actephila pierrei, commonly known as the Hawaiian rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and upland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Actephila pierrei is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila pierrei has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered with a rough, bark-like texture, and has a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind once it opens.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila pierrei is primarily native to Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This species typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and mountainous areas. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in Vietnam.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila pierrei was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It was first discovered in the early 20th century and has since spread across several islands. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental transport via human activity.</p>
<p>Currently, it is considered a non-native species with limited impact on local ecosystems.</p>
