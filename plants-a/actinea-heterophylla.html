                <h1>Actinea heterophylla</h1>
<p>Actinea heterophylla, commonly known as the variable actinia, is a unique marine invertebrate belonging to the family Actiniidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flexible, elongated body and a crown of tentacles used for capturing prey. The plant exhibits a wide range of morphological variations, with differences in color, size, and shape of its polyps. It thrives in shallow coastal waters and is often found in rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, Actinea heterophylla plays an important role in marine ecosystems as both predator and prey.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea heterophylla has leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant ages. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and attracting pollinators such as bees through nectar. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight, feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea heterophylla is primarily native to eastern North America, specifically the eastern United States and parts of southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands, stream banks, and forest floors. The plant thrives in areas with rich, organic soil and is often associated with mixed hardwood forests. It is particularly common in the Appalachian region and extends into the southeastern states.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific habitats, its distribution is relatively localized within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea heterophylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1960s and has since spread across various regions of the country. The plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, farmland, and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in different soil types have contributed to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed and may compete with native plant species.</p>
