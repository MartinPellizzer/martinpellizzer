                <h1>Adisca subpeltata</h1>
<p>Adisca subpeltata, commonly known as the Cape mountain heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Adisca subpeltata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in coastal conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adisca subpeltata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanging as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adisca subpeltata is primarily native to South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape Province.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and rocky habitats within this region. The plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high rainfall. It is often associated with coastal and mountainous regions of the Eastern Cape.</p>
<p>Adisca subpeltata is a rare and endemic species, known for its distinctive yellow flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adisca subpeltata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The introduction occurred in the late 19th century through horticultural trade. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in native forests and along streambanks.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential environmental weed due to its ability to thrive in a variety of habitats.</p>
