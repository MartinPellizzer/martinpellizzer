                <h1>Abelia uniflora</h1>
<p>Abelia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower abelia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy green. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of pink and white during late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens.</p>
<p>Abelia uniflora is also valued for its attractive fall foliage, which turns red or orange.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelia uniflora has ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long, arranged oppositely along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>Its stems are slender, reddish-brown, and slightly hairy, growing in a spreading or upright manner depending on the cultivar. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, helping it thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelia uniflora is a flowering shrub native to the southeastern United States, specifically found in parts of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it is now cultivated and naturalized in various regions across the United States and parts of Europe. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, often growing in woodland edges or along stream banks. It typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, usually below 300 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as threatened, its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and invasive species competition.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abelia uniflora is a hardy, flowering shrub known for its fragrant white blooms and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings in spring or by seeds, though cuttings yield more reliable results. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 2-3 years, with blooming occurring in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize with a balanced fertilizer in early spring, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or roses can enhance its ornamental appeal and improve garden biodiversity.</p>
