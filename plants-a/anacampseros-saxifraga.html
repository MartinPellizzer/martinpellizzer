<p>Anacampseros saxifraga, commonly known as the stonecress, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, often blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss through evaporation.</p>
<p>Anacampseros saxifraga is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
