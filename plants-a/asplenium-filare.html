<p>Asplenium filare, commonly known as the narrow fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the undersides of its leaves. Asplenium filare prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing in rocky or wooded areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable species for studying fern morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
