                <h1>Abutilon hybridum</h1>
<p>Abutilon hybridum, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant in the mallow family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon hybridum has broad, ovate to heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and often hairy, with a light green to pale brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a bushy, upright manner. Its flowers are pendulous, bell-shaped, and come in shades of yellow or orange, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
