                    <h1>Agrostis × subaristata</h1>
<p>Agrostis × subaristata, commonly known as the hybrid meadow grass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis stolonifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, including coastal areas and sandy soils. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>However, due to its sterility, it does not produce seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
