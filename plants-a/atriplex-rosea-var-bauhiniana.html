<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, making it well adapted to dry environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
