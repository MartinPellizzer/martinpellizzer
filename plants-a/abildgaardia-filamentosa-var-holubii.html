<p>Abildgaardia filamentosa var. holubii, commonly known as the Holub's feather grass, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of many grass species. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
