                <h1>Adiantum capillaceum</h1>
<p>Adiantum capillaceum, commonly known as the hair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or near streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>Adiantum capillaceum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with the right humidity and light conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum capillaceum has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measuring about 10-20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is green in color, with a smooth texture and grows in a creeping or ascending manner. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves, and it does not have true flowers or a blooming period in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and these are dispersed by wind, with no distinct fruit or seed dispersal mechanism.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum capillaceum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of these regions. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments along forest floors and rocky outcrops. It is also known to occur in parts of the Philippines and New Guinea.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the lowland and montane forests of these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum capillaceum was mainly introduced to wetlands, stream banks, and shaded forest floors where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it suitable for both natural and cultivated settings. This fern is often used in landscaping for its delicate, lace-like fronds and ability to tolerate partial shade. Its introduction has expanded its habitat range, allowing it to grow in regions beyond its native distribution.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native areas.</p>
