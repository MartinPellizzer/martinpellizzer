                    <h1>Adiantum capillaceum</h1>
<p>Adiantum capillaceum, commonly known as the hair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or near streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>Adiantum capillaceum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with the right humidity and light conditions.</p>
