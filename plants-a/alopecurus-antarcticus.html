<p>Alopecurus antarcticus, commonly known as Antarctic hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in wet, temperate regions, often found in bogs and along the edges of lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its adaptations to cold environments include a compact growth form and the ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Alopecurus antarcticus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
