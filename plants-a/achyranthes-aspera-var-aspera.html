<p>Achyranthes aspera var. aspera, commonly known as prickly chervil, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by elongated, ribbed fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes aspera var. aspera has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough, serrated margin and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, somewhat woody at the base, with a reddish-brown bark that is smooth to slightly rough in texture. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pale green to reddish sepals and stamen, blooming from July to September, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, helping the plant anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
