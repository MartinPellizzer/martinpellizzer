                <h1>Actinella carnosa</h1>
<p>Actinella carnosa, commonly known as the woolly actinella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella carnosa has small, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that disperses its seeds through animal ingestion.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella carnosa is primarily native to the Pacific Northwest region of North America, including parts of Washington, Oregon, and northern California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest environments, often growing along stream banks and in rocky areas. This plant is particularly associated with the coastal and mountainous regions of the western United States. It thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Actinella carnosa is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella carnosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the introduction of the genus Actinella for horticultural purposes. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant ecological threat.</p>
