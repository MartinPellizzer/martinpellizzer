                    <h1>Andrachne phyllanthoides var. reverchonii</h1>
<p>Andrachne phyllanthoides var. reverchonii, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often forming dense colonies in disturbed or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well-suited for survival in drought conditions.</p>
