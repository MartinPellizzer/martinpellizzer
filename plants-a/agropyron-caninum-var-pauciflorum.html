                    <h1>Agropyron caninum var. pauciflorum</h1>
<p>Agropyron caninum var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear few flowers, hence its specific epithet "pauciflorum.". It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system makes it a valuable plant for soil stabilization and erosion control.</p>
