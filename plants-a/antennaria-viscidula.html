                    <h1>Antennaria viscidula</h1>
<p>Antennaria viscidula, commonly known as sticky willow or sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and tiny, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces sticky, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Antennaria viscidula plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
