<p>Aspidium macrophyllum var. pittieri, commonly known as the Pittieri's water fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed water fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in moist soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic habitats.</p>
