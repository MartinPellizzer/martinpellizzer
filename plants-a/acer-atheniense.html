<p>Acer atheniense, commonly known as the Athens maple, is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Greece.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered flowers followed by winged seeds, typical of the maple family. It prefers well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
