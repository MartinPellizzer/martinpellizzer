                        <h1>Acer atheniense</h1>
<p>Acer atheniense, commonly known as the Athens maple, is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Greece.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered flowers followed by winged seeds, typical of the maple family. It prefers well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer atheniense is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, including parts of Italy, Greece, and the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with mild, temperate climates and well-drained soils. This species thrives in elevations ranging from 600 to 2,000 meters above sea level. It is often associated with mixed forests and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of Turkey and the western Caucasus as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer atheniense was mainly introduced to urban and suburban areas in the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in parks, gardens, and along streets due to its ornamental value and adaptability to human-altered environments. This species has been widely cultivated for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some regions, where it can sometimes compete with native plant species.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a non-invasive species in its introduced range.</p>
