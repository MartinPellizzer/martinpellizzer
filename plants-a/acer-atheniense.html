                <h1>Acer atheniense</h1>
<p>Acer atheniense, commonly known as the Athens maple, is a species of maple native to the forests of Greece.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven pointed lobes, and turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the autumn. It produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer atheniense has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a bright green color during the growing season and turning red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and has a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its natural habitat in rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer atheniense is a rare and striking maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>While it was once found in Greece, its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range in China. It thrives in cool, humid environments, typically growing in shaded forest understories. This species is commonly found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer atheniense is classified as critically endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer atheniense is a unique maple tree known for its striking red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period to germinate successfully. The growth cycle of Acer atheniense includes a dormant phase in winter, active growth in spring, and a period of foliage color change in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-tolerant plants like ferns or hostas can enhance its garden aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer atheniense is a small, ornamental tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, yellow flowers. The tree acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the aesthetic value of the landscape. Its deep root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological benefits of urban environments by improving air quality and providing shade.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer atheniense is a species of maple known for its ornamental value and historical significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to horticulture and landscape design, particularly in urban settings. Culturally, it holds symbolic meaning in certain regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems also supports biodiversity and environmental stability.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer atheniense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson Sentinel' and 'Aureum', known for their vibrant foliage and unique growth habits. The species has been hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, to create cultivars with enhanced coloration and hardiness. These hybrids and cultivars are important in horticulture for their ability to thrive in various climates and their aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to their visual impact and adaptability, Acer atheniense and its related cultivars hold significant horticultural importance in the ornamental plant trade.</p>
