                        <h1>Acaena glaucella</h1>
<p>Acaena glaucella, commonly known as the silver burr, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny, burr-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate and have a distinctive wavy margin, while its stems are often prostrate or ascending.</p>
<p>Acaena glaucella is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena glaucella is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is adapted to the temperate climate and well-drained soils of these regions.</p>
<p>Acaena glaucella is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food and habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena glaucella was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
