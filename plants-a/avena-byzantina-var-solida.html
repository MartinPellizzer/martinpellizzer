                    <h1>Avena byzantina var. solida</h1>
<p>Avena byzantina var. solida, commonly known as the hardstem oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are encased in a tough, fibrous hull, which contributes to its resilience in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
