                <h1>Adenophora turczaninowii</h1>
<p>Adenophora turczaninowii, commonly known as the Korean bellflower, is a perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountain slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish in color.</p>
<p>Adenophora turczaninowii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora turczaninowii has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically hairy and range in size from 2 to 6 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are usually erect, somewhat hairy, and have a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clump or spreading habit. Its flowers are bell-shaped, arranged in clusters, and range in color from pale blue to purple, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor itself and spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora turczaninowii is primarily native to the temperate regions of East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous areas and forested regions where the climate is cool and moist. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or gravelly habitats. It is particularly common in the northeastern part of China, such as in the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning.</p>
<p>Adenophora turczaninowii is also present in the Korean Peninsula and parts of southern Japan, where it grows in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora turczaninowii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers. The species has since spread beyond cultivation and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to establish itself in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently classified as a major invasive species in New Zealand.</p>
