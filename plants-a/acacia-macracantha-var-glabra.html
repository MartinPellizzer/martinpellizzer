<p>Acacia macracantha var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and phyllodes that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads in late summer to early autumn, which are highly attractive to birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along coastal areas.</p>
<p>The smooth wattle is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest.</p>
