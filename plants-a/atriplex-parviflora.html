                    <h1>Atriplex parviflora</h1>
<p>Atriplex parviflora, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its root system is extensive, helping it to access deep water sources and stabilize sandy soils.</p>
<p>Atriplex parviflora is also valued for its ability to tolerate heavy metals, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts.</p>
