                        <h1>Acacia westonii</h1>
<p>Acacia westonii, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia westonii is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of firewood.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia westonii is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. This species thrives in coastal and inland areas, often in sandy or rocky soils. It is commonly associated with fynbos vegetation, which is characteristic of the region's Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>Acacia westonii is well adapted to the dry, sunny conditions typical of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia westonii was mainly introduced to areas with a warm, dry climate and well-drained soils, typically found in regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savannas and rocky outcrops where it thrives in full sun. The plant is often used for soil stabilization due to its deep root system and ability to tolerate drought conditions. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world as an ornamental plant because of its unique foliage and resilience.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
