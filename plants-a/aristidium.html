                    <h1>Aristidium</h1>
<p>Aristidium, commonly known as false brome, is a genus of grasses native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>These plants typically grow in open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. They are characterized by their slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Aristidium species are often used in ecological restoration due to their ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are important in both natural and cultivated landscapes.</p>
