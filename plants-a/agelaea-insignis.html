<p>Agelaea insignis, commonly known as the golden spike fern, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow spore-bearing structures called sori. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are elongated and feathery, with a vibrant green color that contrasts beautifully with its golden sori.</p>
<p>Agelaea insignis is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in tropical ecosystems.</p>
