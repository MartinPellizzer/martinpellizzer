                        <h1>Acaena fissistipula var. brevibracteata</h1>
<p>Acaena fissistipula var. brevibracteata, commonly known as the short-bracted New Zealand spinach, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, spiny fruits and compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of woody, follicle-like fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental or for its edible leaves.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena fissistipula var. brevibracteata is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions of the Southern Alps. This variety grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often on rocky or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with open vegetation types such as tussock grasslands and heathlands.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena fissistipula var. brevibracteata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus for ornamental purposes. This variant is typically found in coastal and lowland areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, often growing along roadsides and in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited compared to other Acaena species in the region.</p>
