<p>Acrostichum acrocarpon, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a large, tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, underground stem that supports its extensive foliage. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving them a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests.</p>
