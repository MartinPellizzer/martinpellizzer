<p>Asraoa triandra, commonly known as the Malabar mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody fruits containing several seeds. Asraoa triandra is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and construction.</p>
