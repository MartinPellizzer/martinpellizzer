<p>Abies rubra, commonly known as the red spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly twisted. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Red spruce typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its bark is thin and reddish-brown, becoming thicker and more furrowed with age.</p>
