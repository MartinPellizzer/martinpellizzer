                <h1>Actinotus periculosus</h1>
<p>Actinotus periculosus, commonly known as the dangerous actinotus, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like inflorescence. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers. It is known for its toxic properties, containing compounds that can cause severe reactions in humans and animals.</p>
<p>Despite its dangerous nature, it plays an important role in the ecological systems of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinotus periculosus has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age. Its flowers are delicate, white or pale pink, with five petal-like lobes, and bloom in late spring to early summer, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus periculosus is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern and southern regions of the state. This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with open woodland and heathland environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Queensland's coastal and inland regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus periculosus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads rapidly through its rhizomes.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
