                <h1>Acer cinerascens</h1>
<p>Acer cinerascens, commonly known as the smoke maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, feathery leaves that turn a striking red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full to partial sunlight.</p>
<p>The smoke maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer cinerascens has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a finely serrated margin and a dark green upper surface that turns red or purple in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with a simple structure consisting of five petals, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cinerascens is a species of maple native to the highland regions of Central America, specifically found in countries such as Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including some areas of the southern United States. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils, often growing in mountainous or forested areas. This species is typically found at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer cinerascens is considered vulnerable, though it remains relatively stable in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer cinerascens is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer cinerascens involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with other shade-tolerant plants in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer cinerascens is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and supporting a diverse range of flora. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer cinerascens offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for a wide array of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer cinerascens is a species of maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
