<p>Arenaria gayana, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in spring and early summer. Its succulent leaves are often covered in fine hairs, providing additional protection against desiccation.</p>
<p>Arenaria gayana is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes.</p>
