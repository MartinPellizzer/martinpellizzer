                <h1>Aeluropus mesopotamicus</h1>
<p>Aeluropus mesopotamicus, commonly known as the Mesopotamian saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand saline and drought conditions. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal and inland salt marshes.</p>
<p>Aeluropus mesopotamicus plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus mesopotamicus has narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat, linear, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length and having a gray-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green to brownish color, growing in dense clumps or mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, with a greenish color and a wind pollination method, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in sandy or saline soils and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>
