                <h1>Aconitum rotundifolium</h1>
<p>Aconitum rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are rounded and palmately lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is part of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its toxic compounds, including potent alkaloids. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum rotundifolium has round or heart-shaped leaves that are usually large, broad, and deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, usually smooth and somewhat woody, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with spurred petals and a complex structure, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum rotundifolium is primarily native to Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kirgizstan, Nepal, Pakistan, Tadzhikistan, West Himalaya, and Xinjiang.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing at high elevations. The species is commonly associated with rocky soils and forested areas.</p>
<p>Its native range spans across parts of Central and South Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum rotundifolium was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its striking purple flowers and unique foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in wetlands and riparian areas. Its rapid spread has raised concerns among ecologists and land managers.</p>
<p>Efforts are now underway to control its population and prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
