<p>Anthericum longistylum, commonly known as the long-stemmed nettle or false nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and a central stem that bears clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in dense inflorescences, which are typically concealed within leaf-like bracts. Its leaves contain stinging hairs, similar to true nettles, which can cause a mild irritation upon contact.</p>
<p>Anthericum longistylum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
