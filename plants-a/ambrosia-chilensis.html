<p>Ambrosia chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean ambrosia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow to brown flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Ambrosia chilensis is also known for its ability to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it a resilient species in coastal and semi-arid regions.</p>
