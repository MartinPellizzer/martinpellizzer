                        <h1>Abelia anhwensis</h1>
<p>Abelia anhwensis, commonly known as the Chinese abelia, is a deciduous shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Abelia anhwensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelia anhwensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of western China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with cool, moist conditions and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant is adapted to well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a common sight in the understory of mixed deciduous and evergreen forests. It is also occasionally found in rocky slopes and streamside habitats within its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological niche, Abelia anhwensis is considered a relatively rare and localized species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelia anhwensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. The distribution includes areas in Oregon and Washington where it has been cultivated in gardens and landscapes. However, it is not considered invasive in these regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has contributed to the biodiversity of native plant communities in the area.</p>
