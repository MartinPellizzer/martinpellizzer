                    <h1>Atriplex leptocarpa f. turbinata</h1>
<p>Atriplex leptocarpa f. turbinata, commonly known as the Turbinated Saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, often prostrate growth habit and small, orbicular to elliptic leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, salt-excreting hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves and stems are succulent, allowing it to store water and tolerate saline soils.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects in dryland areas.</p>
