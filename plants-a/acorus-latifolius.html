                <h1>Acorus latifolius</h1>
<p>Acorus latifolius, commonly known as broadleaf sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshes in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive yellowish-green coloration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like clusters. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
<p>Acorus latifolius is also valued for its aromatic properties and traditional medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus latifolius has broad, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often white or yellowish underside.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem with a smooth, light brown bark that grows horizontally underground. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spikes during the spring, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spathate, containing numerous minute seeds that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomes that spread horizontally, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus latifolius is primarily native to temperate and tropical regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Southeast Asia, such as India and Indonesia. This plant typically grows in wetland habitats, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. It is commonly associated with muddy or aquatic environments where it can thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Acorus latifolius is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus latifolius was mainly introduced to aquatic and wetland environments where it thrives in shallow, still water.</p>
<p>It is often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. This plant can spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it an aggressive colonizer in its introduced range. Its presence can alter water chemistry and outcompete native species for space and resources.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a nuisance in many regions where it has been introduced.</p>
