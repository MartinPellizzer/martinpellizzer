                    <h1>Astragalus pycnorrhizus</h1>
<p>Astragalus pycnorrhizus, commonly known as the dense-rooted milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and its ability to thrive in poor, sandy soils. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and hairy.</p>
<p>Astragalus pycnorrhizus plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
