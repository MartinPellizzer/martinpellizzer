                <h1>Aegiphila acutangula</h1>
<p>Aegiphila acutangula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pittosporum, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Aegiphila acutangula is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila acutangula has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its small, clustered flowers are pale pink or white, with tubular structures and five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, rocky environments where the plant typically grows.</p>
