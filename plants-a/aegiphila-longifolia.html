                <h1>Aegiphila longifolia</h1>
<p>Aegiphila longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically tubular and clustered in whorls, producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Aegiphila longifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila longifolia has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, featuring tubular structures adapted for pollination by insects, and they bloom during the spring and early summer. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
