                <h1>Adenochlaena leucocephala</h1>
<p>Adenochlaena leucocephala, commonly known as the white-headed adenochlaena, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance.</p>
<p>It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenochlaena leucocephala has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with five petals, blooming during the wet season, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenochlaena leucocephala is primarily native to Comoros, Madagascar.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical regions of these islands, where it thrives in humid and warm climates. It is commonly associated with forested areas and coastal environments. The plant is well adapted to the local soil and climatic conditions of the region.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific locations in the Indian Ocean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenochlaena leucocephala was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive white flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in coastal environments and can spread rapidly along sand dunes.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
