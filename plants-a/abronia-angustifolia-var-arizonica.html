                    <h1>Abronia angustifolia var. arizonica</h1>
<p>Abronia angustifolia var. arizonica, commonly known as Arizona sand veronica, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its geographic distribution and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Abronia angustifolia.</p>
