                <h1>Aegilops contracta</h1>
<p>Aegilops contracta, commonly known as the slender wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Aegilops contracta is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, arid environments.</p>
<p>It is considered a valuable forage plant for livestock in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops contracta has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a rough, fibrous texture and a light green to brownish color, growing in a clump-like formation. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to white florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed spikelet that contains three seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
