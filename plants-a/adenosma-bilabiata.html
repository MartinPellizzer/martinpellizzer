                <h1>Adenosma bilabiata</h1>
<p>Adenosma bilabiata, commonly known as the two-lipped adenosma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters. Its leaves are opposite and often have a rough texture.</p>
<p>Adenosma bilabiata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma bilabiata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in the plant's ability to absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma bilabiata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, shady environments. This species thrives in forest understories and along riverbanks, where it benefits from high humidity and partial sunlight. Its native range extends into parts of southern China and the Philippines as well.</p>
<p>Adenosma bilabiata is an important plant in local ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma bilabiata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Australia. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including agriculture and land clearing.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
