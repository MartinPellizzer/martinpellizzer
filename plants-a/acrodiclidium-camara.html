                <h1>Acrodiclidium camara</h1>
<p>Acrodiclidium camara, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Burseraceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and small, leathery leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, round fruits containing a single seed.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrodiclidium camara has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodiclidium camara is primarily native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in semi-desert environments. This plant is well adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. It often grows in open areas with minimal vegetation cover.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of well-drained soils and sufficient sunlight.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodiclidium camara was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with warm and humid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soil. This plant has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains relatively limited compared to other introduced species.</p>
