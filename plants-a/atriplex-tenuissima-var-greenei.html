                    <h1>Atriplex tenuissima var. greenei</h1>
<p>Atriplex tenuissima var. greenei, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This species is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh desert conditions.</p>
