                <h1>Acrostichum albescens</h1>
<p>Acrostichum albescens, commonly known as the white brake fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are typically light green to white in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swamps and along riverbanks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The white brake fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum albescens has large, elongated, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a bright green upper surface and a pale, almost white underside.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a spreading, clump-forming pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming during the late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a round, spiky capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish new growth.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum albescens is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in lowland areas with rich, well-drained soil. This plant is often associated with coastal and mangrove ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. It is also occasionally found in disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other tropical regions outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum albescens was mainly introduced to disturbed coastal areas and tidal flats.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often colonizing sites affected by erosion or human activity. This plant is commonly found in mangrove ecosystems where it competes with native species for space and resources. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a successful invader in coastal zones.</p>
<p>However, its introduction can lead to ecological imbalances by altering habitat structure and reducing biodiversity.</p>
