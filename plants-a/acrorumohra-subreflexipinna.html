                <h1>Acrorumohra subreflexipinna</h1>
<p>Acrorumohra subreflexipinna, commonly known as the reflexed pinna fern, is a species of fern characterized by its intricate fronds and specialized reproductive structures.</p>
<p>Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with secondary pinnae that curve back toward the stem, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It produces spores in spherical clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Acrorumohra subreflexipinna make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and evolutionary botany.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrorumohra subreflexipinna has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-white in color, consisting of five petals and stamens, and bloom during the spring season, primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
