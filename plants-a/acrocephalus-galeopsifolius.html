<p>Acrocephalus galeopsifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, ponds, and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a distinct midrib.</p>
<p>It produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland wildlife.</p>
