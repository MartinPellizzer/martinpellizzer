                <h1>Adiantum tenellum</h1>
<p>Adiantum tenellum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bi-pinnate fronds that resemble flowing hair, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive rachis that is slightly hairy.</p>
<p>Adiantum tenellum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in indoor conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum tenellum has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, bi-lobed, and arranged in a pinnate pattern, typically reaching up to 10 cm in length with a light green color.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, creeping, and often root at the nodes, with a smooth, pale green bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, which are wind-pollinated and consist of separate male and female parts. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the substrate.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum tenellum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, China, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in moist, shaded environments like forest floors and stream banks. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often associated with limestone areas due to its calcium-rich soil preferences. It is also present in parts of Australia and Indonesia, where it grows in similar ecological conditions.</p>
<p>Adiantum tenellum is a versatile species that can adapt to various microhabitats within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum tenellum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This fern is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate, lacy fronds. It has been reported to spread aggressively in certain areas, sometimes becoming invasive.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
