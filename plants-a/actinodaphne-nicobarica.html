                <h1>Actinodaphne nicobarica</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne nicobarica, commonly known as the Nicobar laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by elliptical, dark blue-black berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne nicobarica has elliptical or ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a pale grey bark that peels off in thin layers as the plant grows. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are unisexual, with greenish-white petals, and they bloom during the monsoon season, likely pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the moist, shaded understory of tropical forests.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne nicobarica is primarily native to the Nicobar Islands and parts of the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is also found in the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including the eastern coast of India and the Bay of Bengal. This plant typically grows in lowland evergreen forests and moist, shaded areas. It is commonly found in coastal and mountainous regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in warm and humid conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne nicobarica was mainly introduced to urban and suburban gardens in Southeast Asia for its ornamental value and aromatic leaves.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in countries such as India, Malaysia, and Indonesia due to its ability to thrive in tropical climates. The plant is often used in landscape design for its dense foliage and fragrance. However, it has also been reported to spread into natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasive nature.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to increased research on its ecological impact and management strategies.</p>
