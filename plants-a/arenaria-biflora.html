<p>Arenaria biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, sandy, and gravelly soils, often found in open, sun-exposed habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, forming a dense mat that helps stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Arenaria biflora is adapted to cold climates and has a shallow root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
