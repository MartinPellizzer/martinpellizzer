                <h1>Acinodendron stamineum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron stamineum, commonly known as the stamen tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, with stamens that are often more prominent than the petals. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron stamineum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elliptical leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, typically ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it splits open, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron stamineum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and partial to full sunlight. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and is not typically found in primary tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within the broader Southeast Asian biodiversity hotspot.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron stamineum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries with warm climates, such as parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Its introduction has sometimes led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, careful management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
