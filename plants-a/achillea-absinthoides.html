<p>Achillea absinthoides has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a silver-gray underside and a dark green upper surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a grayish-green color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>
