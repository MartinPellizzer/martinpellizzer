<p>Antennaria luzuloides subsp.</p>
<p>aberrans, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically forms dense mats with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
