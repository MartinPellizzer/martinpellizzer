<p>Autumnalia, commonly known as the goldenrod, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences, which are composed of many small, tubular flowers. These plants are native to the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Autumnalia species typically bloom in the late summer to early autumn, hence their common name.</p>
<p>They play an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the fall season.</p>
