                <h1>Achlys japonica</h1>
<p>Achlys japonica, commonly known as Japanese ghost flower, is a perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Achlys japonica is noted for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achlys japonica has trifoliate leaves that are ovate to cordate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a spherical, dry capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achlys japonica is primarily native to Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in forested areas and mountainous regions within these countries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing along stream banks or in thick undergrowth. The species is well adapted to the temperate climate of East Asia.</p>
<p>Its natural range is limited to these specific geographic regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achlys japonica was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in the northeastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. This plant has been documented in several states including New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont. Its introduction is largely due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
