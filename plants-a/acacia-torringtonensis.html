                    <h1>Acacia torringtonensis</h1>
<p>Acacia torringtonensis, commonly known as the Torrington acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and phyllodes that are typically linear to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to phyllodes, a feature common in many Acacia species, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia torringtonensis is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of its native range.</p>
