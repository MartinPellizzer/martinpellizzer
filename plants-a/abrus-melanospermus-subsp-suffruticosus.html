<p>Abrus melanospermus subsp.</p>
<p>suffruticosus, commonly known as the black seed dodder, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants through haustoria, drawing nutrients from its hosts.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, ornate pods that contain dark, toxic seeds. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and toxic compounds, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
