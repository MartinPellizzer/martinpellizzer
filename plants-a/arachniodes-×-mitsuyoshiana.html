<p>Arachniodes × mitsuyoshiana, commonly known as the Japanese spider fern, is a hybrid plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble spider webs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
