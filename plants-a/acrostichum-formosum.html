<p>Acrostichum formosum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome system allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in its ecological interactions.</p>
