                    <h1>Agrostis × sanionis</h1>
<p>Agrostis × sanionis, commonly known as the meadow foxtail, is a hybrid grass species resulting from the cross between Agrostis stolonifera and Agrostis canina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Agrostis × sanionis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf.</p>
