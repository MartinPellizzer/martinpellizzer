                <h1>Adenosma chenopodiifolia</h1>
<p>Adenosma chenopodiifolia, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its succulent, sprawling growth habit. The plant features small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in dry environments.</p>
<p>Adenosma chenopodiifolia is often found in sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma chenopodiifolia has leaves that are typically narrow, linear to lanceolate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat branched, with a rough, fibrous texture and a reddish-brown bark. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma chenopodiifolia is primarily native to southern China, particularly in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing in sandy soils and rocky areas. This plant is also present in parts of northern Vietnam and eastern India. It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the temperate to subtropical climate zones of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma chenopodiifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now widespread across various regions of New Zealand.</p>
