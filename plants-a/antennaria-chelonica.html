                    <h1>Antennaria chelonica</h1>
<p>Antennaria chelonica, commonly known as the creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, glandular leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Antennaria chelonica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small Arctic organisms.</p>
