                    <h1>Androsace sarmentosa var. grandifolia</h1>
<p>Androsace sarmentosa var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit with dense, prostrate stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a fine layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments at higher elevations.</p>
