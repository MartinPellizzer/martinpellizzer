                    <h1>Agrostis lateriflora</h1>
<p>Agrostis lateriflora, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common component of grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Agrostis lateriflora is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
