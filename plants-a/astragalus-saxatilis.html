<p>Astragalus saxatilis, commonly known as the rock milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments, often growing on slopes and in crevices. It has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
