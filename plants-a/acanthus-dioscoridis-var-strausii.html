The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its unique foliage makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthus dioscoridis var. strausii is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>This variety is commonly found in rocky coastal areas and limestone formations. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant is known for its ornamental leaves and is often cultivated in gardens.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthus dioscoridis var. strausii was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and architectural form.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in gardens and landscapes across southern Europe, particularly in countries like Italy, Spain, and Greece. Despite its ornamental value, it has shown potential to spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its invasive potential in certain ecosystems. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to discussions about its ecological impact and management in native habitats.</p>
