                    <h1>Alciope lanata</h1>
<p>Alciope lanata, commonly known as the woolly broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other plants. The plant is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers and a hairy, or lanate, appearance on its stems and leaves. It is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
