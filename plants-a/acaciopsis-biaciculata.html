<p>Acaciopsis biaciculata, commonly known as the two-needle acacia, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with pairs of small, needle-like leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Acaciopsis biaciculata is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fuelwood in its native habitat.</p>
