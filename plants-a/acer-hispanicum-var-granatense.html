                <h1>Acer hispanicum var. granatense</h1>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. granatense, commonly known as the Granada maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange samaras that mature in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. granatense has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-7 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, exhibiting a vertical growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during late spring, with a wind-pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to its rocky, mountainous habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. granatense is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula, particularly found in southern Spain.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Sierra de Gredos and other mountainous regions of central Spain. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in open woodlands and shrublands. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat degradation, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. granatense is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and compact size, making it ideal for smaller gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-ripe cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining varietal traits. The tree grows best in a temperate climate, entering a dormant phase in winter and actively growing in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It requires well-drained soil and regular watering during dry periods, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. granatense is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its deep root system helps in erosion control by holding soil in place during heavy rains.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. granatense is a rare and ornamental species native to southern Europe, known for its striking red leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>While it is primarily valued for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture and landscape design, it has limited direct culinary use due to its small size and non-edible parts. In traditional medicine, it has been used in local remedies for its potential anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Its presence in natural habitats contributes to biodiversity and ecological balance, supporting local flora and fauna.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and natural beauty, often featured in regional botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. granatense has several notable varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that contribute to its horticultural significance.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson Queen' and 'Autumnalis', which are valued for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habit. Hybrid varieties have been developed to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and disease resistance, making them more adaptable to different climates. These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in ornamental gardening and landscape design due to their aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer hispanicum var. granatense plays an important role in the horticultural world for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
