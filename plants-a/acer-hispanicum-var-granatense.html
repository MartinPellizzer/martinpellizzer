                    <h1>Acer hispanicum var. granatense</h1>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. granatense, commonly known as the Granada maple, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant red in the autumn. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
