                <h1>Acer pseudoplatanus var. mariae</h1>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. mariae, commonly known as the Marie's maple, is a variant of the common maple, characterized by its unique foliage and growth habits.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree or shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a serrated margin and a vibrant green color during the growing season. In autumn, they turn shades of red, orange, and yellow, making it a visually striking ornamental plant.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. mariae has leaves that are broadly ovate to rounded, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5-10 cm in length, displaying a vibrant green on top and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern with a tendency to branch out towards the middle of the plant. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the flowers are followed by paired samaras, or "keys," that are dispersed by wind. The fruit dispersal relies primarily on wind, as the seeds are light and equipped with a feathery structure.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. mariae is a variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other parts of Europe, including parts of France and Italy, where it is now cultivated. This plant thrives in temperate climates, often growing in shaded forest understories or along stream banks. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a rare species with a conservation status of near threatened.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. mariae is a variant of the maple tree known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal traits. The growth cycle includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like lavender or conifers can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. mariae is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil structure and supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and protecting against water runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in carbon sequestration, aiding in the mitigation of climate change impacts.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. mariae is a rare variant of the maple tree known for its ornamental value in horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have minor uses in traditional herbal remedies. In industrial contexts, its wood is not commonly harvested for economic purposes due to its limited availability and growth conditions. Culturally, it is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in botanical gardens to showcase genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents the beauty and uniqueness of natural variation in plant species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. mariae has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Variegatum' and 'Pendulum', which are known for their unique foliage patterns and graceful growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also frequently used in hybridization to create new varieties that combine the best traits of different species, such as improved cold hardiness and enhanced fall color. These hybrids often exhibit greater adaptability to various climates, making them popular choices for horticultural landscapes. The varietal form is particularly valued in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance lies in its contribution to the diversity of maple trees available for cultivation and its role in landscape design.</p>
