The fruit is a three-winged schizocarp that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and smooth.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, shady habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha cardiophylla is a unique plant native to the island of Socotra, located in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>While it was historically found only on Socotra, it is now also cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses around the world. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and coastal areas. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, Acalypha cardiophylla is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha cardiophylla is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique leaf shapes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant thrives in a warm, humid climate with a growth cycle that includes a dormant phase during cooler months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha cardiophylla is a flowering plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its vibrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for maintaining biodiversity. The plant also acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through mutualistic relationships.
