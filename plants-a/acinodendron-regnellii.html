                <h1>Acinodendron regnellii</h1>
<p>Acinodendron regnellii, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. It is often found in sandy soils and is part of the Rhamnaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience in harsh environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron regnellii has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, and have a pale yellow color, blooming during the dry season and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron regnellii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, specifically found in countries such as Cameroon, Gabon, and the Central African Republic.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid lowland forests and is commonly found in the understory of dense rainforests. This plant is adapted to the warm and wet climate of these regions, often growing along riverbanks and in swampy areas. It is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is an important part of the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron regnellii was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in parts of Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant thrives in shaded environments, often growing under the canopy of primary forests. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities such as horticulture and land clearing.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely cultivated or invasive in most regions outside its native range.</p>
