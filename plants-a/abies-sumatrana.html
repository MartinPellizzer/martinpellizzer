<p>Abies sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran fir, is a coniferous tree native to the high-altitude regions of Sumatra, Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along its branches. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that typically hang downward, containing seeds enclosed in woody scales. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
