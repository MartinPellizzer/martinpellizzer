                <h1>Acridocarpus goossensii</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus goossensii, commonly known as the Goossens' acridocarpus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Anacardiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces woody fruits that contain several seeds, typical of many species in its family. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus goossensii has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture that is typically light brown in color. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers with five petals, blooming during the dry season and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus goossensii is primarily native to the island of Mauritius.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, typically in moist and shaded environments. This plant is endemic to Mauritius, meaning it is not found anywhere else in the world. It grows in the understory of the forest, often near the base of large trees.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus goossensii was mainly introduced to New Caledonia, where it has become naturalized in certain forested areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid, coastal environments with well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has spread beyond its original cultivation sites.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely unknown, and it is not considered invasive in the region.</p>
