                    <h1>Allotropa virgata</h1>
<p>Allotropa virgata, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other plants such as fir trees. The plant has a simple structure with no true roots, stems, or leaves, and instead possesses a root-like structure called a haustorium that attaches to the host. It is found in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a minor but ecologically interesting role in forest ecosystems.</p>
