<p>Anacamptis urvilleana, commonly known as the Violet Orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The flower structure includes a spurred lip, which is a distinctive feature of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
