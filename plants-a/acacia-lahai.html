<p>Acacia lahai, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flattened seeds.
