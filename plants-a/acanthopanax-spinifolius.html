<p>Acanthopanax spinifolius, commonly known as the Asian dogwood or five-leaf aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which typically consist of five leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Acanthopanax spinifolius is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax spinifolius has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with leaflets that are ovate to elliptic in shape, measuring up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a serrated margin. The stem is cylindrical, rough to the touch, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age, growing upright with some branching. It produces small greenish-yellow flowers in raceme inflorescences during late spring to early summer, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a red, fleshy drupe that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by birds and animals.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax spinifolius is a shrub native to East Asia, primarily found in China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Southeast Asia, the Russian Far East, and the Indian subcontinent, often as a result of human introduction. It thrives in moist, temperate forests and mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>While it is not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is threatened by deforestation and climate change, leading to concerns about its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax spinifolius is a hardy shrub native to East Asia, known for its medicinal properties and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in temperate climates and reaching maturity over several years.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote healthy growth. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like root rot can occur in poorly drained soil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like rosemary or sage can deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax spinifolius is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity by creating a microhabitat for other species. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by adding organic matter to the soil as it decomposes.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax spinifolius is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications across various fields.</p>
