<p>Astragalus bethlehemiticus subsp.</p>
<p>argyrophyllus, commonly known as the silver-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
