<p>Asplenium patens, commonly known as the spreading spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to various regions of the world, including Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests, rock crevices, and on tree trunks. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium patens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique appearance and adaptability to different growing conditions.</p>
