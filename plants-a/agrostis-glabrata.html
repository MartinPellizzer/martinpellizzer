<p>Agrostis glabrata, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing clumps.

It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Agrostis glabrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
