                    <h1>Amorphophallus cirrifer</h1>
<p>Amorphophallus cirrifer, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves and a unique, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant produces a striking, often fragrant flower that can reach several feet in height. Its underground corm serves as a storage organ, allowing it to survive periods of drought.</p>
<p>This species is also notable for its ability to produce a strong odor similar to rotting meat, which attracts pollinators.</p>
