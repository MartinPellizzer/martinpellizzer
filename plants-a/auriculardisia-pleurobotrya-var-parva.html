                    <h1>Auriculardisia pleurobotrya var. parva</h1>
<p>Auriculardisia pleurobotrya var. parva, commonly known as the small-leafed auriculardisia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) base. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant diversity and conservation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, the species remains poorly understood and vulnerable to extinction.</p>
