                        <h1>Abronia umbellata var. breviflora</h1>
<p>Abronia umbellata var. breviflora, commonly known as the narrow-flowered sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, pink to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Plantaginaceae family and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia umbellata var. breviflora is primarily native to the coastal regions of California, particularly in the northern and central parts of the state.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shores of the Pacific Ocean. This variety thrives in coastal dunes and maritime scrub habitats. It is adapted to the harsh conditions of the coastline, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia umbellata var. breviflora was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal dunes and disturbed habitats where it can establish quickly. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its rapid growth and hardy nature. It is also valued for its showy, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to outcompete native species in certain regions.</p>
