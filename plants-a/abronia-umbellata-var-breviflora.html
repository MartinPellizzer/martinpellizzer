<p>Abronia umbellata var. breviflora, commonly known as the narrow-flowered sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, pink to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Plantaginaceae family and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats.</p>
