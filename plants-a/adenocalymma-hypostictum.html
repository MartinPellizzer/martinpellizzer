                <h1>Adenocalymma hypostictum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma hypostictum, commonly known as the red-stemmed pincushion, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, spherical fruit structures. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often with a reddish tint, and it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma hypostictum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma hypostictum has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it matures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma hypostictum is primarily native to Brazil Northeast and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is found in the northeastern and southeastern regions of Brazil, where it thrives in suitable environmental conditions. It is commonly associated with specific habitats within these regions, such as coastal areas or dry forests. The plant's distribution is limited to these geographic areas, indicating a restricted native range.</p>
<p>Its presence in these regions highlights its adaptation to the local climate and ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma hypostictum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and degraded grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. It has been observed spreading into native vegetation, potentially altering local plant communities.</p>
<p>Its introduction is often associated with human activity, including land development and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
