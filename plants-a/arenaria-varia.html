<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its compact growth form helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions such as cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>Arenaria varia plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is a common component of alpine vegetation.</p>
