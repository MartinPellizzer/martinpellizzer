<p>The plant's botanical features make it an important species in its native ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras mammosa has large, palmate leaves that are typically 30-60 cm in diameter, with a bright green color and a smooth surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a rough, fibrous bark that is pale to reddish in color, growing as a solitary trunk.
