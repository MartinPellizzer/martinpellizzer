                <h1>Acer laurinum subsp. garrettii</h1>
<p>Acer laurinum subsp.</p>
<p>garrettii, commonly known as the Garrett maple, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its colorful foliage and compact growth habit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer laurinum subsp.</p>
<p>garrettii has leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 4â€“8 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often pubescent underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, flaky layers, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern with a moderate spread.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered yellow-green flowers in early spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, and they are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread effectively.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer laurinum subsp.</p>
<p>garrettii is a rare, slow-growing maple species native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, typically found in forests and rocky slopes. This subspecies grows at elevations between 1,800 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is classified as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer laurinum subsp.</p>
<p>garrettii is a compact, ornamental maple known for its dense foliage and unique leaf shape. It can be propagated through semi-hardwood cuttings in late summer or by seed, though the latter is less common.</p>
<p>This slow-growing shrub thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring well-drained, loamy soil and consistent moisture without waterlogging. Fertilize it lightly in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sedum can enhance its appearance and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer laurinum subsp.</p>
<p>garrettii is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant in shaded or partially shaded environments, enhancing the growth of other flora. Its dense foliage helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a diverse range of organisms within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer laurinum subsp.</p>
<p>garrettii is a decorative plant commonly used in horticulture for its ornamental value, particularly for its attractive, glossy foliage and compact growth habit. While it is not typically used in culinary applications, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for aesthetic purposes.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it may have limited use in certain regions, though specific remedies are not well-documented. Industrially, it contributes to the ornamental plant trade, supporting local economies through landscaping and nursery industries.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes beauty and resilience in some communities, often featured in landscaping and public spaces.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer laurinum subsp.</p>
<p>garrettii has a variety of cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Emerald Globes' and 'Sutherlandii', which are known for their compact growth and striking foliage. It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, leading to the development of cultivars like 'Crimson King' and 'Autumnalis', which display enhanced coloration and growth habits.</p>
<p>These hybrids and cultivars are highly valued in horticulture for their ability to thrive in various climates and their aesthetic appeal. The species' adaptability makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both visual interest and hardiness.</p>
<p>Overall, its cultivars and hybrids play a significant role in landscape design and ornamental gardening.</p>
