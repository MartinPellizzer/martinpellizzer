                    <h1>Archangiopteris hokouensis</h1>
<p>Archangiopteris hokouensis, commonly known as the Hokouensis water fern, is a rare species of aquatic fern native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four parts, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in freshwater environments with still or slow-moving water, often found in ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
