                    <h1>Achyranthes diffusa</h1>
<p>Achyranthes diffusa, commonly known as Indian knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste places.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a weed and a valuable medicinal plant in traditional systems.</p>
