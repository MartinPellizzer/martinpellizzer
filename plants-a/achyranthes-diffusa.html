                <h1>Achyranthes diffusa</h1>
<p>Achyranthes diffusa, commonly known as Indian knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste places.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a weed and a valuable medicinal plant in traditional systems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes diffusa has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long, with a slightly serrated margin, and a dark green, glossy upper surface.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. The small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense spikes, bloom from summer to autumn, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes diffusa is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with moist, fertile soils, often growing along riverbanks and in open woodlands. This plant thrives in warm climates and is adapted to a variety of soil types. It is also known to occur in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across several countries in South and Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes diffusa was mainly introduced to areas where its medicinal properties are sought after for traditional and modern therapeutic uses.</p>
<p>It has been distributed in regions with warm climates, particularly in parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant is often cultivated for its roots, which are used in herbal remedies and as a tonic. Its introduction has sometimes led to its spread into natural habitats, raising concerns about ecological impact.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, careful management is needed to prevent it from becoming invasive in new environments.</p>
