                <h1>Adenosma cuspidata</h1>
<p>Adenosma cuspidata, commonly known as the pointed adenosma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a pointed tip, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Adenosma cuspidata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma cuspidata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically ranging from 3 to 6 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, exhibiting a vertical growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring five pinkish-white petals and a yellow center, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma cuspidata is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southern China and the Indian subcontinent, although its range has been reduced due to habitat loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within tropical and subtropical forests. This species typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adenosma cuspidata is listed as endangered due to deforestation and habitat degradation, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenosma cuspidata is a flowering plant known for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenosma cuspidata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Adenosma cuspidata contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and maintaining the health of its habitat.</p>
