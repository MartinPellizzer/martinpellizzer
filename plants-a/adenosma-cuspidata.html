                <h1>Adenosma cuspidata</h1>
<p>Adenosma cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adenosma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Adenosma cuspidata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma cuspidata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with five petals that are pale yellow to white in color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma cuspidata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with forest understory or disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of India and the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>Adenosma cuspidata is known for its small, clustered flowers and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma cuspidata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in sunny, open environments. This plant has shown rapid colonization abilities, leading to its establishment in various regions beyond its native range. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
