                        <h1>Acacia baileyana var. aurea</h1>
<p>Acacia baileyana var. aurea, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, yellowish-green foliage and its iconic yellow flowers that bloom in winter.

<p>The golden wattle is also a symbol of Australia and is widely cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia baileyana var. aurea is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically the coastal regions of New South Wales and southern Queensland.</p>

It is often seen in coastal dunes and open woodlands, adapting well to the salty and windy conditions of its native habitat. The plant is known for its golden foliage, which makes it a popular ornamental species.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it is not native to any other region outside of this specific area in Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia baileyana var. aurea was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive golden foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in gardens and public spaces for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions.
