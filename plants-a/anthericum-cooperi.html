                    <h1>Anthericum cooperi</h1>
<p>Anthericum cooperi, commonly known as Cooper's lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features strap-like, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slight blue or purple tint. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in early to mid-summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>The botanical name honors John Cooper, a 19th-century botanist who contributed to the study of North American flora.</p>
