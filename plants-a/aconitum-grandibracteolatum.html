                <h1>Aconitum grandibracteolatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum grandibracteolatum, commonly known as the large-bracted monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred flowers, which are typically arranged in a raceme atop a tall, unbranched stem. The plant has palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its roots are tuberous, typical of the genus Aconitum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum grandibracteolatum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are large, typically reaching up to 30 cm in diameter, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, woody at the base, and covered with a rough, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age.
