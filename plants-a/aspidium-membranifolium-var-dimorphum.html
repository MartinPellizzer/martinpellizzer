                    <h1>Aspidium membranifolium var. dimorphum</h1>
<p>Aspidium membranifolium var. dimorphum, commonly known as the two-form membranifolium, is a variant of the common water fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi-lobed. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its morphological variation, which includes differences in frond shape and size compared to the typical form.</p>
