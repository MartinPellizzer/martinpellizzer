<p>Atraphaxis billardierei subsp.</p>
<p>tournefortii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to grow in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its structure and appearance make it well-suited for xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>
