<p>Acrodiclidium armeniacum, commonly known as Armenian sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of pale blue or violet flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. Its growth habit and morphology are typical of xerophytic plants, with features that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acrodiclidium armeniacum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
