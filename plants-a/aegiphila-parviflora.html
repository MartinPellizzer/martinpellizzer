<p>Aegiphila parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered aegiphila, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Aegiphila parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth and fragrant foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila parviflora has leaves that are typically lanceolate or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown bark, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or white, with a tubular structure, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects.
