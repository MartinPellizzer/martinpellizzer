<p>Athyrium kenzo-satakei var. jieguishanense, commonly known as the Jieguishan maidenhair fern, is a rare variant of the maidenhair fern family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically display a dark green color with a glossy surface. Native to the mountainous regions of China, this plant thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
