<p>Asplenium praemorsum var. artemisiifolium, commonly known as the Artemisia-leaved spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its distinctive foliage, which resembles the leaves of the Artemisia genus, giving it its common name.</p>
