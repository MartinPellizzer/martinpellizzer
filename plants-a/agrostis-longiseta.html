                    <h1>Agrostis longiseta</h1>
<p>Agrostis longiseta, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features fine, slender blades with a distinctive silky texture due to the presence of long, soft hairs on its leaf surfaces. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is slender and often curved, bearing small, two-lobed flowers.</p>
<p>Silky bentgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes for its fine texture and resilience.</p>
