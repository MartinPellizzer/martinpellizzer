                <h1>Acalypha subsessilis</h1>
<p>Acalypha subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1–3 meters. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or red, and it produces distinctive, winged fruits.</p>
<p>Acalypha subsessilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha subsessilis has ovate to elliptic leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to brownish bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring yellowish-green petals and stamens, and bloom during the summer months, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb nutrients efficiently from the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha subsessilis is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Oceania and the Pacific Islands, where it has been introduced as an ornamental or weed. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in lowland forests or along stream banks. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as near threatened in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha subsessilis is a fast-growing, ornamental shrub known for its vibrant foliage and compact form, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil, with regular watering to keep the soil moist but not waterlogged. Fertilize it with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>While generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered, and it benefits from companion planting with herbs like rosemary or lavender to deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha subsessilis is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its colorful flowers, promoting biodiversity and plant reproduction. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of neighboring species by improving soil conditions. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil and prevents runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence enhances habitat diversity, benefiting both insects and small vertebrates.</p>
