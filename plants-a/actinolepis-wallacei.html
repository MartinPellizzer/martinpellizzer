                <h1>Actinolepis wallacei</h1>
<p>Actinolepis wallacei, commonly known as the Wallace's actinolepis, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with lance-shaped leaves that have a glossy surface. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>Actinolepis wallacei is often found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinolepis wallacei has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips as the plant matures. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in panicles, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinolepis wallacei is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is found in the island of Mindanao and the nearby Sulu Archipelago. This plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and secondary forests. It is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinolepis wallacei was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century by European botanists and horticulturalists who were interested in exotic species. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its rapid spread and ecological impact.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to manage its population and prevent further spread.</p>
