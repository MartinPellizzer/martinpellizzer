                <h1>Acianthera wyvern</h1>
<p>Acianthera wyvern, commonly known as the wyvern orchid, is a rare and exotic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet and white flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help it conserve water in its humid environment. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, decomposing organic matter in the forest floor.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, the wyvern orchid is now classified as critically endangered.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera wyvern has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that exhibits a twisting growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals with a yellow center, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera wyvern is primarily native to Colombia and Ecuador.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the Andean regions of these countries. It thrives in humid, tropical mountainous environments. The plant is commonly associated with cloud forests and high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera wyvern was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with rich organic soil, often near the base of trees or in undergrowth. This plant has been reported in several tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, its spread requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
