                    <h1>Acianthera wyvern</h1>
<p>Acianthera wyvern, commonly known as the wyvern orchid, is a rare and exotic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet and white flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help it conserve water in its humid environment. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, decomposing organic matter in the forest floor.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, the wyvern orchid is now classified as critically endangered.</p>
