<p>Aspidium ocellatum, commonly known as the eye-spotted water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Water Ferns.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often adorned with small, eye-like spots, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes are anchored to the substrate, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Aspidium ocellatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
