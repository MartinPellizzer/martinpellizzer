                <h1>Adenosma villosa</h1>
<p>Adenosma villosa, commonly known as the hairy adenosma, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, as well as small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Adenosma villosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma villosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 3 to 7 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with fine, soft hairs, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, with tubular corollas that are typically pink or purple, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma villosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with forest understories or open grasslands. It is also occasionally found in parts of southern China and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Adenosma villosa is known for its hairy stems and small, often white or yellowish flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma villosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. Its spread has been facilitated by its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its prolific seed production.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
