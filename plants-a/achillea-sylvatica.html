<p>Achillea sylvatica, commonly known as mountain yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, such as meadows and hillsides. Its feathery leaves and flat-topped clusters of white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sylvatica has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly reddish-brown in color, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk florets surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene, with small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sylvatica is a flowering plant native to Europe, particularly found in the mountainous regions of the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that includes parts of Central and Eastern Europe, though its range has been reduced due to habitat loss. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Achillea sylvatica is considered to be of conservation concern due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat fragmentation and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea sylvatica is a hardy perennial known for its fluffy, yellow flowers and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that involves a dormant period in winter, followed by rapid growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
