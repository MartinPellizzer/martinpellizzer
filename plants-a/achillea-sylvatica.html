                <h1>Achillea sylvatica</h1>
<p>Achillea sylvatica, commonly known as mountain yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It features pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in traditional medicine and has a long history of cultivation for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sylvatica has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and linear, typically ranging from 5 to 15 centimeters in length. The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a grayish-brown color, growing in a clump or spreading manner. The flowers are yellow, consisting of a central disk surrounded by ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and lightweight structure.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sylvatica is primarily native to southern and eastern Europe, including countries such as France, Italy, Spain, and parts of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in woodland areas, open woodlands, and along the edges of forests. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with shaded or semi-shaded habitats. It is also known to occur in parts of western Asia, particularly in regions with temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with a mild climate and sufficient rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sylvatica was mainly introduced to ornamental gardens and landscaping due to its attractive, feathery foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is often used in wildflower mixes and as a border plant because of its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it has also become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. Its spread is facilitated by its prolific seed production and adaptability to disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Careful management is necessary to prevent its unintended ecological impact.</p>
