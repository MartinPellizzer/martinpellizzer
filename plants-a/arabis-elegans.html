                    <h1>Arabis elegans</h1>
<p>Arabis elegans, commonly known as the elegant rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a raceme. Arabis elegans thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged flowering period.</p>
