                <h1>Aconitum cannabifolium</h1>
<p>Aconitum cannabifolium, commonly known as the cannabis-leaved monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble cannabis leaves, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum cannabifolium has large, compound leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a deep green color and a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are blue to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the plant, with a spurred petal and a complex structure that facilitates pollination by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fibrous, and tuberous, aiding in water and nutrient storage.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum cannabifolium is primarily native to China North-Central, China South-Central, and China Southeast.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in mountainous regions within these areas. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The species is often associated with forested or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions within China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum cannabifolium was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly during the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It was often planted as an ornamental due to its striking blue flowers and attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native plant species in wetland and riparian habitats. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to thrive in moist soils and its prolific seed production.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect native ecosystems.</p>
