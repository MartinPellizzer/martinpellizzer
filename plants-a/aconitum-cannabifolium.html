<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble cannabis leaves, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
