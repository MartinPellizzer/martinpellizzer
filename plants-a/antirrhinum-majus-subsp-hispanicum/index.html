                            <h1>Antirrhinum Majus Subsp. Hispanicum</h1>
<p>Antirrhinum majus subsp. hispanicum is a lesser-known variant of the common snapdragon known for its vibrant flower colors and unique growth habits. Native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, this subspecies thrives in warmer climates and well-drained soils. Its flowers, which range from deep red to bright yellow, bloom in clusters and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Despite its beauty, it is often overshadowed by its more widely cultivated relatives. This plant is a valuable addition to gardens and botanical collections due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
