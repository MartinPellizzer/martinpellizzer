                <h1>Aegiphila inflexa</h1>
<p>Aegiphila inflexa, commonly known as the silverleaf aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila inflexa has leaves that are opposite in arrangement, lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a rough, grayish-brown bark and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
