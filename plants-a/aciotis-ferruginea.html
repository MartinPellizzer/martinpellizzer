                <h1>Aciotis ferruginea</h1>
<p>Aciotis ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, yellowish-green foliage. The plant produces small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in moist, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Aciotis ferruginea is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional medicine for various ailments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis ferruginea has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and has a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, growing upright with a slightly branched pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellow petals and a prominent central disk, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis ferruginea is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia. This plant thrives in humid environments, often growing in lowland areas with rich, well-drained soil. It is typically associated with disturbed habitats, including roadsides and secondary forests.</p>
<p>Aciotis ferruginea is also occasionally found in parts of the Caribbean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis ferruginea was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Mediterranean region due to its adaptability to diverse soil conditions.</p>
<p>It has been observed thriving in disturbed areas such as roadsides and agricultural fields. The plant's rapid growth and ability to reproduce through both seeds and vegetative propagation contribute to its successful establishment. It has become a common weed in several countries, often outcompeting native flora.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
