<p>Asplenium antrophyoides, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a dark green to bronze coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Asplenium antrophyoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
