                <h1>Acer saccharophorum var. subvestitum</h1>
<p>Acer saccharophorum var. subvestitum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree has opposite, ovate leaves that are often serrated along the edges. Its flowers are small and green, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer saccharophorum var. subvestitum has leaves that are broadly ovate to round in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in diameter, and a dark green color on the upper surface with a lighter green or sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in clusters, with yellowish-green petals and a short blooming period in late spring; they are primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The root system is shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer saccharophorum var. subvestitum is a rare variant of the sugar maple found primarily in the southeastern United States, originally native to the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in Georgia and South Carolina. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests, often near streams or in shaded understory environments. It typically grows at elevations between 300 and 600 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is considered endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer saccharophorum var. subvestitum is a slow-growing, ornamental maple known for its striking red stems and delicate foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster and more reliable results. This variety thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging.</p>
<p>Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the tree and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with horticultural oils.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in shaded garden settings.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer saccharophorum var. subvestitum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer saccharophorum var. subvestitum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its sap can be tapped for syrup production similar to other maple species.</p>
<p>It has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Industrially, it contributes to the timber industry, providing durable wood for furniture and construction. Culturally, it is valued in certain regions for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes planted in gardens.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents resilience and adaptability due to its ability to thrive in diverse environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer saccharophorum var. subvestitum has several popular cultivars, including 'Autumn Flame' and 'Coral Crown', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also used in hybridization to create ornamental maple varieties with enhanced foliage and structural characteristics. Hybrids involving this species often combine the hardiness of sugar maple with the aesthetic appeal of other maple types. Its horticultural importance lies in its adaptability to various climates and its ability to thrive in urban landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique features, it remains a valuable choice for landscape designers and gardeners seeking both beauty and resilience.</p>
