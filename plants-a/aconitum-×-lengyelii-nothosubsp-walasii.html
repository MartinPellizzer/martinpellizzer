                <h1>Aconitum × lengyelii nothosubsp. walasii</h1>
<p>Aconitum × lengyelii nothosubsp.</p>
<p>walasii, commonly known as the Walasii hybrid belladonna, is a hybrid species within the genus Aconitum, characterized by its striking blue to purple floral spires. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly the Alps.</p>
<p>The plant features large, palmately compound leaves with a coarse texture and serrated edges. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, terminal clusters, and it produces distinctive, waxy, blue-black seeds in follicles.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care, as all parts contain potent alkaloids.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum × lengyelii nothosubsp.</p>
<p>walasii has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is upright, usually hairy, and has a rough, grayish bark that becomes smoother with age.</p>
<p>Its flowers are large, showy, and blue-purple in color, with spurred petals and a complex structure, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum × lengyelii nothosubsp.</p>
<p>walasii is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin. Its current distribution includes parts of Hungary, Romania, and neighboring countries, where it has been found growing in disturbed or semi-natural habitats.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as meadows, forest edges, and along stream banks. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered a rare species with a conservation status of least concern, though it requires protection to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum × lengyelii nothosubsp.</p>
<p>walasii is a striking hybrid perennial known for its tall, spiky flowers and dark green foliage. It can be propagated through seed or division, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>This plant has a biennial growth cycle, reaching full maturity and flowering in its second year. It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning of dead foliage in late fall helps maintain its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs, making companion planting with marigolds or garlic beneficial for natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aconitum × lengyelii nothosubsp.</p>
<p>walasii is a tall, showy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its dense foliage and robust growth habit offer shelter and habitat for various small wildlife species, including insects and birds.</p>
<p>It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the aesthetic and ecological diversity of the landscape. While it does not fix nitrogen, its deep root system helps with erosion control in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Overall, this plant plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Aconitum × lengyelii nothosubsp.</p>
<p>walasii is a hybrid plant primarily known for its ornamental value in gardens and horticulture due to its striking blue to purple flowers. While it is not used in culinary applications, it has historical interest in traditional medicine, though its toxicity limits practical use.</p>
<p>The plant holds economic value in the floriculture industry, contributing to the ornamental plant trade. Culturally, it is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and botanical collections.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological settings is limited, but it may support pollinators in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Aconitum × lengyelii nothosubsp.</p>
<p>walasii has a range of popular cultivars such as 'Blue Beauty' and 'Sutherlandii', which are prized for their striking blue to purple flowers and robust growth. This hybrid, derived from crosses between Aconitum lengyelii and Aconitum carpathicum, showcases enhanced hardiness and floral display compared to its parent species.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance lies in its adaptability to various garden conditions and its role in adding dramatic color to shady landscapes. Cultivars of this nothosubspecies are favored by gardeners for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Overall, it is a significant addition to the aconite family in modern horticulture.</p>
