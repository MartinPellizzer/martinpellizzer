                    <h1>Ataxia</h1>
<p>Ataxia, commonly known as a neurological disorder, is not a plant but a medical condition affecting coordination.</p>
<p>It is not related to any botanical species or plant characteristics. The term "ataxia" originates from the Greek word for "without order," reflecting its impact on motor control. It is important to distinguish it from plant names that may share similar sounds.</p>
<p>This clarification ensures accurate understanding in both botanical and medical contexts.</p>
