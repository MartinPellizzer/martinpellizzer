                    <h1>Agrostis tenuis var. microstachys</h1>
<p>Agrostis tenuis var. microstachys, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along streambanks. Its fine texture and ability to tolerate moderate foot traffic make it a valuable component of turfgrass mixtures.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its slender stems, short rhizomes, and small, pale green leaves.</p>
