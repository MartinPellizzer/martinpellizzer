<p>Aira purpureoargentea, commonly known as the silver-purple airgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are distinctly silver-white on the upper surface and a purplish hue on the underside, giving it its striking appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique coloration and habitat preferences, it is a valuable indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
