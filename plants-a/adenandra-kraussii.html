<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves and produces small, woody pods that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Adenandra kraussii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in gardens and landscapes for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra kraussii has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a leathery texture and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree.
