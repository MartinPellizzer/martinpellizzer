                <h1>Adonis microcarpa</h1>
<p>Adonis microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf adonis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with prominent yellow anthers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis microcarpa has small, narrow, needle-like leaves that are alternate in arrangement, typically less than 1 cm in length, and are a bright green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and exhibits a branching growth pattern, with a light green to reddish-brown bark. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis microcarpa is primarily native to Algeria, Baleares, Canary Is., Cyprus, East Aegean Is., Egypt, France, Greece, Iran, Iraq, Italy, Krym, Lebanon-Syria, Libya, Madeira, Morocco, NW.</p>
<p>Balkan Pen., Palestine, Portugal, Sardegna, Sicilia, Spain, Tunisia, Türkey, and Türkey-in-Europe. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including rocky soils and coastal areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in Mediterranean climates, where it contributes to the region's floral diversity. Adonis microcarpa is known for its delicate yellow flowers and is often associated with sunny, well-drained environments.</p>
<p>Its widespread native range highlights its adaptability to different ecological conditions across the Mediterranean basin.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis microcarpa was mainly introduced to Germany, New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in various habitats across these regions. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in coastal and inland areas. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and disturbed environments.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems remains a topic of ongoing study.</p>
