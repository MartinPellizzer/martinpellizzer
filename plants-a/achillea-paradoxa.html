                <h1>Achillea paradoxa</h1>
<p>Achillea paradoxa, commonly known as the Paradoxal Yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, silver-gray leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Achillea paradoxa is relatively drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea paradoxa has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a gray-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and has a pale green color with a slightly hairy surface, growing from the base of the plant. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and deep, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea paradoxa is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, as well as in open woodlands and grasslands. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions typical of its native habitat. It is often seen growing along cliffs, slopes, and in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the Mediterranean Basin, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea paradoxa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and on disturbed sites such as roadsides and gravel tracks. This plant is considered an environmental weed due to its ability to spread rapidly and outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate a range of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
