<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>trilobum, commonly known as the Turkish maple, is a deciduous tree native to Turkey and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three lobes, giving it a unique appearance.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky or mountainous regions, adapting well to dry and poor soil conditions.</p>
