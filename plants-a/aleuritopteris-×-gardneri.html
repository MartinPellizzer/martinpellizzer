<p>Aleuritopteris × gardneri, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Aleuritopteris pterodonta and Aleuritopteris macrophylla.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of other ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in humid forests.
