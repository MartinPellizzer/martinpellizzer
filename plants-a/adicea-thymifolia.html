                <h1>Adicea thymifolia</h1>
<p>Adicea thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, small, evergreen leaves that resemble those of thyme. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing on rocky or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Adicea thymifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea thymifolia has leaves that are opposite in arrangement, ovate in shape, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal umbels, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea thymifolia is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and rocky habitats, often growing in dry and sunny areas. The plant is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. It is also sometimes seen in open woodlands and along rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the arid and semi-arid regions of these countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea thymifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread across various regions, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it poses a threat to native ecosystems by outcompeting local flora.</p>
