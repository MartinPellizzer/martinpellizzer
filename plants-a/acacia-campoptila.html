                        <h1>Acacia campoptila</h1>
<p>Acacia campoptila, commonly known as the white wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting a variety of pollinators. Acacia campoptila is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia campoptila is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and rocky areas. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with sclerophyllous vegetation. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Acacia campoptila plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native animals and insects.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia campoptila was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and provide forage for livestock in semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility. However, it has been reported to spread aggressively and potentially outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to both ecological benefits and management challenges in some areas.</p>
