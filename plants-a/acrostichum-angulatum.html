                <h1>Acrostichum angulatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum angulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hibiscus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Acrostichum angulatum is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum angulatum has large, feather-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can reach up to 3 meters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and woody, with a rough, fibrous bark that is typically brown in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are greenish-yellow in color and bloom during the summer months, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a cluster of small, dry, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it to spread vegetatively along the ground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum angulatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove forests, and wetlands where it thrives in saline or brackish water conditions. This plant is also present in the Caribbean islands and along the Atlantic coast of the United States. It prefers humid climates and is often associated with disturbed or tidal soils.</p>
<p>Acrostichum angulatum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum angulatum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in wet, saline environments and is often found along shorelines and tidal flats. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Proper management strategies are essential to control its spread and mitigate ecological damage.</p>
