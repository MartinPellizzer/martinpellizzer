                <h1>Adenocalymma ciliolatum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma ciliolatum, commonly known as the silky bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive silvery foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are hairy and have a velvety texture, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma ciliolatum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma ciliolatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, and has a smooth, pale green bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the cooler months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma ciliolatum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these countries. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. It is often seen in grasslands and along rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma ciliolatum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, gravel pits, and disturbed agricultural lands.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common weed in semi-arid regions. The plant spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, water, and animals. It is particularly problematic in areas where native vegetation has been disrupted.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can outcompete native plants and reduce biodiversity in invaded habitats.</p>
