                <h1>Acosta diffusa</h1>
<p>Acosta diffusa, commonly known as the spreading acosta, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercialized.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta diffusa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green to brownish color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta diffusa is primarily native to South America, specifically the Andean region.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. This plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in mountainous areas with cool and temperate climates. It is commonly found in grasslands and open shrublands.</p>
<p>Acosta diffusa is well adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the Andes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta diffusa was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has established itself in various regions, particularly in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse conditions have contributed to its spread. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to other more aggressive invaders.</p>
