<p>Antennaria friesiana subsp.</p>
<p>neoalaskana, commonly known as the Alaska sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to the harsh conditions of its native range.</p>
