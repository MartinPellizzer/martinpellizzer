                    <h1>Acacia lowei</h1>
<p>Acacia lowei, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in winter. The leaves are small, feathery, and often shed during dry periods, a feature common in drought-resistant plants. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and the plant produces small, woody pods that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Acacia lowei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, low-nutrient soils.</p>
