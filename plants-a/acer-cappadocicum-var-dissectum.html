                <h1>Acer cappadocicum var. dissectum</h1>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected maple, is a variant of the Cappadocian maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. It typically grows to a height of 5 to 10 meters and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The leaves turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, making it a striking ornamental tree.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. dissectum has palmately compound leaves that are deeply dissected, giving them a feathery appearance, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes flaky with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and arranged in upright clusters. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant, though it is not particularly aggressive in spreading.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. dissectum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Turkey, specifically in the Cappadocia area.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited to this region, it is now cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections across Europe and North America. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils, often found in rocky or forested slopes. This variant typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. dissectum is a striking ornamental tree known for its delicate, finely dissected leaves that create a dramatic visual effect.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle of this species is moderate, with a slow to medium growth rate, making it suitable for smaller gardens.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning should focus on shaping and removing dead or diseased branches. This plant is relatively pest and disease resistant, though it may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support beneficial insect life.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. dissectum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. dissectum is a decorative tree known for its unique, finely dissected leaves that make it a popular choice in ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>While not typically used in culinary applications, its aesthetic value contributes to landscape design and urban greening efforts. In traditional medicine, it has been used in some regions for its potential anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty due to its striking appearance, often featured in local parks and gardens.</p>
<p>Economically, it supports the horticultural industry by providing ornamental value and contributing to tourism in botanical settings.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
