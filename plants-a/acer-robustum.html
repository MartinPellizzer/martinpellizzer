                <h1>Acer robustum</h1>
<p>Acer robustum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, ornamental foliage that displays a range of colors from bright green to deep red and orange, particularly in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. Its leaves are palmately lobed, usually with three to five lobes, and are arranged alternately along the branches.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer robustum has broad, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in diameter, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is relatively smooth with a greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, arranged in upright clusters, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer robustum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam and Thailand, where it has been introduced and occasionally naturalized. It thrives in humid, temperate climates, typically growing in mixed forests and along stream sides. Acer robustum is usually found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, it is considered a species of concern, though its conservation status is not yet fully assessed.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer robustum is a hardy maple species known for its rapid growth and vibrant fall foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer robustum includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health.</p>
<p>Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while diseases like verticillium wilt can affect it, making companion planting with garlic or marigold beneficial for natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer robustum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers and abundant nectar. Its deep root system acts as an effective erosion control agent, stabilizing soil in forested areas. The tree also serves as a companion plant in mixed hardwood forests, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a healthy ecosystem.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and offers aesthetic value through its vibrant fall foliage.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer robustum is a species of maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While its fruits are not commonly used in culinary applications, the tree provides habitat and food for various wildlife species. In traditional medicine, parts of the tree have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions. The wood of Acer robustum is valued for its strength and durability, making it suitable for furniture and construction.</p>
<p>Culturally, the tree symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in local landscapes and artistic expressions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer robustum has a limited number of naturally occurring varieties, but it is widely cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Erythroplum' with its striking red foliage and 'Laciniatum' known for its finely cut leaves. Hybrid forms have been developed to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and fall color. These hybrids are particularly valuable in horticulture for their adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer robustum and its cultivars and hybrids play an important role in landscape design and garden aesthetics.</p>
