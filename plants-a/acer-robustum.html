                <h1>Acer robustum</h1>
<p>Acer robustum, commonly known as the robust maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and has a dense, rounded canopy.</p>
<p>Acer robustum prefers well-drained soils and is often found in temperate forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer robustum has broad, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-7 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that develops fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, providing stability and efficient water absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer robustum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and Myanmar, where it has been introduced and occasionally naturalized. This plant thrives in temperate to subtropical climates, typically found in moist, well-drained soils within forested areas. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer robustum is considered to be of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer robustum is a hardy maple tree known for its rapid growth and vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle of Acer robustum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and annual pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering plants can enhance its ornamental value and support beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer robustum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for maintaining ecosystem balance. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity by creating microhabitats. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding land.</p>
<p>Acer robustum contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil quality and offering shade, which supports a wide range of plant and animal life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer robustum is a deciduous tree native to Asia, known for its ecological and practical significance.</p>
<p>Its timber is valued in the industrial and economic sectors for furniture and construction due to its durability and strength. In traditional medicine, parts of the tree have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions. Culturally, it holds symbolic meaning in some regions, representing resilience and growth.</p>
<p>However, its culinary use is limited, as its fruits are not commonly consumed by humans.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer robustum has several popular cultivars such as 'Columnare', known for its narrow, upright growth, and 'Globosum', which features a rounded, compact form.</p>
<p>It also has natural hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the genetic diversity within the genus. These varieties are valued for their ornamental appeal, with vibrant fall colors and unique foliage patterns. Horticulturally, Acer robustum is important for its adaptability to various climates and soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its cultivars and hybrids are widely used in landscaping and garden design.</p>
