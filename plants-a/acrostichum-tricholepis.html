                <h1>Acrostichum tricholepis</h1>
<p>Acrostichum tricholepis, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its fronds are usually leathery and have a rough texture, with a serrated or lobed margin.</p>
<p>Acrostichum tricholepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tricholepis has broad, leathery leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 30 to 60 cm in length, with a deep green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and smooth, with a pale green to light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in dense clusters. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind once it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in wetland habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tricholepis is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove forests and brackish water areas. This plant is well adapted to saline conditions and often grows in association with other halophytic species. Its distribution is closely linked to the presence of estuaries and tidal flats where it can tolerate fluctuating water levels.</p>
<p>Acrostichum tricholepis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tricholepis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along waterways. This plant is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in several countries, prompting management efforts to control its spread.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and use in traditional medicine.</p>
