                <h1>Aegiphila macrantha</h1>
<p>Aegiphila macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered aegiphila, is a perennial shrub native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to violet. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila macrantha has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils in which the plant typically grows.</p>
