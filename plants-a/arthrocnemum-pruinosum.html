<p>Arthrocnemum pruinosum, commonly known as the silver desert grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are adapted for pollination by wind or insects. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Arthrocnemum pruinosum plays a vital role in stabilizing desert soils and preventing erosion.</p>
