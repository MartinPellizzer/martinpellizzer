                    <h1>Arundo sabuli</h1>
<p>Arundo sabuli, commonly known as the desert reed, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in riverbanks and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
