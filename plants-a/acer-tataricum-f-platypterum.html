                <h1>Acer tataricum f. platypterum</h1>
<p>Acer tataricum f. platypterum, commonly known as the flat-leaf maple, is a variant of the Tatarian maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive flat, broad leaves that are usually bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Siberia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant autumn foliage and unique leaf shape.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. platypterum has broad, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically flattened and have a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and vary in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a deep green color during the growing season.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in catkins, with a greenish-yellow color, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. platypterum is a variant of the Tatarian maple, native to the Far East, specifically China and parts of Russia.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to specific regions in China, particularly in the provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin. It thrives in moist, temperate climates, often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. This species typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered a rare species and is under threat, requiring conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. platypterum is a decorative shrub known for its broad, palmate leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings taken in early summer or by dividing mature clumps. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 5 to 10 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the plant and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials like hostas or ferns can enhance its ornamental value in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. platypterum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of nearby species through mutualistic relationships. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity of its habitat by offering ecological benefits such as habitat creation and nutrient cycling.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. platypterum is a decorative plant commonly used in horticulture for its ornamental value, particularly for its distinctive broad, flat leaves that add visual interest to gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, it may be grown for its aesthetic appeal in ornamental gardening. In traditional medicine, some members of the Acer genus have been used for their potential health benefits, though specific applications for this variety are less documented.
