                <h1>Aechmea grandiceps</h1>
<p>Aechmea grandiceps, commonly known as the pink pineapple or the red torch bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The leaves are typically broad, waxy, and have a vibrant green to reddish hue, depending on the variety. It produces an inflorescence that can range from pink to red, with showy bracts that add to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea grandiceps has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, leathery, and dark green, arranged in a compact circle around the central stem.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, dark brown bark that grows upward from the base. Its flowers are clustered in a dense inflorescence, featuring vibrant red bracts with yellow spathes, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by birds. The plant produces berries that contain small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by animals feeding on the fruit.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor the plant in its native habitat, often in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
