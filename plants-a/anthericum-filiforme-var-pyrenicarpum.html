<p>Anthericum filiforme var. pyrenicarpum, commonly known as the Pyrenean thread-leaf fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and fibrous, contributing to its ability to anchor itself in challenging terrain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
