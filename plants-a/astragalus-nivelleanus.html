                    <h1>Astragalus nivelleanus</h1>
<p>Astragalus nivelleanus, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Astragalus nivelleanus plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates.</p>
