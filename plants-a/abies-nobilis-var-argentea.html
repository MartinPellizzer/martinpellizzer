<p>Abies nobilis var. argentea, commonly known as the silver fir, is a variant of the noble fir native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silvery-white undersides on its needle-like leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in coniferous forests at high elevations, preferring cool and moist conditions. Its cones are cylindrical and contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The silver fir is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for use in landscaping and forestry.</p>
