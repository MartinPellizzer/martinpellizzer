<p>Acetosella natans, commonly known as floating sorrel, is a small, herbaceous plant that thrives in wet or aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that often remain buoyant on the surface of water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, making it a common sight in marshes and ponds.</p>
<p>Acetosella natans is also known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to their high oxalic acid content.</p>
