                    <h1>Alopecurus alpinus f. antarcticus</h1>
<p>Alopecurus alpinus f. antarcticus, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species adapted to cold and harsh environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers. This plant is typically found in alpine and subantarctic regions, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its ability to survive in extreme climates makes it an important component of polar and high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its resilience and unique adaptations to low temperatures and strong winds.</p>
