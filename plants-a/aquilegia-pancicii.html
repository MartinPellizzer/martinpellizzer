                    <h1>Aquilegia pancicii</h1>
<p>Aquilegia pancicii, commonly known as the Pancici's columbine, is a rare and endangered species native to the alpine regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue and violet spurred petals, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it faces harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
