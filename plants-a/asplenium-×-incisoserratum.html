<p>Asplenium × incisoserratum, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a sterile fern species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, finely divided, and serrated leaflets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky substrates. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>As a hybrid, it exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
