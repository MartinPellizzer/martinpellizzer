                <h1>Acinodendron glomeratum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered acacia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like species that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Acinodendron glomeratum is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron glomeratum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spherical inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron glomeratum is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa, including countries such as Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas, woodland savannas, and along riverbanks. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with moderate to high rainfall. It is often associated with secondary vegetation and can be found in both natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it plays an important role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron glomeratum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and degraded forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. It is commonly found in Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
