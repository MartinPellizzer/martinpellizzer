                <h1>Aegiphila densiflora</h1>
<p>Aegiphila densiflora, commonly known as the denseflowered aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, aromatic leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila densiflora has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically less than 5 cm in length and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy, branching pattern. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring tubular pink to reddish petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
