<p>Arenaria aggregata subsp.</p>
<p>erinacea, commonly known as the hairy sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and rocky habitats in the western United States. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with branching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are typically hairy and narrow, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in coastal dunes and inland sand plains, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
