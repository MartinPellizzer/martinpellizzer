                        <h1>Acanthopanax spinosus var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Acanthopanax spinosus var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy devil's ivy, is a shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and hairy leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small greenish-white flowers followed by red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its adaptability makes it a common ornamental plant in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax spinosus var. pubescens is primarily native to eastern Asia, including regions such as China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas, particularly in temperate and subtropical climates. This variant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with mixed deciduous and evergreen forests. It is particularly prevalent in the mountainous regions of southern China, where it grows at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is also found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and the Philippines.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax spinosus var. pubescens was mainly introduced to regions with temperate to subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in forest edges, shrublands, and disturbed areas due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions. It has been reported in parts of East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan, where it has established itself in native ecosystems. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its invasive potential in new habitats.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is still limited compared to other introduced species in these regions.</p>
