The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Argythamnia desertorum plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
