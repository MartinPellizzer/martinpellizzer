<p>Aconitum septemcarpum, commonly known as the seven-ovary aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that bear large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces distinctive, clustered fruits known as follicles, which contain the toxic seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is handled with care and is not commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
