                    <h1>Aubrieta diffusa</h1>
<p>Aubrieta diffusa, commonly known as Persian speedwell, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features compact, evergreen foliage with a dense covering of tiny, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright blue or violet flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. Aubrieta diffusa is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is also drought-tolerant and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
