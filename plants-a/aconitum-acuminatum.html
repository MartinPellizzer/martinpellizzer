                <h1>Aconitum acuminatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum acuminatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided, lance-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Aconitum acuminatum contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires caution when handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum acuminatum has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically reaching up to 20 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat hairy, with a smooth, bluish-green bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are blue to violet, arranged in racemes, and have five petal-like sepals and showy spurred petals, blooming from July to September and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, serving as storage organs and anchoring the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>
