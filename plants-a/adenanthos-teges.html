                <h1>Adenanthos teges</h1>
<p>Adenanthos teges, commonly known as the coastal adenanthos, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pink or red flowers in clusters. It thrives in sandy or rocky coastal soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Adenanthos teges is often found in heathlands and is an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos teges has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 3 to 8 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a low shrub. The flowers are small, white to pale pink, with five petals and stamens, blooming from late autumn to early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos teges is a flowering plant native to southern Australia, specifically found in the coastal regions of South Australia and the Riverland area.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to these regions, where it grows in sandy soils along riverbanks and coastal dunes. The plant thrives in a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It is typically found at low altitudes, ranging from sea level to approximately 50 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adenanthos teges is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and fragmentation, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenanthos teges is a hardy shrub native to Australia, known for its striking silver foliage and vibrant flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in cooler climates and requiring full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and should be watered sparingly to avoid root rot. Fertilize it lightly in spring and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or sage can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
