                <h1>Acorus calamus var. verus</h1>
<p>Acorus calamus var. verus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that spreads horizontally, allowing it to colonize moist soils effectively. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are usually bright green and slightly glossy. Its flowers are small and clustered in spadices, typical of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils due to its aromatic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. verus has elongated, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often yellowish underside.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, with a smooth, light green to yellowish bark that grows from the base of the plant. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense, spike-like inflorescences during the summer months, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, berry-like structure that contains three seeds, which are dispersed by water and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense network that helps the plant anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. verus is a variant of the sweet flag plant native to eastern Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited, with populations primarily found in specific wetland areas of China. This plant thrives in moist, swampy environments, often near freshwater bodies, and is commonly found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and degradation, it is considered a species of concern and is listed as near threatened in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. verus is a hardy aquatic plant commonly grown in wetlands and water gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through rhizome division or by sowing seeds, though the latter is less common. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, clay-like soil and requires consistent watering to maintain saturated conditions. For best results, apply a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and prune dead foliage to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or snails in overwatered conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with water lilies or cattails can enhance its aesthetic and ecological value in a wetland setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. verus is a wetland plant that provides food and shelter for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and insects, as well as birds and small mammals that feed on its seeds. It acts as a natural erosion control plant by stabilizing soil along water edges. Additionally, it helps improve water quality by filtering pollutants.</p>
<p>Its presence also supports biodiversity by creating a habitat for a range of wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. verus is a versatile plant with a wide range of uses and applications.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, its rhizomes are used to flavor beverages and dishes, particularly in traditional Indian and Eastern European cuisines. Medicinally, it has been utilized for its purported properties in treating digestive issues and as a sedative. Industrially, its essential oils are used in perfumery and as a natural insect repellent.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in various traditions, often associated with purification and spiritual practices.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. verus has several popular cultivars that are widely used in aquatic and marginal pond settings, including 'Aureus' and 'Variegatus', which are prized for their striking foliage.</p>
<p>While this variety is not commonly hybridized, some horticulturists have crossed it with other Acorus species to create more resilient or ornamental forms. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and adaptability to wet conditions make it a valuable addition to water gardens. The plant's ability to thrive in moist environments contributes to its horticultural importance in landscaping and pond ecosystems.</p>
<p>Overall, Acorus calamus var. verus remains a favored choice for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
