                <h1>Actinodaphne novoguineensis</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea actinodaphne, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of New Guinea and is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and the plant plays a role in the ecological systems of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne novoguineensis has simple, alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in panicle inflorescences, and they bloom during the rainy season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, globose drupe that turns dark purple when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne novoguineensis is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the diverse tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in the lowland and hill forest regions. This plant thrives in humid and warm climates with high levels of precipitation. It is commonly encountered in the western and northern parts of New Guinea.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the unique ecological conditions of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne novoguineensis was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in lowland forests and is often found growing in shaded environments. This plant is commonly cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and fragrant leaves. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific habitat requirements and climate preferences.</p>
