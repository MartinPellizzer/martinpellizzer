                    <h1>Ambulia rigida var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Ambulia rigida var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved rigid ambulia, is a unique species characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is native to specific regions with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
