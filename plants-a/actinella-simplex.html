                <h1>Actinella simplex</h1>
<p>Actinella simplex, commonly known as the simple actinella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Asia and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella simplex has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a bluish-green upper surface and a pale underside, measuring approximately 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, slightly hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, with a structure consisting of five petals and five stamens, and it is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella simplex is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically occurring in parts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats such as hardwood forests and along stream banks. This plant is typically associated with rich, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with high humidity. It is often seen growing in the understory of forested environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Actinella simplex is relatively rare and localized in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella simplex was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been reported in various regions where it has established itself in disturbed soils and open areas. The plant's adaptability to different environmental conditions has contributed to its spread. It is often found in urban and rural settings where it can thrive with minimal care.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
