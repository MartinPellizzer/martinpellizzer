                <h1>Adonis transsilvanica</h1>
<p>Adonis transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian adonis, is a perennial herb native to the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in parts of Europe.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis transsilvanica has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are generally lanceolate or ovate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and slightly woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are yellow and consist of five petals arranged in a cup-shaped structure, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis transsilvanica is primarily native to the Carpathian Mountains region, spanning parts of Romania, Hungary, and Serbia.</p>
<p>It grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, typically on rocky slopes and in open woodland areas. This plant is found in elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with calcareous substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis transsilvanica was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread across various regions of the country. Although it is not considered a major invasive species, it has established populations in native grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant's ability to thrive in a range of soil types has contributed to its successful introduction and persistence.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to monitor its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
