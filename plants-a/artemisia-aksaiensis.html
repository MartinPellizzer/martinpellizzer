<p>Artemisia aksaiensis, commonly known as the Aksai Mountain wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a strong, camphor-like scent.

It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and chemical composition, it has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>
