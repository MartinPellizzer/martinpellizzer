                <h1>Adicea semidentata</h1>
<p>Adicea semidentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and thistles. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, with narrow, linear leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Adicea semidentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea semidentata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with five petals, bloom in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions by anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea semidentata is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Sudan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland forests and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often seen in secondary growth forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also reported in parts of Southeast Asia, though it is less common there compared to its African range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea semidentata was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. It has been introduced in several regions, including parts of the United States and Australia.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native environments.</p>
