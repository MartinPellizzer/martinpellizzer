<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidosasa hirtiflora has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, covered with fine, soft hairs, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with four petals of white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidosasa hirtiflora is a plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America, specifically found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has been largely restricted due to habitat loss, with the species now primarily occurring in protected areas. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical and subtropical forests. Acidosasa hirtiflora is typically found at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and threats from deforestation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
