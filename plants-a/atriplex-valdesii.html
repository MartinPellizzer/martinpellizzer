<p>Atriplex valdesii, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of greenish-yellow flowers, which are typically inconspicuous and borne in dense inflorescences. Atriplex valdesii is often found in sandy soils and is capable of tolerating high salinity levels.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for wildlife in desert ecosystems.</p>
