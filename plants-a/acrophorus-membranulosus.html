                <h1>Acrophorus membranulosus</h1>
<p>Acrophorus membranulosus, commonly known as the membranous acanthus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive membranous edge, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>The flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus membranulosus has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, featuring a tubular structure, and bloom during the rainy season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus membranulosus is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to these specific ecological zones within the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus membranulosus was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often spreading through human activities such as agriculture and land development. This plant has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, where it has established itself in natural and semi-natural environments. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities and ecosystem balance.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
