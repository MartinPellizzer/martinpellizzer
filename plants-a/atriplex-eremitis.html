<p>Atriplex eremitis, commonly known as shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Atriplex eremitis plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
