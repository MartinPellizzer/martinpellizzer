<p>Anthericum gambuense, commonly known as the African yellow flag, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow spathe and spadix inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, often dominating aquatic habitats.</p>
