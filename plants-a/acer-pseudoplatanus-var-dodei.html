                <h1>Acer pseudoplatanus var. dodei</h1>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. dodei, commonly known as the Dodei maple, is a variant of the common maple, characterized by its distinctive foliage and growth habits.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically reaches heights of 10 to 15 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, grey-barked trunk. The leaves are palmately lobed, usually with five to seven lobes, and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil with partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. dodei has broad, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in clustered inflorescences during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. dodei is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in Spain.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of Europe, including southern France and Italy, as a horticultural curiosity. This variant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils, typically found in forested areas and rocky slopes. It is usually found at elevations between 800 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and rarity in the wild, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. dodei is a striking maple variety known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique leaf shape.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering more reliable results. This species grows best in a temperate climate, entering a dormant phase in winter and actively growing during spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and prune in late winter to shape the tree and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or shrubs enhances its aesthetic appeal and supports a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. dodei is a unique variant of the maple tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing overall ecosystem stability. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in landscape restoration.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. dodei is a rare variant of the maple tree known primarily for its ornamental value in horticulture and landscaping due to its unique foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been occasionally explored for potential medicinal properties, though research is limited. In industrial and economic terms, it contributes to the forestry and timber industries in regions where it is cultivated. Culturally, it is valued as a symbol of biodiversity and conservation efforts in botanical gardens and protected areas.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological studies also highlights its importance in understanding genetic variation and adaptation in plant species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. dodei has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, such as 'Hippolyta' and 'Crimson King', which display striking foliage colors.</p>
<p>It is also involved in the creation of hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the diversity of ornamental maples in horticulture. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced growth habits, improved disease resistance, and a wider range of leaf colors. The varietal form is of particular horticultural importance due to its unique characteristics and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>
<p>Its use in landscaping highlights its significance in modern plant collections and urban green spaces.</p>
