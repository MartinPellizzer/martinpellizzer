                <h1>Achnatherum bromoides</h1>
<p>Achnatherum bromoides, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to the central and western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and compact growth habit, making it a common component of native grasslands. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in prairie and steppe ecosystems.</p>
<p>Blue grama plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum bromoides has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and range from 10 to 30 cm in length with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and cylindrical, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is typically clump-forming. Its flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous florets, with a pale greenish color, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the seeds are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor and spread in suitable habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum bromoides is primarily native to Albania, Bulgaria, Corse, Cyprus, East Aegean Is., France, Greece, Hungary, Iran, Iraq, Italy, Kriti, Krym, Lebanon-Syria, Morocco, North Caucasus, NW.</p>
<p>Balkan Pen., Palestine, Portugal, Romania, Sardegna, Sicilia, Spain, Transcaucasus, Turkey, and Turkey-in-Europe. This grass species is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky areas, and along coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with disturbed or semi-natural environments. Achnatherum bromoides is known for its ability to colonize a variety of soil types, contributing to ecological diversity in its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans across several Mediterranean and temperate regions, reflecting its adaptability to different environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum bromoides was mainly introduced to Germany.</p>
<p>It is a grass species that has been established in various habitats across the country. The introduction is likely due to its ornamental value and adaptability to different soil conditions. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
