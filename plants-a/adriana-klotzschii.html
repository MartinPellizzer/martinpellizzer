                <h1>Adriana klotzschii</h1>
<p>Adriana klotzschii, commonly known as the Adriana's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence.</p>
<p>Adriana klotzschii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adriana klotzschii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adriana klotzschii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant is commonly associated with steppes and semi-desert landscapes, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches, making it a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, Adriana klotzschii is considered a valuable indicator of the unique biodiversity of Central Asian ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adriana klotzschii was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It has also been reported in some areas of the Middle East and the Canary Islands. This plant is commonly found in rocky soils and coastal areas, often growing in sunny, well-drained environments. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in most of its current range.</p>
