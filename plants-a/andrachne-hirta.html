<p>Andrachne hirta, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy, greenish-white flowers. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Andrachne hirta is often found in sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
