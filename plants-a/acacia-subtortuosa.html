                        <h1>Acacia subtortuosa</h1>
<p>Acacia subtortuosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume pods and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features slender, often twisted branches and narrow, feathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. Its flowers are yellow and appear in clustered spikes, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>Acacia subtortuosa is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia subtortuosa is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops, savannas, and thornveld habitats where it thrives in dry conditions. This species is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a characteristic plant of the Namib Desert and surrounding areas. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is also sometimes cultivated in dryland regions for its ornamental and ecological value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia subtortuosa was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or loamy soils and a semi-arid to arid climate.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it suitable for degraded or disturbed lands. This plant is commonly used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has helped in reclaiming barren lands and promoting biodiversity in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
