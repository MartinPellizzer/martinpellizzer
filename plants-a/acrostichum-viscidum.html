                <h1>Acrostichum viscidum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum viscidum, commonly known as the sticky fern, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or near streams. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Acrostichum viscidum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum viscidum has large, compound leaves that are typically triangular in shape, with a dark green color and a waxy surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a clumping pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with separate male and female parts, blooming in the spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum viscidum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of rivers and lakes where the soil is consistently moist. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and coastal areas. It is also known to grow in disturbed soils and can be found in flooded lowlands.</p>
<p>Its native range extends from the Caribbean islands to northern South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum viscidum was mainly introduced to wetlands and coastal areas where it can thrive in saline and brackish water conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mangrove swamps and estuarine environments, often forming dense thickets that can alter local ecosystems. This plant is known for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and poor soil conditions, making it a successful invader in disturbed habitats. Its introduction has been documented in several regions, including parts of the southeastern United States and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns in some areas.</p>
