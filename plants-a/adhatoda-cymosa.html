                <h1>Adhatoda cymosa</h1>
<p>Adhatoda cymosa, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adhatoda cymosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda cymosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are pink to purple in color, with five petals and a tubular corolla, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, often forming a dense network near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda cymosa is primarily native to southern and eastern Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open woodlands, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of Africa, such as Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
<p>Adhatoda cymosa is often used in traditional medicine for its medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda cymosa was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and along riverbanks, particularly in the eastern and southern parts of the country. The plant is often seen growing in disturbed soils and open habitats, which allows it to spread easily. Its introduction has led to some concern due to its potential invasive tendencies in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional medicinal uses.</p>
