                    <h1>Androsace rhizomatosa</h1>
<p>Androsace rhizomatosa, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a dense network of rhizomes that help it spread and establish itself in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Androsace rhizomatosa is often found in meadows, grasslands, and mountainous regions where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
