                            <h1>Arachnorchis Serotina</h1>
<p>Arachnorchis serotina is a rare and striking orchid native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. Known for its unique, spider-like appearance, it features elongated, hairy sepals that resemble the legs of an arachnid. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy areas along the east coast. Its blooming season typically occurs in late winter or early spring, producing delicate pink or white flowers. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Arachnorchis serotina is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
