                <h1>Adicea atroviridis</h1>
<p>Adicea atroviridis, commonly known as the black-veined flax, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with dark green veins. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are typically found during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Adicea atroviridis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea atroviridis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea atroviridis is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and savanna habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. This plant prefers full sun to partial shade and is adapted to the dry, temperate climate of its native range. It is a perennial herb that can be found in various ecosystems across these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in similar climatic zones.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea atroviridis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 2000s in Oregon and Washington. The plant was likely introduced through contaminated soil or seed shipments from its native range in South America. It has since spread to moist, shaded areas along stream banks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its establishment has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
