<p>Alnus cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 3 to 6 inches long and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Alnus cordata is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life.</p>
