                <h1>Acer polycarpon</h1>
<p>Acer polycarpon, commonly known as the common maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which typically have five to seven lobes, and its bright red samaras that disperse in the wind. The tree thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy areas or along streams. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it produces flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>Acer polycarpon plays an important role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer polycarpon has alternate, palmately compound leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a light green color during the growing season and turning yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and the plant grows as a shrub or small tree. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer polycarpon is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of eastern North America, specifically from New York to Florida and westward to Texas.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of the world, including Europe, Asia, and Australia, due to human introduction. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland edges, stream banks, and wetlands. It typically grows at low to moderate elevations, ranging from sea level up to about 600 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is threatened by urbanization and land development, leading to a decline in its natural range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer polycarpon is a small deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can enhance its growth and health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer polycarpon is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its presence also supports biodiversity by creating microhabitats within its dense foliage.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer polycarpon contributes to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer polycarpon is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in industrial applications due to its hard wood, which is used in small-scale carpentry and furniture making. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, representing resilience and adaptability in natural environments. While not widely cultivated for economic gain, it contributes to local biodiversity and ecological stability.</p>
<p>Its role in scientific research also highlights its potential for future medicinal and ecological applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer polycarpon has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are of interest in horticulture.</p>
<p>Some popular cultivars include 'Variegatum' and 'Sutherlandii', which are valued for their striking foliage and ornamental features. While natural hybrids of Acer polycarpon are relatively rare, some horticulturists have attempted to cross it with other maple species to create unique specimens. These cultivars and hybrids are often appreciated for their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer polycarpon holds significant horticultural importance due to its potential for ornamental use and its role in botanical research.</p>
