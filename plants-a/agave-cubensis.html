<p>Agave cubensis, commonly known as the blue agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are blue-gray in color and form a rosette pattern. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing small greenish-white flowers. Its most notable feature is the core, or pi√±a, which is used to make tequila.</p>
<p>Agave cubensis is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stem.</p>
