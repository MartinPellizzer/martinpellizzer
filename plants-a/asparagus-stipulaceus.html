                    <h1>Asparagus stipulaceus</h1>
<p>Asparagus stipulaceus, commonly known as the desert asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a resilient plant suitable for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
