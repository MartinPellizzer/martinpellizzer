<p>Acacia holosericea var. multispirea, commonly known as the spiral acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spirally arranged phyllodes, which are narrow, linear, and often have a slight zigzag appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact globular inflorescences, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, reducing water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
