                    <h1>Astragalus leptophysus</h1>
<p>Astragalus leptophysus, commonly known as the slenderleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish-white flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species.</p>
