<p>Aspidium falcilobum, commonly known as the sickle-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating, pinnately divided fronds that resemble the shape of a sickle. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, which help in stabilizing the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically green and can vary in size depending on the environmental conditions.</p>
