                    <h1>Asplenium juglandifolium var. integerrimum</h1>
<p>Asplenium juglandifolium var. integerrimum, commonly known as the silver shield fern, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, silver-gray rhizomes and its compound, pinnately arranged fronds. The fronds are typically broad, with a waxy texture and a dark green color that contrasts with the silvery undersides. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
