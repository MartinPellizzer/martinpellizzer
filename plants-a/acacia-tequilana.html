                        <h1>Acacia tequilana</h1>
<p>Acacia tequilana, commonly known as the Mexican acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the dry regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and bipinnate leaves that are divided into many small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are used in traditional medicine and as a source of tannins.</p>
<p>Acacia tequilana is adapted to arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia tequilana is primarily native to the Mexican states of Jalisco, Guanajuato, and Michoac√°n.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of the southern United States, including Texas and New Mexico. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in limestone soils. It is commonly associated with the Tequila region, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Acacia tequilana is an important component of the vegetation in these regions, contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia tequilana was mainly introduced to Mexico, particularly in the state of Jalisco, where it is commonly found in the Tequila region.</p>
<p>It is cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of timber. The plant is also used in traditional medicine and as a component in the production of tequila. Its distribution has been expanded through horticultural practices and ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range.</p>
