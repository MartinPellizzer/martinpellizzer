<p>Acacia tequilana, commonly known as the Mexican acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the dry regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and bipinnate leaves that are divided into many small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are used in traditional medicine and as a source of tannins.</p>
<p>Acacia tequilana is adapted to arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
