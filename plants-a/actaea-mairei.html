                <h1>Actaea mairei</h1>
<p>Actaea mairei, commonly known as the Maire's bugbane, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by dark red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are deeply lobed.</p>
<p>Actaea mairei thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea mairei has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, typically reddish-brown in color, with a straight growth pattern. Its flowers are white and arranged in an upright panicle, blooming in late summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, berry-like structure containing small seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's propagation and survival in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea mairei is primarily native to the mountainous regions of China, specifically in the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often found in forested areas and among rocky terrain. This plant is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking, pale yellow flowers. It is commonly found in the Hengduan Mountains and other elevated regions of southwestern China.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, Actaea mairei is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea mairei was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant spreads through its rhizomes, making it difficult to control.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
