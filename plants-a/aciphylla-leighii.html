                <h1>Aciphylla leighii</h1>
<p>Aciphylla leighii, commonly known as the Leigh's tussock grass, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit with short, stiff leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal and alpine regions, where it forms low, compact clumps. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Aciphylla leighii is an important component of New Zealand's native vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla leighii has needle-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette, with a blue-gray coloration and a rough, waxy texture to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a greyish-brown bark that is smooth and shrub-like in growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in a panicle, with yellowish-green petals and a short blooming period in late spring, pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla leighii is primarily native to the South Island of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the alpine and subalpine regions, particularly in the mountainous areas of the South. This plant thrives in harsh environments with low temperatures and strong winds. It is often seen growing on rocky slopes and in open grasslands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the southern parts of New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla leighii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury region. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes and gravelly soils. It is often associated with coastal and inland dunes.</p>
<p>Aciphylla leighii is known for its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
