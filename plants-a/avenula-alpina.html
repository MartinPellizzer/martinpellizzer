                    <h1>Avenula alpina</h1>
<p>Avenula alpina, commonly known as alpine oat, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with white or pale blue flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive harsh winter conditions.</p>
<p>Avenula alpina plays an important role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems.</p>
