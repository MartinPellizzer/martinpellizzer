                            <h1>Astragalus Medicagineus Subsp. Expansus</h1>
<p>Expansive milkvetch, scientifically known as Astragalus medicagineus subsp. expansus, is a striking member of the legume family native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. This perennial plant is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers and robust, sprawling growth habit, making it a notable sight in its natural habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and open landscapes, often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Despite its beauty, the species is threatened by habitat loss and overgrazing, highlighting the need for conservation efforts. Its ecological importance as a food source for pollinators and grazing animals further underscores its value in maintaining biodiversity.</p>
