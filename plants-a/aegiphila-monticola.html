                <h1>Aegiphila monticola</h1>
<p>Aegiphila monticola, commonly known as the mountain aegiphila, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila monticola has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a rough, bark-like texture that is typically a muted brown or grayish color. Its flowers are clustered in dense spikes, featuring tubular structures with purple to violet petals, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
