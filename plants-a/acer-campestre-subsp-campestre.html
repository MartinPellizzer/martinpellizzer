<p>campestre, commonly known as the field maple, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters, with a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>The leaves are palmately lobed, usually with five to seven segments, and turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre subsp.</p>
<p>campestre has ovate to elliptical leaves that are alternate in arrangement, typically ranging from 3 to 7 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, turning yellow to orange in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading habit.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in cymes, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to well-drained soils and providing stability to the plant.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre subsp.</p>
<p>campestre is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to western and central Europe, including parts of the British Isles, France, and Spain. Its current distribution has expanded due to human activity, and it is now found across much of Europe, including parts of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in a variety of environments, such as hedgerows, woodland edges, and rocky soils, often in sunny to partially shaded areas. This species typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to around 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>It is considered a least concern species by the IUCN, as it is widespread and relatively common in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre subsp.</p>
<p>campestre is a hardy, small to medium-sized maple tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability. It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or layering, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle includes a slow to moderate growth rate, with new shoots emerging in spring and foliage developing throughout the summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended for optimal health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
