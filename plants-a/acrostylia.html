<p>Acrostylia, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, and they are characterized by their striking, velvety leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are soft to the touch, giving the plant its common name. Acrostylia species are often used in ornamental horticulture for their attractive foliage and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates.</p>
