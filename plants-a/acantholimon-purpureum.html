                        <h1>Acantholimon purpureum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon purpureum, commonly known as the purple saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces vivid purple or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon purpureum is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and coastal areas, often growing in dry, sunny environments. This plant thrives in regions with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. It is particularly common in countries such as Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and Turkey.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with limestone and calcareous substrates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon purpureum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and gravelly slopes. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with Mediterranean-type ecosystems. Its introduction has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
