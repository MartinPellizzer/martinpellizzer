                    <h1>Axonopus passourae</h1>
<p>Axonopus passourae, commonly known as the coastal axonopus, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing tufts of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a mat-like structure. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it helps stabilize the soil and prevent erosion. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind or water.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
