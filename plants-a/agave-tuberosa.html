                    <h1>Agave tuberosa</h1>
<p>Agave tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage composed of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often lined with white marginal teeth. The plant produces a tall, branching inflorescence that bears yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by small, fleshy fruits. Its roots are tuberous, allowing it to store water and nutrients, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Agave tuberosa is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
