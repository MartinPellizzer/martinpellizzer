<p>Arctium stenocephalum, commonly known as the narrow-headed burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, spherical seed heads that develop after flowering.</p>
<p>These seed heads aid in wind dispersal, allowing the plant to spread effectively in various habitats.</p>
