                    <h1>Argemone arenicola</h1>
<p>Argemone arenicola, commonly known as the desert castor or sand castor, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed or open habitats. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with five petals, followed by spiny capsules containing oily seeds. Its thick, waxy leaves help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>The seeds are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though the plant contains toxic compounds that require careful handling.</p>
