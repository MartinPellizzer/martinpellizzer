                    <h1>Aconitum villosum var. rectiusculum</h1>
<p>Aconitum villosum var. rectiusculum, commonly known as the woolly monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features showy, hooded blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a tall, unbranched stem covered in soft, white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that are also hairy.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other Aconitum species and is valued in gardens for its ornamental value despite its toxic properties.</p>
