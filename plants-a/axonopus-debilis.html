                    <h1>Axonopus debilis</h1>
<p>Axonopus debilis, commonly known as slender axonopus, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of fine, hair-like leaves that are often less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. Axonopus debilis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and establish itself in disturbed or waterlogged soils.</p>
