<p>Aria avonensis, commonly known as Avon's arrowhead, is a rare aquatic plant native to the UK.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. The plant has slender, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the mud. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
