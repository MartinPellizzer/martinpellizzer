                    <h1>Atraphaxis kamelinii</h1>
<p>Atraphaxis kamelinii, commonly known as the desert sandburs, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features small, spiny fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal, a common strategy in its harsh environment. The plant has gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. It thrives in sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native habitats.</p>
