<p>Asplenium glabratum, commonly known as the smooth spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>

The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are smooth and glossy. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium glabratum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care.</p>
