<p>Agrostophyllum ventricosum, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in Australia.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are red when mature. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for native birds and insects, and its presence can indicate the health of the host tree.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
