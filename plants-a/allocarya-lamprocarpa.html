                    <h1>Allocarya lamprocarpa</h1>
<p>Allocarya lamprocarpa, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that reflect light and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by parachute-like seeds for wind dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
