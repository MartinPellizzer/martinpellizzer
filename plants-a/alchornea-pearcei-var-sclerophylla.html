                    <h1>Alchornea pearcei var. sclerophylla</h1>
<p>Alchornea pearcei var. sclerophylla, commonly known as the roughleaf alchornea, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of local ecosystems.</p>
