                <h1>Adenophora rupincola</h1>
<p>Adenophora rupincola, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple. The plant has hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Adenophora rupincola is often found in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to cooler, high-altitude environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora rupincola has compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with ovate to elliptic leaflets that are medium in size, ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and have a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, with white petals and a prominent central gland, blooming in summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora rupincola is primarily native to China South-Central and China Southeast.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils. It thrives in mountainous areas and is often associated with forest edges or open meadows. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>
<p>Adenophora rupincola is an important component of the local flora in these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora rupincola was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full to partial sunlight. This plant is commonly found in parts of East Asia, including China and Korea. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has established itself in several non-native environments outside its original range.</p>
