                    <h1>Aechmea nudicaulis var. capitata</h1>
<p>Aechmea nudicaulis var. capitata, commonly known as the "Pineapple Plant" or "Little Pineapple," is a striking bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its compact size and ornamental appeal.</p>
