<p>Ajuga glabrescens, commonly known as narrowleaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, blooming in early to mid-summer.

<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick, carpet-like colonies.</p>
