<p>Acmella alba, commonly known as the "pennywort," is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a useful and potentially invasive species in certain environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella alba has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually bright green, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, herbaceous, and typically has a light green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, yellow, and borne in clusters, with a distinctive central disk and petal-like rays, blooming from late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that contains small, white seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in open areas, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Acmella alba is often associated with wetlands and lowland habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions in South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella alba was mainly introduced to Jawa.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to South America but has been introduced to various regions, including Jawa. The plant is commonly found in wetland areas and along the edges of ponds and streams. It is known for its bright yellow flowers and is often used in ornamental gardening.</p>
