                <h1>Adiantopsis propinqua</h1>
<p>Adiantopsis propinqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shaded garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantopsis propinqua has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feather-like appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure around 10-15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers with a single stamen and pistil, typically blooming in early spring, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizoidal, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantopsis propinqua is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically Texas and parts of Oklahoma.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky or sandy soils in open, sunlit areas. This fern thrives in dry, arid environments and is often seen growing on rock faces or in rocky crevices. It is a rare and endemic species, with a limited geographic range.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantopsis propinqua was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. This fern is known for its delicate, lace-like fronds and ability to thrive in humid conditions. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>The plant's introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on native flora.</p>
