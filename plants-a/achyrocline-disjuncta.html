<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils. It produces showy purple to pink flowers that bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline disjuncta has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they range in size from 3 to 8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered with fine hairs, and has a brownish color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
