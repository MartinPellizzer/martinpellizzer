                <h1>Acoridium ocellatum</h1>
<p>Acoridium ocellatum, commonly known as the spotted arum, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves and striking inflorescence. The plant features a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, which is typical of the arum family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Acoridium ocellatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium ocellatum has narrow, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, typically ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length and 1 to 2 centimeters in width, with a bright green color and a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a rough, bark-like texture that is usually dark brown in color, and it grows upright from the base of the rosette. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in a loose cluster, with three petals and three sepals, blooming in the spring and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium ocellatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. This plant is also known to occur in parts of Madagascar and the Comoros Islands. It prefers well-drained soils and is commonly associated with wetlands and swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium ocellatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in wetlands and forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes have raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
