                <h1>Acer pictum subsp. pictum</h1>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>pictum, commonly known as the painted maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking foliage, which turns brilliant red, orange, and yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The leaves are palmately lobed with finely serrated edges and a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside. It typically grows to a height of 15–30 feet and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>pictum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green or sometimes reddish underside. The stem is smooth and slender, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes furrowed with age, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in clusters, with yellowish-green petals, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>pictum is a rare, small tree native to the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States, primarily found in Tennessee and North Carolina. While its native range was once broader, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Cumberland Plateau.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments within mixed hardwood forests. This species typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>pictum is a striking maple known for its vibrant red foliage and compact growth, making it a popular ornamental plant. It can be propagated through seed or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle involves slow, steady development, with new growth emerging in early spring and foliage turning red in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the plant and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or groundcovers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a healthy garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>pictum is a native deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and promoting the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing stream banks and slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and offers aesthetic and ecological benefits to forest habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>pictum is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, known for its striking red and orange foliage. While it is primarily valued for its ornamental beauty in gardens and landscapes, it has limited direct culinary use.</p>
<p>Historically, indigenous communities may have used parts of the tree for medicinal purposes, though specific applications are not well documented. The tree plays a role in ecological systems by providing habitat and food for wildlife.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes the changing seasons and is often featured in local art and literature.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>pictum has several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson King' and 'Orange Glow', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habit. It also has natural hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the genetic diversity within the genus.</p>
<p>These cultivars and hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions. Their ability to thrive in different climates makes them a popular choice for landscapers and gardeners. Overall, Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>pictum plays an important role in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic value and versatility.</p>
