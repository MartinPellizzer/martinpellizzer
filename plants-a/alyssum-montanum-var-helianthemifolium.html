<p>Alyssum montanum var. helianthemifolium, commonly known as the goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is closely related to other alyssum species and shares similar ecological adaptations.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
