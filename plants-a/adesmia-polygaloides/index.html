                            <h1>Adesmia Polygaloides</h1>
<p>Bluebonnet, scientifically known as Adesmia polygaloides, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It is best recognized for its vibrant blue and purple blooms that appear in the spring. This species thrives in open, sunny areas such as prairies and roadsides, often becoming a symbol of the Texas landscape. The plant's name comes from the French "blue bonnet," referencing its striking color and traditional headwear. Despite its beauty, it faces threats from habitat loss and invasive species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
