                <h1>Acer × avilae</h1>
<p>Acer × avilae, commonly known as the mapleleaf maple, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Sapindaceae family.</p>
<p>It is known for its striking ornamental value, featuring vibrant autumn foliage that ranges from yellow to red. The tree typically grows to a height of 10–15 meters, with a broad, rounded crown. Its leaves are palmately lobed, resembling those of other maple species, and are typically 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The plant is native to the eastern United States and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × avilae has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow vertical fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, with two papery wings that aid in wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous, adapting to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × avilae is a hybrid maple species native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, specifically in the provinces of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in these areas, its current distribution includes cultivation in gardens and botanical collections across Asia, Europe, and North America. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil, typically growing in forested areas or along stream banks. This species is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin and limited natural range, Acer × avilae is considered to be of low conservation concern, though its wild populations are not well documented.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × avilae is a hybrid maple tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Acer × avilae involves a period of rapid growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer × avilae is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring blossoms and serves as a habitat for numerous animals throughout the year. The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed-species forests, enhancing biodiversity and ecological stability. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality, offering significant ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer × avilae is a hybrid maple tree known for its ornamental value and use in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and growth habits.</p>
