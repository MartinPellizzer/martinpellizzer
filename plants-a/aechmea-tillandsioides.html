<p>Aechmea tillandsioides, commonly known as the silver vanda, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's hydration. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its foliage is usually covered in a dense layer of white or silver hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>

<p>The stem is short and sturdy, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upward from the base of the plant. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, spike-like structure bearing small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by birds and insects. The plant produces berries that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
