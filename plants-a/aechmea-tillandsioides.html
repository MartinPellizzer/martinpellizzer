<p>Aechmea tillandsioides, commonly known as the silver vanda, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's hydration. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its foliage is usually covered in a dense layer of white or silver hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
