<p>Aegilops speltoides, commonly known as false wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, two-lobed florets, which are typically green or pale in color. It is a perennial species that thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Aegilops speltoides is of interest to researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
