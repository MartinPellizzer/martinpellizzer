                <h1>Aegilops speltoides</h1>
<p>Aegilops speltoides, commonly known as false wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, two-lobed florets, which are typically green or pale in color. It is a perennial species that thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Aegilops speltoides is of interest to researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops speltoides has narrow, grass-like leaves that are mostly parallel-veined, with a bluish-green color and a flat, upright arrangement.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and smooth, with a light green to reddish-brown color, and it grows in a spreading or clumping pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous, greenish flowers that bloom in early summer and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, and the seeds are small and hard.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
