                <h1>Adenocalymma gibbosum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma gibbosum, commonly known as the globe-headed rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features dense, rounded clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the harsh coastal environment.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma gibbosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma gibbosum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light grey bark that remains relatively unbranched until later stages of growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the surrounding soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma gibbosum is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, particularly in the states of SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and lowland regions. Adenocalymma gibbosum is commonly associated with sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open vegetation.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Brazil's southeastern states.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma gibbosum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along waterways.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban settings. This plant is often found in the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, and Texas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds contribute to its invasive potential in new regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can outcompete native vegetation, altering local ecosystems.</p>
