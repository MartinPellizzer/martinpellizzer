                        <h1>Acanthus hispanicus</h1>
<p>Acanthus hispanicus, commonly known as the Spanish acanthus, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features striking, palmate leaves with deep lobes and spiny margins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems with clusters of small, violet-blue flowers in the summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its architectural form and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthus hispanicus is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is particularly associated with the Iberian Peninsula, where it grows in dry, sunny environments. It is also present in regions such as southern France, Italy, and the Balearic Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, but its native range remains largely within the Mediterranean basin.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthus hispanicus was mainly introduced to ornamental gardening and landscaping due to its striking, palmate leaves and showy, spiny flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in regions with temperate climates, particularly in Europe and North America. The plant is often used in garden design to add visual interest and texture to borders, rock gardens, and containers. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not properly managed.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to outcompete native plant species in natural habitats.</p>
