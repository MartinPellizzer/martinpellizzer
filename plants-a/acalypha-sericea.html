                        <h1>Acalypha sericea</h1>
<p>Acalypha sericea, commonly known as silverleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Acalypha sericea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha sericea belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of a true root system and a complex life cycle involving both sexual and asexual reproduction. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and some modern gymnosperms. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as roses and magnolias.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants known for their diverse morphological features and ecological adaptations. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with a wide range of growth forms and some containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupids," characterized by their showy flowers and often hairy foliage.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha sericea, a specific type within the genus Acalypha, distinguished by its silky-haired leaves and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha sericea is primarily native to the Galápagos.</p>
<p>It is found in the volcanic islands of the Galápagos archipelago, which is located in the eastern Pacific Ocean. This plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, often in disturbed or open habitats. It is adapted to the unique climate and soil conditions of the Galápagos.</p>
<p>Acalypha sericea plays a role in the local ecosystem and is part of the island's distinctive flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha sericea was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become established in various habitats, including coastal areas and disturbed soils. Although it is not considered invasive, it has spread beyond its original cultivation sites. The plant is often found in gardens and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution in New Zealand is limited compared to its native range in Southeast Asia.</p>
