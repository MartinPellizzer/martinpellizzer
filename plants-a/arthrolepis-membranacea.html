                    <h1>Arthrolepis membranacea</h1>
<p>Arthrolepis membranacea, commonly known as the membranous arthrolepis, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring or early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
