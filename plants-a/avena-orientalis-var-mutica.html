<p>Avena orientalis var. mutica, commonly known as the soft oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and ecological adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations.</p>
