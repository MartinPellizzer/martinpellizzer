                <h1>Acer pensylvanicum subsp. capillipes</h1>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum subsp.</p>
<p>capillipes, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive red foliage in the fall and its showy, red flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically ovate with finely toothed margins, and the bark is smooth and grayish-brown when young. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to other red maple varieties but is distinguished by its unique leaf and flower characteristics.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum subsp.</p>
<p>capillipes has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length, with a shallowly divided shape and a bright green upper surface that turns yellow or red in autumn. The stems are slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops vertical fissures as the plant matures.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, arranged in upright clusters, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum subsp.</p>
<p>capillipes is a rare, small deciduous tree native to the northeastern United States, specifically found in New York, Pennsylvania, and western Vermont. While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few scattered locations, primarily in moist, acidic soils of mature forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing in the understory of mixed hardwood forests. This species is found at elevations ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is listed as endangered or critically endangered in several states, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum subsp.</p>
<p>capillipes is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and unique, slender leaves. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification to break dormancy.</p>
<p>This species has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils with consistent moisture. Minimal fertilization is needed, and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or heathers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum subsp.</p>
<p>capillipes is a native shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, red flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil health. Its dense growth also helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in moist, shaded areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum subsp.</p>
<p>capillipes is a native North American tree known for its ecological importance as a habitat and food source for various wildlife species. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its wood has been historically valued for small woodworking projects due to its fine texture and workability.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, some indigenous communities have used parts of the tree for its potential healing properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Culturally, it holds significance in certain regions as a symbol of resilience and local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its role in forest ecosystems underscores its importance in maintaining ecological balance and supporting native flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum subsp.</p>
<p>capillipes has several popular cultivars such as 'Autumn Flame' and 'Red Baron', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habit. It is also frequently used in hybridization with other maples to create cultivars with enhanced ornamental traits.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and extended blooming periods, making them more adaptable to a range of climates. The horticultural importance of this subspecies lies in its ability to thrive in partial shade and its contribution to the diversity of ornamental maples in landscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and ecological value further enhance its appeal in both garden and natural settings.</p>
