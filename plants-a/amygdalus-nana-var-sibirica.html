                    <h1>Amygdalus nana var. sibirica</h1>
<p>Amygdalus nana var. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian dwarf almond, is a compact shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, oval leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart drupes. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
