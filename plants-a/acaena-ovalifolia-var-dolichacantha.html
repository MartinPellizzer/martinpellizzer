                    <h1>Acaena ovalifolia var. dolichacantha</h1>
<p>Acaena ovalifolia var. dolichacantha, commonly known as the long-stemmed prostrate acacia, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, spiny fruits containing seeds. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often forming dense mats on the ground.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
