                    <h1>Artia coriacea</h1>
<p>Artia coriacea, commonly known as the rough artia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Artia coriacea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
