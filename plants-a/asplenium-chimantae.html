                    <h1>Asplenium chimantae</h1>
<p>Asplenium chimantae, commonly known as the Chimant√° spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the humid forests of northern South America, particularly in Venezuela and Colombia. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the leaves, a characteristic feature of many ferns.</p>
<p>Asplenium chimantae is notable for its ecological role in forest understories and its contribution to biodiversity in tropical rainforests.</p>
