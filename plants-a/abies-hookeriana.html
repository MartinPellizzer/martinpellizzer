                        <h1>Abies hookeriana</h1>
<p>Abies hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's fir, is a species of fir native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in high-altitude forests, often in humid and cool climates. The tree has needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged spirally along the branches. Its cones are usually pendulous and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies hookeriana is primarily native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tibet.</p>
<p>It grows in high-altitude areas, typically between 2,500 and 4,500 meters above sea level. This species is commonly found in subalpine and alpine forests, often in association with other coniferous trees. It is well adapted to the cold, moist climate and rocky soils of its native habitat.</p>
<p>The plant is also known as the Hooker's fir and is named in honor of the British botanist William Hooker.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies hookeriana was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in areas with high elevation and cool, moist climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions such as the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impact and habitat disruption.</p>
