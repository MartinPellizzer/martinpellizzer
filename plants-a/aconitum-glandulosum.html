                <h1>Aconitum glandulosum</h1>
<p>Aconitum glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has dark green, deeply lobed leaves with a rough, hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Aconitum glandulosum contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum glandulosum has leaves that are compound, consisting of 5-7 ovate to elliptical leaflets, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, with a greenish-gray bark that becomes rough and fissured as the plant matures. The flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense, tall spires, each flower having five petals and a short, hooded calyx, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and survival in various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum glandulosum is primarily native to Altay, Buryatiya, Chita, Kazakhstan, Krasnoyarsk, Mongolia, Tuva, West Siberia, and Xinjiang.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions across these areas. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky soils and meadows. It is well adapted to the cold climates of its native range.</p>
<p>This species is part of the buttercup family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum glandulosum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native habitats. The plant competes with native species for resources, threatening local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
