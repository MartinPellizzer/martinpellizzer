                            <h1>Agropyron Cristatum Var. Hirsutissimum</h1>
<p>Agropyron cristatum var. hirsutissimum is a hardy grass species native to the cold climates of northern regions. It is known for its distinctive tufted growth and dense, hairy foliage that helps it survive harsh winter conditions. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as tundras and alpine meadows. Its ability to withstand extreme temperatures makes it an important component of ecosystems in polar and subarctic zones. Due to its resilience, it is also used in restoration projects and as a forage crop in certain regions.</p>
