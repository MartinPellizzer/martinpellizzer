                <h1>Acrostichum furfuraceum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum furfuraceum, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and wetlands. Its fronds are usually long and narrow, with a rough, textured surface.</p>
<p>Acrostichum furfuraceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum furfuraceum has large, feather-like leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green color and a rough, textured surface.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a rough, bark-like texture that is typically light to medium brown in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, with a greenish-white color, blooming during the summer months and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds through wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum furfuraceum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in lowland forests and swampy areas. This plant is commonly associated with mangrove ecosystems and coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its natural range extends to parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands as well.</p>
<p>Acrostichum furfuraceum is an important component of the wetland flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum furfuraceum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and disturbed soils, often along coastlines or in wetlands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high rainfall and moderate temperatures, such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and northern Australia. This plant thrives in coastal dunes and mangrove swamps, where it can tolerate salt spray and periodic flooding. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land clearing and the establishment of coastal infrastructure.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it has been introduced.</p>
