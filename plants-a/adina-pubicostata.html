                <h1>Adina pubicostata</h1>
<p>Adina pubicostata, commonly known as the hairy adina, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow and are arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, berry-like structure that turns red when mature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina pubicostata has alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically 2-5 cm long, dark green on top, and pale underneath, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody, with a pale green to brownish bark that peels in thin layers. The flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina pubicostata is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>While its native range is well-documented, its current distribution has been largely restricted due to habitat loss and degradation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. This plant typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Adina pubicostata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adina pubicostata is a shrub native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in warm climates and reaching maturity within several years.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant and encourage bushier growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adina pubicostata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit offers shelter and nesting sites for small mammals and birds, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat. It acts as a companion plant in some agricultural settings, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Adina pubicostata also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants.</p>
