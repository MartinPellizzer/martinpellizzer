                <h1>Adina pubicostata</h1>
<p>Adina pubicostata, commonly known as the hairy adina, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are hairy on both sides, giving it a distinctive texture. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow and are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina pubicostata has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina pubicostata is primarily native to China Southeast and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and undergrowth. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic locations.</p>
<p>The plant is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina pubicostata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This plant has been observed spreading into native habitats, potentially outcompeting local flora. Its introduction is believed to be through human activity, such as landscaping and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is now monitored in several conservation areas.</p>
