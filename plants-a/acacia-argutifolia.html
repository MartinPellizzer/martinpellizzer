                    <h1>Acacia argutifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia argutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its woody pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Acacia argutifolia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
