                    <h1>Acer giraldii</h1>
<p>Acer giraldii, commonly known as the Italian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its finely toothed, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, Acer giraldii is often cultivated in temperate climates.</p>
