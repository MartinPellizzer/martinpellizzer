<p>Adiantum alarconianum, commonly known as the Alarc√≥n maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>

The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Adiantum alarconianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
