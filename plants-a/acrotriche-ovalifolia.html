                <h1>Acrotriche ovalifolia</h1>
<p>Acrotriche ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved acrotriche, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in dense inflorescences. Acrotriche ovalifolia is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, adapting well to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental potential and has been studied for its potential ecological roles in coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotriche ovalifolia has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, have four petals, and bloom in spring, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche ovalifolia is primarily native to the Caribbean region, specifically the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and the Cayman Islands. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche ovalifolia was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly substrates and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. This plant is commonly associated with maritime climates and can tolerate salt spray. It has been reported in several coastal regions of the United States and parts of Australia.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
