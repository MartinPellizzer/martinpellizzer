                    <h1>Atroxima zenkeri</h1>
<p>Atroxima zenkeri, commonly known as the giant African snail, is a large terrestrial gastropod belonging to the family Achatinidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heavy, spirally twisted shell that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant-like appearance of its shell has led to its classification in the botanical realm, though it is not a true plant. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its size and ecological impact, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
