                <h1>Adenocalymma grenadense</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma grenadense, commonly known as the Grenada adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to the island of Grenada in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma grenadense has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are typically green and vary in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small and clustered, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma grenadense is primarily native to the island of Grenada in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is found in the moist, tropical forest environments of the island. This plant typically grows in the understorey of dense vegetation. It is adapted to the warm and humid climate of the region.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific areas within Grenada's natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma grenadense was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Louisiana, as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Although it is non-invasive in its native range, it has been observed spreading in some areas where it is not native, raising concerns about its ecological impact. The plant is often cultivated for its striking red flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a popular choice for gardeners in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
