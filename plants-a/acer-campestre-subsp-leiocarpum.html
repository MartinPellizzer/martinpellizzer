                        <h1>Acer campestre subsp. leiocarpum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre subsp.</p>
<p>leiocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-leaf horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its oval, glossy, dark green leaves that remain smooth and hairless on both sides.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by spiny, orange-brown fruits. Its bark is typically smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens.</p>

<p>leiocarpum belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that typically have separate male and female flowers and a well-developed vascular system. Its order is Sapindales, which includes a variety of flowering plants, many of which are known for their showy flowers and economically important fruits. Its family is Sapindaceae, commonly known as the soapberry family, which includes trees and shrubs with often fragrant flowers and fleshy fruits. Its genus is Acer, which consists of deciduous trees and shrubs commonly known as maples, characterized by their opposite leaves and samaroid fruits.</p>
