                <h1>Acer oblongum var. itoanum</h1>
<p>Acer oblongum var. itoanum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ornamental foliage, which displays vibrant colors during the growing season and in autumn. The leaves are typically oval or elliptical, with a serrated margin and a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. itoanum has palmately compound leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface that turns red in autumn.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, which are slender and somewhat woody with a smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and arranged in clusters. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. itoanum is a rare maple variety native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Japan, specifically in Honshu and Shikoku.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in the forests of the Japanese archipelago. It thrives in moist, temperate environments with partial shade, often found in mixed hardwood forests. This species typically grows at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer oblongum var. itoanum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. itoanum is a unique maple variety known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The growth cycle of this plant involves a dormant phase in winter and active growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. itoanum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers. Its dense canopy acts as a companion plant, offering shade and habitat in mixed forest ecosystems. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil quality and supporting biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. itoanum is a lesser-known variant of the maple tree that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in traditional medicine for its leaves and bark, which are believed to have anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in industrial applications, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports ecological balance in its native habitats. In cultural contexts, it may hold symbolic significance in regional folklore or as a marker of local identity. Its role in landscaping and ornamental horticulture also adds to its ecological and aesthetic value in urban and suburban environments.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications remain largely niche, focusing on ecological and traditional uses rather than large-scale economic exploitation.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. itoanum has several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson Queen' and 'Orange Queen', which are prized for their vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It is also commonly used in hybridization with other maple species to create ornamental varieties with enhanced color and growth habits. These hybrids often exhibit improved hardiness and adaptability to different climates. The cultivars and hybrids of this variety hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>They are widely cultivated for their ornamental appeal and contribute to the diversity of maple trees in horticulture.</p>
