<p>Athyrium uniseriatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mountain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Athyrium uniseriatum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
