                    <h1>Agropyron caninum f. ciliatum</h1>
<p>Agropyron caninum f. ciliatum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves with fine, silky hairs along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control.</p>
