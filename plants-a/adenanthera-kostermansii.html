                <h1>Adenanthera kostermansii</h1>
<p>Adenanthera kostermansii, commonly known as the African burr bean, is a small shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive burr-like seed pods. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spiny pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates.</p>
<p>The seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthera kostermansii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and reddish-brown in color, with a branching growth pattern that forms a shrub-like structure. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are taproots with lateral branches, enabling the plant to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera kostermansii is primarily native to Borneo and the Philippines.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical regions of these areas, where it thrives in humid and warm climates. It is commonly associated with lowland and hill forest environments. The plant is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is often found in secondary growth areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic regions, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera kostermansii was mainly introduced to specific regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland.</p>
<p>It was introduced for its ornamental value due to its attractive yellow flowers and ability to thrive in arid conditions. The plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it has become naturalized. It is considered a weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
