                        <h1>Acer loscosii</h1>
<p>Acer loscosii, commonly known as the Loscosii maple, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique foliage, it is highly sought after by horticulturists and botanists.</p>
