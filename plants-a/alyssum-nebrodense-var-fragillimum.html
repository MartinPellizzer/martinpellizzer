<p>Alyssum nebrodense var. fragillimum, commonly known as the fragilliform alpine alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and hardy nature make it a valuable addition to botanical collections and ecological studies.</p>
