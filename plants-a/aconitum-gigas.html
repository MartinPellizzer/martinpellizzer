                <h1>Aconitum gigas</h1>
<p>Aconitum gigas, commonly known as the giant monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears distinctive helmet-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are large, deeply lobed, and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its dramatic appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum gigas is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and contains toxic alkaloids, making it both beautiful and dangerous.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum gigas has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, dark green on top, and pale underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and clustered in racemes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum gigas is primarily native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in Honshu, Hokkaido, and Kyushu. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments such as forested areas and rocky slopes. It is commonly found at higher elevations where the climate is more temperate.</p>
<p>Aconitum gigas is an important part of the local flora and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of Japan.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum gigas was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade in the 19th century.</p>
<p>It was initially cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking blue-purple flowers. Despite its beauty, it has since become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora. Its spread has been facilitated by its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its population and prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
