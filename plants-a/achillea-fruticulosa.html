                <h1>Achillea fruticulosa</h1>
<p>Achillea fruticulosa, commonly known as yellow archangel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea fruticulosa has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a gray-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark, growing in a compact, bushy form. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene, with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea fruticulosa is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including North America and Australia. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and open woodlands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, it is not considered threatened and is classified as a species of least concern by conservation organizations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea fruticulosa is a hardy, flowering perennial known for its vibrant yellow blooms and drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds directly into the garden in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering occurring in the spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, though it benefits from occasional deep watering during dry spells. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourages new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea enhances its beauty and benefits from shared pest deterrence.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea fruticulosa is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by improving soil conditions. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil in sandy or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea fruticulosa contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and maintaining the health of local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea fruticulosa is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, known for its ornamental value and various practical applications.</p>
<p>In culinary use, its flowers can be used to make herbal teas and may add a subtle flavor to dishes.
