                    <h1>Agropyron sikkimense</h1>
<p>Agropyron sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that reflects its adaptation to cold climates.</p>
<p>Agropyron sikkimense is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and its potential use in forage and erosion control.</p>
