                    <h1>Agropyron semicostatum var. transiens</h1>
<p>Agropyron semicostatum var. transiens, commonly known as the Transverse needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it plays an important role in ecological restoration projects.</p>
