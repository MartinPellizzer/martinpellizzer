<p>Acinodendron centrophorum, commonly known as the central African starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and Southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped fruits, which are typically yellow when ripe. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in axillary or terminal inflorescences.</p>
<p>The fruit is edible, with a sweet and tangy flavor, making it a valuable resource in local cuisines.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron centrophorum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and helping it absorb nutrients from the arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron centrophorum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in both primary and secondary forests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron centrophorum was mainly introduced to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It is believed to have been brought there by ancient traders who visited the region. The plant is now considered a native species on Socotra, having become well established in the local ecosystem. It thrives in the arid and semi-arid conditions of the island.</p>
