                <h1>Adiantum dichotomum</h1>
<p>Adiantum dichotomum, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds that split into two equal parts, giving it a fan-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found growing in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with a dense mat of roots that help anchor it to trees or rocks. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a velvety texture that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Adiantum dichotomum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum dichotomum has fern-like leaves that are bipinnate, with a delicate, lacey appearance, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, measuring up to 20 cm in length, and have a light green color with a slightly glossy surface. The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. This plant does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-bearing plant, and instead reproduces via sporangia located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum dichotomum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, India, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in moist, shaded environments like forests and rocky outcrops. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often associated with mountainous areas. It is also native to parts of Japan and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to these geographic regions due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum dichotomum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses where it is cultivated for its aesthetic value. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it suitable for woodland gardens or shaded rockeries. Although it is non-native to most regions where it is grown, it has become naturalized in some areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems if it spreads beyond controlled environments.</p>
