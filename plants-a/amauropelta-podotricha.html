<p>Amauropelta podotricha, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
