                <h1>Adelobotrys acreanus</h1>
<p>Adelobotrys acreanus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that turn red when mature, containing a single seed. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>Adelobotrys acreanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys acreanus has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are typically 2-5 cm in length, dark green in color, and have a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright with a spreading habit. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys acreanus is primarily native to Brazil North and Peru.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in humid, lowland areas with rich soil. Adelobotrys acreanus is commonly associated with forest understories and shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Brazil and Peru.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys acreanus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as accidental transport via contaminated soil or equipment.</p>
<p>It has been observed in regions with disturbed soils and moist environments, often near human settlements. This plant has shown a preference for tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in areas with high humidity. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common invasive species in several regions outside its native range.</p>
