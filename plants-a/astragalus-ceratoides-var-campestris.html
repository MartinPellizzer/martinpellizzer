                    <h1>Astragalus ceratoides var. campestris</h1>
<p>Astragalus ceratoides var. campestris, commonly known as the field milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
