<p>Anisopappus annuus, commonly known as the annual goldenweed, is an herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant has alternate, linear leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy conditions.</p>
