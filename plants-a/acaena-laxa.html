<p>Acaena laxa, commonly known as the slender weed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its soft, hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Native to South America, it is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an adaptable and persistent weed in various environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena laxa is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found throughout the country, particularly in the South Island. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is commonly associated with the alpine and subalpine zones.</p>
<p>Acaena laxa is an important component of New Zealand's native flora and is often found in open, sunny environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena laxa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the European flora during the early colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in open forests, shrublands, and along roadsides.</p>
