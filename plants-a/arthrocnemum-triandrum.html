                    <h1>Arthrocnemum triandrum</h1>
<p>Arthrocnemum triandrum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its branches. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Arthrocnemum triandrum plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is adapted to extreme temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
