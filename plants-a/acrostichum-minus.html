<p>Acrostichum minus, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its ability to form dense clumps. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a finely divided structure that gives the plant a delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in humid, tropical habitats.</p>
