                        <h1>Acca velutina</h1>
<p>Acca velutina, commonly known as the velvet apple or cherimoya, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its fuzzy, greenish-brown skin that resembles velvet. The plant produces large, fragrant fruits with a creamy, sweet flesh that contains numerous black seeds. Its leaves are large, broad, and lobed, often with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acca velutina thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acca velutina is primarily native to South America, specifically found in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in humid lowland areas. This plant is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. It is also present in parts of Uruguay and northern Chile, though its distribution is more restricted there.</p>
<p>Acca velutina is known for its edible fruits and is sometimes cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acca velutina was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and potential for fruit production.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1970s and has since spread beyond cultivated areas into native ecosystems. The plant's rapid growth and ability to establish itself in various habitats have raised concerns about its impact on local biodiversity. It is now considered a potential invasive species in some regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological effects.</p>
