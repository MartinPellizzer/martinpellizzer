<p>Anabasis caespitosa, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Anabasis caespitosa is well adapted to drought and can survive extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
