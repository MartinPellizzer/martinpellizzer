                    <h1>Ammannia boraei</h1>
<p>Ammannia boraei, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in the harsh, cold conditions of the continent's coastal regions. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that bloom during the brief summer season. It plays a role in the fragile ecosystem of Antarctica by providing habitat and food for local invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered one of the most resilient plants in the world.</p>
