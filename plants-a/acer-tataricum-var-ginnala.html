<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, clustered yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it adaptable to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum var. ginnala has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and reddish-brown, with a somewhat flaky bark that peels in thin strips as the tree matures. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, arranged in panicles, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum var. ginnala is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, specifically China, Korea, and Russia.</p>
<p>It is now widely cultivated in temperate regions around the world, including parts of Europe and North America. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands, stream banks, and mountainous areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, its natural habitat faces pressures from habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum var. ginnala is a hardy ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and compact growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This species has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 10–15 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Regular watering is needed during the first growing season, followed by deep watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum var. ginnala is a hardy deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its berries serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It acts as an effective erosion control plant due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil. Additionally, it can serve as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its allelopathic properties.</p>
<p>Its presence also contributes to improving soil structure and promoting biodiversity in forested and cultivated landscapes.</p>
