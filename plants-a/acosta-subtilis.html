                <h1>Acosta subtilis</h1>
<p>Acosta subtilis, commonly known as the subtle acosta, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, pale green to blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months, often in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acosta subtilis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta subtilis has leaves that are oval in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta subtilis is primarily native to the western regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and mountainous areas where the climate is cool and dry. This plant thrives in regions with well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or sandy substrates. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches, making it a rare and specialized species.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, Acosta subtilis is considered an endemic plant in these particular areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta subtilis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in regions where it can thrive in partial shade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. This plant has been reported in several countries in South America, including Argentina, Chile, and Peru. Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in many ecosystems where it is not native.</p>
