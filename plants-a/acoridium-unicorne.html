<p>Acoridium unicorne, commonly known as the single-horned acoridium, is a rare and enigmatic plant species belonging to the Acoraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, elongated spadix that distinguishes it from other members of its family. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Acoridium unicorne is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
