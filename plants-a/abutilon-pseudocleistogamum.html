                        <h1>Abutilon pseudocleistogamum</h1>
<p>Abutilon pseudocleistogamum, commonly known as the cleistogamous abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its unique reproductive strategy, producing both open and closed (cleistogamous) flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its cleistogamous flowers are self-pollinated, while the open flowers are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental potential and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations.</p>
