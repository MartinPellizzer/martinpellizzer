                        <h1>Abarema lehmannii</h1>
<p>Abarema lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's sensitiveplant, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold when touched. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, which are typically followed by pod-like fruits. Abarema lehmannii is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and shrublands.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant responses to environmental stimuli.</p>
