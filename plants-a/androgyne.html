                    <h1>Androgyne</h1>
<p>Androgyne, commonly known as *Androgyne* (though it is not a recognized scientific name for a specific plant species), refers to a term that can describe plants with both male and female reproductive structures.</p>
<p>In botany, such plants are known as monoecious, meaning they have separate male and female flowers on the same individual. Some plants exhibit androgyne characteristics in their floral morphology, where both stamens and pistils are present in the same flower. These plants often rely on wind or insects for pollination.</p>
<p>The term is sometimes used in horticulture to describe plants that display both masculine and feminine traits in their growth patterns.</p>
