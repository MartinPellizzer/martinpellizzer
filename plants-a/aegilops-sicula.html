<p>Aegilops sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian goatgrass, is a wild annual grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the tribe Aegilopieae within the grass family Poaceae. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“100 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelet-based inflorescences. Its seeds are small and often used in traditional agricultural practices.</p>
<p>Aegilops sicula is valued for its potential in breeding programs due to its genetic diversity and adaptability to various climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
