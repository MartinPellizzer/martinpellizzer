                <h1>Abrus pulchellus var. tenuiflorus</h1>
<p>Abrus pulchellus var. tenuiflorus, commonly known as the slender-flowered velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces striking crimson or orange-red pods that contain toxic seeds. The plant is characterized by its showy, butterfly-shaped flowers and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to the toxicity of its seeds, caution is advised when handling or consuming any part of the plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abrus pulchellus var. tenuiflorus has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a flat, leathery pod that splits open to release seeds with long, silky filaments, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus pulchellus var. tenuiflorus is a rare and unique variant of the spurred gentian, native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the high-altitude areas of this region. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes, typically at altitudes between 2,500 and 3,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this variant is considered endangered, with its population declining steadily over the past few decades.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this rare plant in its natural habitat.</p>
