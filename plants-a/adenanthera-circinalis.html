                <h1>Adenanthera circinalis</h1>
<p>Adenanthera circinalis, commonly known as the African burr or the African acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and produces yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny pods. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species. Its seeds are encased in rough, prickly pods that can persist on the plant for extended periods.</p>
<p>The plant has traditional uses in various cultures for medicinal and practical purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthera circinalis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a pale green to brownish color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and have a pale yellow to greenish color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera circinalis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of northern Australia, particularly in the northern territories like Queensland and the Northern Territory. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its natural range extends to the Philippines and parts of New Guinea.</p>
<p>Adenanthera circinalis is well adapted to the warm, humid climates of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera circinalis was mainly introduced to South Africa as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, including parts of southern Africa, where it grows along roadsides and in disturbed soils. The plant is also found in some areas of Australia, where it has been introduced for similar reasons. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
