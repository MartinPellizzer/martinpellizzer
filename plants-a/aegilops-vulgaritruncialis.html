                <h1>Aegilops vulgaritruncialis</h1>
<p>Aegilops vulgaritruncialis, commonly known as the common wild einkorn, is a wild relative of wheat native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a diploid species with a genome size of approximately 1.7 gigabases. The plant typically grows as a tufted annual grass with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, pale green to brown florets.</p>
<p>The seeds are usually small and enclosed in a lemma and palea, typical of the grass family.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops vulgaritruncialis has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and smooth, with a grayish-brown color, growing in a clump-like pattern. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale blue to purple florets, blooming in early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed spikelet that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry environments by anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>
