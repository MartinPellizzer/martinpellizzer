                <h1>Acinodendron goudotii</h1>
<p>Acinodendron goudotii, commonly known as the African sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed. The tree produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are important for wildlife. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 20 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron goudotii has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to elliptic leaflets that are green on top and slightly lighter underneath, measuring approximately 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron goudotii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, specifically found in countries such as Gabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Cameroon.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid lowland rainforests and is commonly found in secondary growth areas. This plant is often associated with moist, shaded environments and is part of the Rubiaceae family. Its distribution is largely limited to the central and western parts of the African continent.</p>
<p>Acinodendron goudotii is not found outside of its native range in Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron goudotii was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and adaptability.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, where it has established itself in disturbed or secondary forests. The plant's introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive, as it can spread rapidly through seed dispersal by wind and animals. However, its ecological impact remains under study, as it has not yet been classified as a major weed in these regions.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful monitoring is recommended to prevent unintended ecological consequences.</p>
