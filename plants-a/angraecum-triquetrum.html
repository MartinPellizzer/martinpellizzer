                    <h1>Angraecum triquetrum</h1>
<p>Angraecum triquetrum, commonly known as the three-angled angraecum, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, triquetrous (three-angled) seed pods and its ability to produce fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
