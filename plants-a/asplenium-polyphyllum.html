<p>Asplenium polyphyllum, commonly known as the many-leaved spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rosette of fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in temperate climates with high humidity.</p>
<p>Asplenium polyphyllum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and air-purifying qualities.</p>
