<p>Amylotheca cordilimba, commonly known as the slender-stemmed lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive thallus structure with a leathery, greenish to yellowish upper surface and a lighter, more granular lower surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides photosynthetic capability. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and specific habitat requirements make it a valuable indicator of environmental health.</p>
