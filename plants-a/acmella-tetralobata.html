                <h1>Acmella tetralobata</h1>
<p>Acmella tetralobata, commonly known as the four-lobed triggerplant, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky flowers that resemble triggers, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green blooms that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It is typically found in sandy or coastal soils and thrives in well-drained environments.</p>
<p>Acmella tetralobata is primarily grown as an ornamental plant for its unique floral structure and is also used in traditional herbal medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella tetralobata has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they range in size from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that has a slightly rough texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green with four lobes, and they bloom from late spring to early summer, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
