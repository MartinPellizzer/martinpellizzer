<p>Atriplex barclayana subsp.</p>
<p>lurida, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically in the spring. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity.</p>
<p>The species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
