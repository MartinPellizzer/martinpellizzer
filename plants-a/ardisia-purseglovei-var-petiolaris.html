<p>Ardisia purseglovei var. petiolaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ardisia, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
