                    <h1>Agrostis spiciformis</h1>
<p>Agrostis spiciformis, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are followed by spikelets that contain both glumes and lemmas.</p>
<p>Agrostis spiciformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
