                <h1>Achras parvifolia</h1>
<p>Achras parvifolia, commonly known as the African star apple, is a small, slow-growing tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a dense, rounded canopy and produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is notable for its edible, star-shaped fruits that have a sweet, juicy pulp. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Achras parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit in home gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras parvifolia has palmate leaves that are broad, lobed, and dark green, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is unbranched, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a fleshy, red drupe that splits to release seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras parvifolia is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of South America, particularly in Brazil and the Lesser Antilles. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and dry forests. It is commonly associated with sandy soils and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its native range includes regions with warm, humid conditions and low annual rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras parvifolia was mainly introduced to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and near human settlements due to its tolerance for disturbed soils and ability to thrive in sunny conditions. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value, especially for its large, palm-like leaves and unique fruit. It has also been introduced to parts of the Caribbean and southern Florida as a landscape plant.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its preference for warm climates and its sensitivity to frost.</p>
