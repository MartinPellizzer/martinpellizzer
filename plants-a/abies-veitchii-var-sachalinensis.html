                    <h1>Abies veitchii var. sachalinensis</h1>
<p>Abies veitchii var. sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the island of Sakhalin in the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>It is a variant of the Veitch fir, characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces cones that are typically pendulous, with elongated scales and a distinctive, sweet scent. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
