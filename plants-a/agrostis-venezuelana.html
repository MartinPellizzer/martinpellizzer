<p>Agrostis venezuelana, commonly known as the Venezuelan meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Venezuela.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
