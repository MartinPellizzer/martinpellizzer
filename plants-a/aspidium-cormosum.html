                    <h1>Aspidium cormosum</h1>
<p>Aspidium cormosum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent, which aids in attracting pollinators and enhancing its ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
