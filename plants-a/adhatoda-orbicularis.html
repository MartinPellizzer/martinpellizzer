                <h1>Adhatoda orbicularis</h1>
<p>Adhatoda orbicularis, commonly known as the Indian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its orbicular, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks. It has a creeping growth habit with hairy stems and is known for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>The leaves and flowers are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda orbicularis has orbicular-shaped leaves that are broad and rounded, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and slightly hairy, with a light brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are tubular, with five lobes, and are typically pale blue or violet, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda orbicularis is a tropical climbing plant native to the Indian subcontinent, including countries such as India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean, where it has been introduced as an ornamental or medicinal plant. This species thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. It grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adhatoda orbicularis is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, but local populations may face threats due to habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda orbicularis is a tropical plant known for its ornamental leaves and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for consistent growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and occasional pruning to maintain shape are beneficial. It is relatively pest and disease-resistant but may suffer from aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adhatoda orbicularis is a medicinal plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for its reproduction and the health of the ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of nearby crops by improving soil conditions and reducing pest infestations. Additionally, its deep root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Adhatoda orbicularis also contributes to nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants in the vicinity.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adhatoda orbicularis is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications across various domains.</p>
<p>In medicinal applications, it is valued for its properties that help in treating respiratory ailments and digestive issues.
