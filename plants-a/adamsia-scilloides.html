                <h1>Adamsia scilloides</h1>
<p>Adamsia scilloides, commonly known as the pink bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adamsia scilloides has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray color and a linear shape.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a compact, low shrub form. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and a yellow center, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamsia scilloides is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and coastal areas, often found in dry, sunny environments. This plant is commonly associated with limestone and calcareous soils. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, including high temperatures and limited moisture.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the western and southern parts of the Mediterranean Basin.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamsia scilloides was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there intentionally for ornamental purposes due to its attractive blue flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some parts of its introduced range.</p>
