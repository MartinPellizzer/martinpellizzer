                    <h1>Aconitum delphiniifolium</h1>
<p>Aconitum delphiniifolium, commonly known as the Delphinium-leaved Aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed, resembling those of delphinium, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Aconitum delphiniifolium contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>
