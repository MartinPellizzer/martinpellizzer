                    <h1>Aloe boylei</h1>
<p>Aloe boylei, commonly known as the Boyle's aloe, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems that are often tinged with red or purple hues, and its leaves are thick, spiny, and covered in a whitish powdery coating called farina. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Aloe boylei is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its leaves and stems, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular specimen among succulent enthusiasts.</p>
