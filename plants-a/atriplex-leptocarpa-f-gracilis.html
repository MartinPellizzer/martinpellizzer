                    <h1>Atriplex leptocarpa f. gracilis</h1>
<p>Atriplex leptocarpa f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-secreting glands, a feature typical of the Chenopodiaceae family. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its flowering stems produce small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate extreme conditions.</p>
