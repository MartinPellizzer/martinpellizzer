                <h1>Achyranthes styracifolia</h1>
<p>Achyranthes styracifolia, commonly known as Indian knotweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that contains several small, smooth seeds.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and disturbed areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes styracifolia has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are typically 5-10 cm long and 1-2 cm wide, displaying a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the summer months and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a three-valved capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes styracifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often seen in forests, undergrowth, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the climatic conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes styracifolia was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-altered landscapes, such as roadsides, waste areas, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate and subtropical climates, making it a common weed in regions with warm, humid conditions. The plant is often found in the wild in parts of Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds contribute to its success in invaded habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
