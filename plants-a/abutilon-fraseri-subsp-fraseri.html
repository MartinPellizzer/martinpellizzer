Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their primitive structures and spore reproduction.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that typically have separate male and female reproductive organs and are often characterized by showy flowers. Its order is Malvales, which includes plants with five-petaled flowers and often has specialized structures like hirsute leaves and stipules. Its family is Malvaceae, commonly known as the mallow family, which includes plants such as cotton and hibiscus, characterized by their showy flowers and capsule fruits. Its genus is Abutilon, a group of flowering plants commonly known as the "velvetleaf" or "Chinese lantern" plants, known for their fuzzy leaves and showy flowers.</p>
