<p>The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon fraseri subsp.</p>
<p>fraseri has palmate leaves that are usually 5-7 lobed, with a green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem. The stems are cylindrical, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a pale green to brownish bark that becomes rougher with age.</p>
<p>The flowers are showy, with five petals and a yellowish or greenish calyx, typically blooming in spring and summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon fraseri subsp.</p>
<p>fraseri is a species native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Jamaica and parts of the Greater Antilles. Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range, with limited introductions in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in coastal and lowland areas, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. This plant typically grows at altitudes between 0 and 300 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
