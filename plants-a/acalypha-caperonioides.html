<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many species with distinctive floral structures and often show a wide range of growth forms. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse habits and some containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupweed," characterized by their showy bracts and often used in ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha caperonioides, a specific type within the genus Acalypha, known for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
