                <h1>Acosta peucedanifolia</h1>
<p>Acosta peucedanifolia, commonly known as the Andean angel's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, black, oily seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling as it contains toxic compounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta peucedanifolia has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta peucedanifolia is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude environments, including mountainous areas and dry valleys. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is an important species in local ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and supporting various wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta peucedanifolia was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with moderate rainfall and sufficient sunlight. This plant has been introduced to several parts of Europe and North America as an ornamental species. Its introduction has led to its cultivation in gardens and parks due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts.</p>
