                <h1>Adenostyles canescens</h1>
<p>Adenostyles canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf phlox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine,茸毛-like hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to shallow soils, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Adenostyles canescens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles canescens has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a grayish-green color and a hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is gray to brown in color, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
