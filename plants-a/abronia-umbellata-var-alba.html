                    <h1>Abronia umbellata var. alba</h1>
<p>Abronia umbellata var. alba, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers. The plant produces small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize sandy and disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in xeriscaping.</p>
