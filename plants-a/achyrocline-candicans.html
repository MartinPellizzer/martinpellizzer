                <h1>Achyrocline candicans</h1>
<p>Achyrocline candicans, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, characterized by its succulent, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring and summer months. It is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native habitat and is considered an endemic species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also classified as a vulnerable species in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline candicans has compound, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a rough, hairy texture, typically ranging in color from green to reddish-brown. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white to pale blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when mature, and the seeds are tiny, dry, and wind-dispersed.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline candicans is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America, such as Mexico and Guatemala. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and is often associated with sandy soils. It is commonly found in dry, sunny habitats along the shoreline.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to some regions of South America, including Brazil and Argentina.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline candicans was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy, colorful flowers. The plant has been found in various regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Australia. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native flora remains under study.</p>
