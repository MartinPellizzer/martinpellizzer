                <h1>Adenia bequaertii</h1>
<p>Adenia bequaertii, commonly known as the African mountain cucumber, is a climbing shrub native to eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its thick, woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive crown of bracts, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and traditional uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia bequaertii has elliptical, glossy leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, aiding in water absorption from the surrounding soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia bequaertii is primarily native to Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, DR Congo, Gabon, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in dense forests and moist habitats. Adenia bequaertii is part of the Passifloraceae family.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the central and western parts of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia bequaertii was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with high levels of sunlight and moderate to high rainfall. This plant is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections due to its ornamental value. It is considered an exotic species in many parts of the world where it is not native.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been mainly for horticultural purposes rather than for agricultural or ecological reasons.</p>
