<p>Artemisia arctica subsp.</p>
<p>ehrendorferi, commonly known as the Arctic wormwood, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its aromatic properties.</p>
