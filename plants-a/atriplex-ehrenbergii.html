<p>Atriplex ehrenbergii, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high sodium content.</p>
<p>Atriplex ehrenbergii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion.</p>
