                    <h1>Androsace villosa var. congesta</h1>
<p>Androsace villosa var. congesta, commonly known as the woolly mouse-eared cowslip, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often appearing in spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its alpine environment. Its flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies, contributing to its ecological role in mountain ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more compact inflorescence and increased floral density compared to the typical form of Androsace villosa.</p>
