                            <h1>Atractylodes Cuneata</h1>
<p>Atractylodes cuneata is a lesser-known but significant member of the Asteraceae family. Native to parts of East Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and yellowish flowers make it easily identifiable in the wild. Historically, it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Despite its potential, it remains under-researched and often overlooked in modern botanical studies.</p>
