<p>Atriplex vesicaria subsp.</p>
<p>sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, round, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal and inland salt lakes.</p>
<p>Its succulent nature makes it an important component of stabilizing sandy and saline soils in its native habitat.</p>
