                <h1>Acronema pilosum</h1>
<p>Acronema pilosum, commonly known as the hairy acronema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature in the carrot family.</p>
<p>Acronema pilosum is often found in temperate regions of Asia and is valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronema pilosum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in axillary inflorescences, bloom during the spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema pilosum is primarily native to Myanmar.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. It is an important component of the local flora in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to specific habitats within Myanmar.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema pilosum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in temperate climates, particularly in regions of East Asia. Its introduction has been documented in several parts of the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to different soil conditions.</p>
