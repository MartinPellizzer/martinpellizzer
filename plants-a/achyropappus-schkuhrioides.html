                    <h1>Achyropappus schkuhrioides</h1>
<p>Achyropappus schkuhrioides, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows as a low, mat-forming shrub with hairy, silver-gray foliage adapted to withstand drought. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the spring, and the plant produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Sandmat is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to desert environments due to its drought tolerance and shallow root system.</p>
