<p>Anemia mandiocana, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It possesses a unique root system with pneumatophores that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soil. The plant's leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds.</p>
