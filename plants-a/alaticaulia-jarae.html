                    <h1>Alaticaulia jarae</h1>
<p>Alaticaulia jarae, commonly known as the Jarae alatecaul, is a rare shrub native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Alaticaulia jarae plays a crucial role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
