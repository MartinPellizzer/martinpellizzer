                    <h1>Atriplex lacera</h1>
<p>Atriplex lacera, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its deep root system allows it to access moisture from deeper soil layers, enhancing its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Atriplex lacera is often found in disturbed soils and is used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
