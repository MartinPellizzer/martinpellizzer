<p>Aponogeton abyssinicus var. glandulifera, commonly known as the Abyssinian arrowhead, is a rare aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters with sandy or gravelly substrates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters at the water's surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
