                    <h1>Agropyron cristatum var. villosum</h1>
<p>Agropyron cristatum var. villosum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soil in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with silky, hairy bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage crop in dryland agriculture.</p>
