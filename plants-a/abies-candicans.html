                        <h1>Abies candicans</h1>
<p>Abies candicans, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dense, dark green foliage that turns a silvery white underneath. The tree produces cone-like structures called strobiles, which contain the seeds surrounded by a papery bract. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, with shallow fissures, and it can grow to heights of up to 30 meters.</p>
<p>Abies candicans is often found in moist, well-drained soils at high elevations, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies candicans is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high elevation areas, such as the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges. This species thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with mixed coniferous forests and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, its distribution is relatively limited and restricted to certain elevational ranges.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies candicans was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate zones with moderate rainfall and is commonly planted in ornamental landscapes. This species is often used in horticulture for its attractive foliage and conical shape. However, it may become invasive in some regions if not properly managed.</p>
<p>Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native plant species in the wild.</p>
