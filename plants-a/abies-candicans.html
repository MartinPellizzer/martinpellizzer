<p>Abies candicans, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dense, dark green foliage that turns a silvery white underneath.

Its bark is typically smooth and gray, with shallow fissures, and it can grow to heights of up to 30 meters.</p>
<p>Abies candicans is often found in moist, well-drained soils at high elevations, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems.</p>
