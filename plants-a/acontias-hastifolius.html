                    <h1>Acontias hastifolius</h1>
<p>Acontias hastifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, yellowish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in racemes. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants.</p>
