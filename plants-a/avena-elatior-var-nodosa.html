                    <h1>Avena elatior var. nodosa</h1>
<p>Avena elatior var. nodosa, commonly known as the nodding oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of nodding, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are encased in a hard, bristly hull, which aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils along streambanks and in woodland edges.</p>
