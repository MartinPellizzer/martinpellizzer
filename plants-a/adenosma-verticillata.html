                <h1>Adenosma verticillata</h1>
<p>Adenosma verticillata, commonly known as the clustered adenosma, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 centimeters. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale yellow. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma verticillata has leaves that are opposite in arrangement, ovate in shape, and have a serrated margin, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, slightly hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with five pink to purple petals, blooming in spring and summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma verticillata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, forest edges, and disturbed sites. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to parts of India and the Philippines as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma verticillata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban environments. The plant spreads easily due to its prolific seed production and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, it is currently considered a minor weed with limited ecological impact in most areas.</p>
