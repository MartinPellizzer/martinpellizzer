                    <h1>Aegilops triuncialis var. leptostachya</h1>
<p>Aegilops triuncialis var. leptostachya, commonly known as slender-stemmed wild wheat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to modern wheat varieties.</p>
