                    <h1>Arenaria serpyllifolia var. glutinosa</h1>
<p>Arenaria serpyllifolia var. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are coated with a sticky, waxy substance, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
