                <h1>Acinodendron flavescens</h1>
<p>Acinodendron flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered acinodendron, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a smooth texture, while the stems are woody and branching.</p>
<p>Acinodendron flavescens is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, where it thrives in the understory vegetation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron flavescens has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elliptical leaflets that are medium in size, dark green on top, and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that exudes a mild scent when broken. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to nutrient-poor soils and drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron flavescens is primarily native to tropical Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and the Congo.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist lowland forests and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary growth areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within the continent, reflecting its ecological preferences.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron flavescens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activities such as agriculture and land clearing.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in full sun conditions. This plant has shown invasive tendencies in some regions, outcompeting native species for resources. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a potential weed in agricultural fields and natural ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its introduction history, it is now considered an alien species in several parts of the world.</p>
