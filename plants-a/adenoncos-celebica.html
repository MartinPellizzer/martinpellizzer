                <h1>Adenoncos celebica</h1>
<p>Adenoncos celebica, commonly known as the Celebes adenophyton, is a flowering plant native to the Indonesian archipelago.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoncos celebica has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and measure approximately 10-15 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoncos celebica is a species of flowering plant native to the Indonesian archipelago, particularly found in parts of Sulawesi and other nearby islands.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific regions within Indonesia, where it thrives in humid tropical environments. This plant typically grows in lowland and hill forest areas, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full shade. It is generally found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, Adenoncos celebica is considered to be of conservation concern, with its population likely declining.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenoncos celebica is a unique and rare plant native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and slow growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Adenoncos celebica is relatively slow, with new growth appearing seasonally depending on the climate.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization should be done sparingly with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season, while pruning is minimal but helpful for shaping. It is relatively pest and disease resistant, though occasional infestations of scale insects may occur.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like basil or marigold can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenoncos celebica is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the pollination of other plants in the ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through mutualistic relationships. Additionally, its dense root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Adenoncos celebica also plays a role in maintaining biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>
