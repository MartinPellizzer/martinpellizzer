<p>It is characterized by its striking silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Acalypha boehmerioides is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha boehmerioides has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a waxy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that is slightly fibrous, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with stamens that are prominent and showy, blooming from late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha boehmerioides is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including the Caribbean and parts of the United States, often as an ornamental plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. This species typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although its invasive potential in non-native regions raises ecological concerns.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
