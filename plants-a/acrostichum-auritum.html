                <h1>Acrostichum auritum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum auritum, commonly known as the ear-shaped fern, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands and marshes of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive ear-shaped lobes at the base, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistently moist soil.</p>
<p>This fern is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking appearance and air-purifying qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum auritum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a serrated edge and a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green bark that becomes rough with age. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum auritum is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as lowland forests and swampy areas. This fern typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and threats from deforestation, Acrostichum auritum is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acrostichum auritum is a hardy, tropical plant known for its lush, fern-like foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through spores or by dividing the rhizomes, making it relatively easy to cultivate. The growth cycle of Acrostichum auritum is slow but steady, with new fronds emerging throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while keeping an eye out for pests like scale insects and diseases such as root rot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or garlic can help deter pests and promote a healthier garden environment.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
