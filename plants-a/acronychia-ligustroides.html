                <h1>Acronychia ligustroides</h1>
<p>Acronychia ligustroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing elliptical seeds. It thrives in dry to moist soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of northern Queensland and northern Western Australia.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia ligustroides has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, light grey bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows as an erect shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and arranged in clusters, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, smooth, yellow drupe that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia ligustroides is primarily native to the eastern and northern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical rainforests of Queensland, New South Wales, and the Northern Territory. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within these regions. It is commonly associated with creeklines and mountain rainforests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these areas, reflecting its preference for humid and nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia ligustroides was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in disturbed or open habitats. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists in New Zealand.</p>
