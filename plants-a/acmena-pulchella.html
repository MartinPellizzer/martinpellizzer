                <h1>Acmena pulchella</h1>
<p>Acmena pulchella, commonly known as the pretty acmena, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena pulchella has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5-10 cm in length and have a smooth texture. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom in spring; they are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, smooth, round drupe that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena pulchella is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rainforests, coastal regions, and wet sclerophyll forests. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained to moist soils. It is often associated with riverine and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Acmena pulchella is an ornamental plant appreciated for its attractive foliage and small white flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena pulchella was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats, including disturbed sites and along stream margins. The plant is considered a potential invasive species because of its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands. Its introduction has raised concerns among land managers due to its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
