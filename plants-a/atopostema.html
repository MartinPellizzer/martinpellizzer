                    <h1>Atopostema</h1>
<p>Atopostema, commonly known as the "false dandelion," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and the production of small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to various regions in the Americas. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are followed by small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Atopostema species are often mistaken for true dandelions due to their similar appearance.</p>
