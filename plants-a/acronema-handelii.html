                <h1>Acronema handelii</h1>
<p>Acronema handelii, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant features velvety, dark green leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of violet, pink, and white. It is widely cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its beauty and ease of care.</p>
<p>Acronema handelii thrives in humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronema handelii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale greenish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, clustered in racemes, and bloom in late spring to early summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema handelii is primarily native to Assam, China South-Central, East Himalaya, and Myanmar.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, where it thrives in temperate and subtropical climates. It is commonly associated with moist, shaded environments in forests and shrublands. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the unique ecological conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema handelii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, which allows it to spread rapidly.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
