                <h1>Acalypha grandispicata</h1>
<p>Acalypha grandispicata, commonly known as the giant flame flower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Acalypha grandispicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha grandispicata has ovate to elliptic leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. It produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with stamen longer than petals, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged schizocarp that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and smooth.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha grandispicata is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is now also distributed in parts of tropical Africa and the Pacific Islands due to human introduction. This species thrives in humid, tropical environments, often in lowland areas near rivers or in dense rainforests. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Acalypha grandispicata is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although its habitat is threatened by deforestation and land conversion.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha grandispicata is a decorative shrub known for its vibrant foliage and unique floral structures, commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or citronella can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic appeal.</p>
