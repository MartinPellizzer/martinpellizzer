                    <h1>Agrostis canina var. scotica</h1>
<p>Agrostis canina var. scotica, commonly known as Scottish bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on acidic soils. This variety is particularly adapted to coastal and upland environments, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor conditions. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and establish itself in disturbed or marginal habitats.</p>
<p>The plant plays a significant role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity in its native range.</p>
