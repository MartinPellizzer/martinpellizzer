<p>Atriplex patula subsp.</p>
<p>obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, succulent leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are often subtended by specialized leaf-like structures called bracts. It is a halophyte, meaning it can tolerate high levels of soil salinity, making it well-suited for saline soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils in degraded landscapes.</p>
