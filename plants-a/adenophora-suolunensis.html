                <h1>Adenophora suolunensis</h1>
<p>Adenophora suolunensis, commonly known as the Chinese bellflower, is a perennial herb native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy and branching.</p>
<p>Adenophora suolunensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora suolunensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a moderate size ranging from 3 to 7 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and cylindrical, with a light green to brownish color, exhibiting a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are bell-shaped, with five lobes, typically pink to purple in color, blooming in summer (July to August), and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and anchor itself in moist, temperate environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora suolunensis is primarily native to northern China, specifically the regions of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, temperate grasslands and forest edges. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with mountainous areas. It is an important species in traditional Chinese medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora suolunensis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. This plant is commonly found in regions of East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It has been introduced to other parts of the world as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers.</p>
<p>However, its introduction outside its native range may pose ecological risks if it becomes invasive.</p>
