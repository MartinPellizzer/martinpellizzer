                <h1>Acrostichum distans</h1>
<p>Acrostichum distans, commonly known as the common brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a distinctive, rugged texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum distans has large, feather-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can grow up to 3 meters in length, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that has a fibrous texture, and it grows in a creeping manner along the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, blooming during the summer months and relying on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum distans is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of rivers and lakes where there is abundant moisture. This plant thrives in humid, lowland environments and is often associated with disturbed or flooded soils. It is also present in some Caribbean islands, where it grows in similar wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific moisture conditions, its distribution is largely limited to these tropical and subtropical areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum distans was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. This plant has been reported in several states including Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>However, it is currently considered a minor invasive species in these areas.</p>
