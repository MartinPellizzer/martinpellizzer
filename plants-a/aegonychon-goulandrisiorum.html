                <h1>Aegonychon goulandrisiorum</h1>
<p>Aegonychon goulandrisiorum, commonly known as the Goulandris orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant blooms that typically feature a mix of white and purple hues. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegonychon goulandrisiorum has leaves that are elongated, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, greyish-brown bark, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>
