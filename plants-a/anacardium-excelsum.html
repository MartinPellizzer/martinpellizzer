<p>Anacardium excelsum, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces distinctive, woody fruits that encase its edible seeds. The tree's bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against pests and environmental stress. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
