                    <h1>Arbutus mucronata</h1>
<p>Arbutus mucronata, commonly known as the strawberry tree, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western coast of the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Its bark is rugged and scaly, often peeling away to reveal a reddish-brown underneath, and it is well adapted to coastal environments with mild, wet winters.</p>
