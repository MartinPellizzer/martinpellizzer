<p>Atriplex barclayana subsp.</p>
<p>palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves contain high levels of salts and oxalates, which help it survive in saline soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
