                    <h1>Acraea widgrenii</h1>
<p>Acraea widgrenii, commonly known as the Widgren's acraea, is a species of butterfly found in various parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nymphalidae and is characterized by its striking wing patterns. The plant it interacts with, primarily milkweed species, plays a crucial role in its life cycle as a host plant for its larvae. The butterfly's larvae feed on the leaves of these plants, which are rich in nutrients.</p>
<p>The relationship between Acraea widgrenii and its host plants is an important example of ecological interdependence in African ecosystems.</p>
