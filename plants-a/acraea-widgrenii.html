                <h1>Acraea widgrenii</h1>
<p>Acraea widgrenii, commonly known as the Widgren's acraea, is a species of butterfly found in various parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nymphalidae and is characterized by its striking wing patterns. The plant it interacts with, primarily milkweed species, plays a crucial role in its life cycle as a host plant for its larvae. The butterfly's larvae feed on the leaves of these plants, which are rich in nutrients.</p>
<p>The relationship between Acraea widgrenii and its host plants is an important example of ecological interdependence in African ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acraea widgrenii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light greenish-brown color, exhibiting a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a yellowish color and a structure that includes five petals, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid environment by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acraea widgrenii is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas and near water sources in these regions. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with the presence of its host plants, which are typically members of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these African countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acraea widgrenii was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it can thrive in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed areas, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with warm temperatures and moderate to high humidity. The plant prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with areas that have a mix of sunlight and shade. Its introduction has been observed in several parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by the need for specific host plants and environmental conditions.</p>
