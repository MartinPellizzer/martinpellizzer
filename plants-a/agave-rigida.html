                    <h1>Agave rigida</h1>
<p>Agave rigida, commonly known as the rigid agave, is a perennial succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, blue-green, spiky leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The rigid agave is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
