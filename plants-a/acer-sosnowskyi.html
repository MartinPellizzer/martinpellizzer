<p>Acer sosnowskyi, commonly known as the Sosnowsky's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
