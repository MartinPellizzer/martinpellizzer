                <h1>Acrostichum aculeatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum aculeatum, commonly known as the rough hedyotis, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, clustered, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum aculeatum has large, feather-like leaves that are elongated, narrow, and arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a clump-forming pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and anchor itself in wetland habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum aculeatum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often associated with disturbed or flooded areas. Its native range extends from southern Mexico through the Caribbean islands to northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It is also present in some regions of Southeast Asia, though its primary distribution remains in the Americas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum aculeatum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as landscaping and horticultural practices.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and wetlands, often outcompeting native vegetation. This plant has spread across various regions, including parts of the southeastern United States and the Caribbean. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist conditions contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it poses a threat to local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
