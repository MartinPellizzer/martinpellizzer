The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a ground cover in landscaping.</p>
