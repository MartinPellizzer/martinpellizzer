<p>Arenaria grandiflora subsp.</p>
<p>incrassata, commonly known as the thick-leaved sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant features dense, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in early summer.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
