                <h1>Acer tegmentosum subsp. rufinerve</h1>
<p>Acer tegmentosum subsp.</p>
<p>rufinerve, commonly known as the red-veined maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive red or reddish-brown veins on the leaves, which stand out against the green or yellowish leaf blades.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and has a spreading, rounded crown. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves unfold in spring.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum subsp.</p>
<p>rufinerve has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green or sometimes reddish underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a paired samara, each with a thin wing, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its natural habitat in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum subsp.</p>
<p>rufinerve is a rare and lesser-known maple species native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, specifically in the provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi. Its current distribution is limited and fragmented, with populations found primarily in remote areas of these regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments within temperate forests, often growing along stream banks and in rocky crevices. This subspecies typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation and habitat degradation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum subsp.</p>
<p>rufinerve is a deciduous tree known for its striking red stems and maple-like leaves, commonly cultivated in temperate climates. It can be propagated through seed sowing or softwood cuttings, with cuttings often yielding faster results.</p>
<p>The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum subsp.</p>
<p>rufinerve is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecosystem pollination.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum subsp.</p>
<p>rufinerve is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use but valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It has been used in some indigenous cultures for treating skin conditions and respiratory ailments.</p>
<p>While not widely utilized in industrial applications, its wood may have niche uses in crafts or small-scale woodworking. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications remain more traditional and regional rather than widespread.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum subsp.</p>
<p>rufinerve has several popular cultivars such as 'Orangeola' and 'Redmond,' which are prized for their vibrant autumn foliage. The species is also commonly used in hybridization to create new varieties with enhanced ornamental traits.</p>
<p>Hybrids involving this subspecies often exhibit improved growth habits and coloration, making them valuable in horticulture. Its horticultural importance lies in its adaptability to various garden conditions and its aesthetic appeal during the fall season.</p>
<p>These characteristics have made it a sought-after plant for landscapers and garden enthusiasts alike.</p>
