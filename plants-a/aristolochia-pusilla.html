                    <h1>Aristolochia pusilla</h1>
<p>Aristolochia pusilla, commonly known as the small Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine that produces distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers with a deep purple to brown coloration. The plant's leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its flowers emit a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract its primary pollinator, the carrion beetle. Aristolochia pusilla contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it a plant of both botanical interest and caution.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
