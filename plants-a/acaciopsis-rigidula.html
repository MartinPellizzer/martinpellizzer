<p>Acaciopsis rigidula, commonly known as the rigid acaciopsis, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, oblong leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are typically straight and can grow up to several meters in height.</p>
<p>Acaciopsis rigidula is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in semi-desert ecosystems.</p>
