<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus genevei is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. This plant is well adapted to dry climates and can survive with minimal water. It is commonly found in open grasslands and savanna environments.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific regions in southern Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus genevei was mainly introduced to new agricultural regions for its potential as a vegetable crop.</p>
<p>It is known for its edible pods, which are similar to okra but have a milder flavor. The plant has been cultivated in parts of Asia and Africa due to its adaptability to various soil types.
