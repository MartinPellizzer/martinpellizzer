<p>Adenanthos sericeus subsp.</p>
<p>sphalmus, commonly known as the silky adenanthos, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, silver-blue leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in heathlands and open woodlands, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
