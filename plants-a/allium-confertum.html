                    <h1>Allium confertum</h1>
<p>Allium confertum, commonly known as the clustered garlic, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features a dense cluster of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-like, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its bulbs are similar to garlic but are less commonly used in culinary applications.</p>
<p>Allium confertum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soil.</p>
