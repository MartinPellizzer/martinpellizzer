                        <h1>Abies heterophylla</h1>
<p>Abies heterophylla, commonly known as the variable fir, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinct foliage, which changes in appearance with age, featuring needle-like leaves on the lower branches and broader, flatter leaves higher up. The tree typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as mountainous regions, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its cones are small and reddish-brown, maturing within a single growing season.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies heterophylla is primarily native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as California, Nevada, and Arizona, as well as in northern Baja California. This species typically grows in high-elevation areas, often in coniferous forests. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Abies heterophylla is commonly associated with mountainous terrain and is an important component of subalpine ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies heterophylla was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool climates, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of British Columbia. The plant thrives in USDA hardiness zones 4 through 7, where it can grow as a shade-tolerant evergreen. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and dense foliage.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native environments.</p>
