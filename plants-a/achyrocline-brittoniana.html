                <h1>Achyrocline brittoniana</h1>
<p>Achyrocline brittoniana, commonly known as the Britton's achyrocline, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Jamaica and Cuba.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough texture, and the flowers are small, yellowish, and arranged in a compact cluster.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline brittoniana has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branched structure. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white to pale purple petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline brittoniana is primarily native to the Caribbean region, particularly the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical climates. It is often associated with coastal areas and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline brittoniana was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. The plant has since spread to other parts of the Pacific Islands. It is considered an invasive species in some areas because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
