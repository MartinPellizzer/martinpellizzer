                <h1>Aechmea viridispica</h1>
<p>Aechmea viridispica, commonly known as the green-spiked aecharmea, is a bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its epiphytic growth. The plant produces striking, spiky inflorescences that range in color from green to red, depending on the variety. Its leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aechmea viridispica thrives in humid environments with indirect light and is popular as a decorative houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea viridispica has broad, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, fibrous root system that anchors it to its substrate. It produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences with small white to green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, particularly beetles and flies.</p>
<p>The fruit is a fleshy capsule that contains numerous black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
