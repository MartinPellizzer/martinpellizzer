<p>Aristolochia biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hood-shaped flowers that resemble a pipe, with a deep purple to brown coloration. The plant produces two small, greenish-yellow flowers at the base of each leaf, which are often hidden among the foliage. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and twining.</p>
<p>The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to severe health issues, making it important to avoid ingestion.</p>
