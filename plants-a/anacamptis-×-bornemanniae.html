<p>Anacamptis × bornemanniae, commonly known as the hybrid lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Anacamptis morio and Anacamptis pyramidalis, characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in a spiral pattern, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but remains relatively rare in the wild.</p>
