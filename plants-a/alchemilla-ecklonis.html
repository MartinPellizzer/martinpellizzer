<p>Alchemilla ecklonis, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Alchemilla ecklonis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in gardens for its drought tolerance and aesthetic qualities.</p>
