                <h1>Acer luteolum</h1>
<p>Acer luteolum, commonly known as the yellow maplesapling, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its small size, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The tree produces delicate, yellowish-green leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall, adding visual interest to the landscape. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and light gray, with a tendency to flake off in small pieces as the tree matures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer luteolum has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a bright yellow-green color during the growing season and turning red in autumn; they are arranged alternately along the stem and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with an upright habit. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer luteolum is a small, deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas, primarily found in countries such as India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>While it was historically distributed across a broader area, its current range is more restricted, with populations mainly concentrated in the lower elevations of these regions. It thrives in moist, temperate environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Acer luteolum is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer luteolum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant yellow foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and promote air circulation are recommended.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with flowering shrubs and perennials for aesthetic complement.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer luteolum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in landscaping, enhancing the aesthetic and ecological value of the garden. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of insects and animals in its habitat.</p>
