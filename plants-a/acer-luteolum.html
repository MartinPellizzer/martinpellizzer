                <h1>Acer luteolum</h1>
<p>Acer luteolum, commonly known as the yellow maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow leaves, which turn orange-red in the fall. The plant has a slender, upright growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. Its leaves are typically ovate with serrated edges and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>Acer luteolum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer luteolum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright green during the growing season and turn yellow in the fall. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer luteolum is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate forest environments, typically at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The species is considered endangered due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer luteolum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant yellow foliage, commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer luteolum is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its yellow flowers. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its dense roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil quality and supporting local fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer luteolum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>In medicinal applications, it has been explored for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, though scientific research is limited. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and ecological balance, supporting local wildlife and soil health. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in certain regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications are more ecological and symbolic than practical in modern contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer luteolum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Atropurpureum' and 'Variegatum', which are known for their striking foliage colors. Hybrids of Acer luteolum are often created to enhance traits such as hardiness and leaf coloration. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in a range of conditions.</p>
<p>Their unique appearance makes them a desirable addition to gardens and landscapes.</p>
