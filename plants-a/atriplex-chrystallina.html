<p>Atriplex chrystallina, commonly known as the silver leaf chenopod, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces greenish-white flowers in clusters. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, saline conditions.</p>
<p>Atriplex chrystallina plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
