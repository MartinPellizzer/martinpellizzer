<p>Acer campestre schwerinii, commonly known as the Sauerheim maple, is a cultivar of the common maple tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. It typically grows to a moderate height and prefers well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes, making it a popular choice for urban and residential plantings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre schwerinii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes furrowed with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub with a rounded crown. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in cymes, appearing in late spring with a pale yellowish-green color, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre schwerinii is a rare and critically endangered variant of the field maple, native to a very limited area in Germany.</p>
<p>Its native range is restricted to the region around the city of Schwerin in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Currently, it is found only in a few fragmented populations within its original habitat, primarily in moist, calcareous soils. It typically grows in lowland areas at altitudes below 300 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its extremely limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre schwerinii is a compact, slow-growing maple known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings offering the most reliable results. This plant has a temperate growth cycle, thriving in spring and summer with a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging to prevent root rot. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal in garden landscapes.</p>
