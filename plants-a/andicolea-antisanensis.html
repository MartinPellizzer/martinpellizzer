                <h1>Andicolea antisanensis</h1>
<p>Andicolea antisanensis, commonly known as the Antisanensis fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, showcasing its adaptability to nutrient-poor soils. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Andicolea antisanensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
