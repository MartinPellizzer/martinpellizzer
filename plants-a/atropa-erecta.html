<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dark green, broad leaves and bell-shaped, violet or purple flowers. The plant produces berries that are initially green and turn red or black when mature, which are highly poisonous due to the presence of tropane alkaloids.

<p>The plant is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which also includes other toxic and economically important species.</p>
