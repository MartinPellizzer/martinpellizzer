                    <h1>Alnus incana</h1>
<p>Alnus incana, commonly known as the gray alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish bark and small, simple leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are wind-pollinated, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Alnus incana is often found in riparian zones and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria.</p>
<p>This makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
