                    <h1>Alyxia microbuxus</h1>
<p>Alyxia microbuxus, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as oaks and hickories, in the southeastern United States. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Alyxia microbuxus plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
