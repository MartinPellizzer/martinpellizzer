                        <h1>Acacia selloi</h1>
<p>Acacia selloi, commonly known as the Sello's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, feather-like leaves that reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Acacia selloi is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia selloi is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, savanna-like environments and is commonly found in woodland areas with well-drained soils. This species is often associated with rocky or limestone outcrops, where it forms part of the local vegetation. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acacia selloi is also known for its ability to withstand drought conditions, making it well-adapted to its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia selloi was mainly introduced to areas with a warm, dry climate and well-drained soils, typically found in regions such as parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid landscapes. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber or fuelwood in these regions. Its introduction has been primarily for ecological restoration and agricultural purposes.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly.</p>
