                        <h1>Acacia selloi</h1>
<p>Acacia selloi, commonly known as the Sello's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, feather-like leaves that reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Acacia selloi is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.</p>
