                    <h1>Ajuga saxicola</h1>
<p>Ajuga saxicola, commonly known as the stonecrop ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in early to mid-summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it suitable for rock gardens and shady borders.</p>
<p>Ajuga saxicola is well adapted to poor, well-drained soils and can tolerate partial to full shade.</p>
