<p>Aragallus ventosus, commonly known as the windgrass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Aragallus ventosus is adapted to high-altitude conditions and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
