                <h1>Achillea × dobrogensis</h1>
<p>Achillea × dobrogensis, commonly known as the Dobrogian aster, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the Carpathian region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and showy, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it may exhibit a range of morphological variations in different populations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × dobrogensis has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a gray-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, slightly branched, and have a rough, grayish-brown bark. The flowers are composite, consisting of ray florets and disk florets, with a pale yellow to white color, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × dobrogensis is a hybrid plant native to the Balkan Peninsula, specifically found in parts of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes cultivated areas and naturalized sites in Europe, particularly in temperate regions with mild climates. It thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin and limited natural range, it is considered a rare plant with a conservation status that is currently listed as least concern, though habitat loss poses a potential threat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × dobrogensis is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rootstock or by sowing seeds in early spring. The growth cycle of this plant involves a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its health and appearance.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with other drought-tolerant plants in companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea × dobrogensis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering both sustenance and shelter. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. Additionally, its dense root system helps with erosion control, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>It also contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea × dobrogensis is a hybrid plant known for its ornamental value and use in gardens, where it contributes to landscape aesthetics.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may have potential in herbal medicine for its possible anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it is not significant, but its cultivation can support local biodiversity and ecological balance. Culturally, it may hold symbolic meanings in certain regions, though specific traditions are not well documented.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary role remains in horticulture and ecological contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea × dobrogensis has a limited number of recognized cultivars, with 'Aurea' being one of the most popular for its bright yellow foliage and compact growth.</p>
<p>While natural hybrids between Achillea millefolium and Achillea nobilis are rare, some horticulturists have developed cultivars through selective breeding to enhance ornamental traits. These plants are valued for their hardiness and ability to thrive in various garden conditions, making them a useful addition to rock gardens and borders. Their horticultural importance lies in their adaptability and long-lasting flowers, which provide color throughout the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to their unique appearance and resilience, they are increasingly favored in modern landscape design.</p>
