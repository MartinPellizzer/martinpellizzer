                        <h1>Abama pubens</h1>
<p>Abama pubens, commonly known as the hairy abama, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central stamen.</p>
<p>Abama pubens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abama pubens is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments and is often associated with swampy or saturated soils. It is an important component of the wetland ecosystems in its native range.</p>
<p>Abama pubens is also occasionally found in the Caribbean islands, though it is more widespread in the Florida peninsula.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abama pubens was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fuzzy foliage. The plant has since spread along disturbed areas and roadsides, becoming a common sight in these habitats. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to outcompete native species in certain environments.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major invasive species in most areas where it is found.</p>
