<p>Aloe grisea, commonly known as the gray aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a grayish-blue waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves contain a gel that is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Aloe grisea is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
