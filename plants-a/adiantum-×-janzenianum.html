                    <h1>Adiantum × janzenianum</h1>
<p>Adiantum × janzenianum, commonly known as the Janzen's maidenhair fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Adiantum capillus-veneris and Adiantum capillus-veneris var. capillus-veneris.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, sporangia-bearing sori on the underside of its leaves, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Adiantum × janzenianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
