                    <h1>Ananas comosus var. erectifolius</h1>
<p>Ananas comosus var. erectifolius, commonly known as the upright leaf pineapple, is a rare variant of the pineapple plant characterized by its erect, sword-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America and is known for its unique growth habit compared to the standard pineapple. The plant produces a spiky crown of leaves at the top, which can develop into a pineapple fruit under the right conditions. It is less commonly cultivated than the standard variety due to its slower growth and lower fruit yield.</p>
<p>Botanically, it exhibits traits that make it a subject of interest in plant genetics and horticultural research.</p>
