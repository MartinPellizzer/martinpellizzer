                    <h1>Aphylleia</h1>
<p>Aphylleia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gentianaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of true leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its stems and floral bracts. The plants are typically small, herbaceous annuals or perennials, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Aphylleia species produce strikingly simple, usually blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to their unique morphology and limited distribution, these plants are of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
