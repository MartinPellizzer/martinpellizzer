                    <h1>Alectra parasitica</h1>
<p>Alectra parasitica, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host trees for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, attaching itself to a variety of host species.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature makes it an important component of forest ecosystems, though it can sometimes cause stress to its host plants.</p>
