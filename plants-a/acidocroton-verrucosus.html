                <h1>Acidocroton verrucosus</h1>
<p>Acidocroton verrucosus, commonly known as the warty croton, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps or warts. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a complex inflorescence called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark and leaves contain toxic compounds, making it a plant with both ornamental and potentially harmful properties.</p>
<p>Acidocroton verrucosus thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidocroton verrucosus has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly waxy texture, ranging in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with yellow petals and stamens, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton verrucosus is primarily native to Jamaica.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the island's moist lowland forests and coastal areas. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in shaded undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a regionally important species within Jamaica.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton verrucosus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii, Guam, and the Mariana Islands.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activities, including accidental transport via shipping or intentional planting for ornamental or medicinal purposes. The plant has since established populations in these areas, often in disturbed habitats or along coastal regions. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive and compete with native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its spread, it is not currently considered a major threat to local ecosystems.</p>
