                <h1>Acidocroton verrucosus</h1>
<p>Acidocroton verrucosus, commonly known as the rough-leaved croton, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in panicles. Its growth habit is usually shrub-like, with multiple stems and a tendency to branch profusely.</p>
<p>Acidocroton verrucosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidocroton verrucosus has leaves that are alternate, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a rough, hairy texture and a dark green color on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, ridged bark that is typically brown to gray in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, helping it survive in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton verrucosus is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has expanded due to horticultural trade, with specimens now cultivated in tropical regions worldwide. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats. This species typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>While it is not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat faces threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acidocroton verrucosus is a vigorous, fast-growing shrub native to tropical regions, known for its dense foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for rapid root development. The plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in temperatures above 65°F (18°C) and entering dormancy during cooler months.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new shoots. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or citronella can help deter pests and enhance the plant's ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acidocroton verrucosus is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and fertility.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acidocroton verrucosus is a plant native to parts of Southeast Asia, known for its various uses and applications.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it has been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions due to its bioactive compounds. Its rubber-like sap has industrial applications, particularly in the production of natural rubber and adhesives. Culturally, the plant holds significance in local communities, where it is sometimes used in rituals or as a symbol of resilience.</p>
<p>However, its potential benefits are still being studied, and its use is often limited due to conservation concerns.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
