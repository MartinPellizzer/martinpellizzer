<p>Adinandra dasyantha, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, bark-like texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a leathery texture, while its flowers and fruits are often clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra dasyantha has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exhibits a slightly fibrous texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with four petals, blooming during the dry season, and is primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra dasyantha is primarily native to Sumatera.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this Indonesian island. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Sumatera.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra dasyantha was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high sunlight exposure and moderate to high rainfall. This plant is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally controlled to prevent potential ecological impacts on native flora.</p>
