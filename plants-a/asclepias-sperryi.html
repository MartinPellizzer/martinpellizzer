                    <h1>Asclepias sperryi</h1>
<p>Asclepias sperryi, commonly known as Sperry's milkweed, is a rare and federally endangered species native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milkweed sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in supporting the life cycle of the monarch butterfly and other native pollinators.</p>
