                    <h1>Asterostigma vermitoxicum</h1>
<p>Asterostigma vermitoxicum, commonly known as the toxic earthstar, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust root systems. The plant is notable for its unique, spiky fruiting structures that resemble a star, which aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers display a range of colors from yellow to purple.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores, contributing to its survival in competitive ecosystems.</p>
