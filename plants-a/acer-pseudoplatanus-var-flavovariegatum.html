<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. flavovariegatum, commonly known as the golden variegated maple, is a variant of the common maple tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking foliage, which features a mix of green, yellow, and white variegation. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a crisp texture and a slightly serrated margin. This plant thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil with partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. flavovariegatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, displaying a striking variegated pattern of yellow and green.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light grey bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in clusters, with greenish-yellow petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. flavovariegatum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in shady, moist environments such as forest understories. This variant typically occurs at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. flavovariegatum is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant yellow variegation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering faster results. The growth cycle involves a period of rapid growth in spring and early summer, followed by slower growth in late summer and autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun and requires regular watering during dry periods. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the tree and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or rosemary can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. flavovariegatum is a striking ornamental tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the aesthetic value of the landscape. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
