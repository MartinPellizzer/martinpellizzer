                <h1>Acrostichum pellucidomarginatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum pellucidomarginatum, commonly known as the glass-margin fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The leaves are typically light green with a translucent margin, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pellucidomarginatum has long, narrow leaves that are usually lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and can reach up to 30 cm in length, with a bright green color and translucent margins.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth texture and a light green color, growing upright with a somewhat climbing habit. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters during the summer months, with a greenish-white color and a wind-pollination method.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses its seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's spread.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pellucidomarginatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and near freshwater bodies such as rivers and lakes. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with tropical rainforests and mangrove ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pellucidomarginatum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where its preferred humid and shaded environments can be found.</p>
<p>It has been documented in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Caribbean. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as abandoned agricultural lands and along stream banks. Its introduction is likely due to human activities such as horticulture and land modification.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely unstudied in many of these areas.</p>
