                <h1>Acalypha monococca</h1>
<p>Acalypha monococca, commonly known as the single-seed euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in wetlands or near water sources.</p>
<p>Acalypha monococca is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha monococca has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually 3–6 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a smooth or slightly pubescent surface and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white bracts that resemble petals, and they bloom from summer to early autumn, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small, three-lobed schizocarp that splits into three one-seeded units, dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha monococca is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is now also cultivated in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, where it has been introduced for ornamental purposes. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, Acalypha monococca is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status due to its adaptability and widespread cultivation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha monococca is a fast-growing, ornamental shrub known for its vibrant, colorful leaves and compact size, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
