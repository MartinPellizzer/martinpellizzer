                <h1>Aechmea skinneri</h1>
<p>Aechmea skinneri, commonly known as the Skinner's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure that collects rainwater. The plant features vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically broad and sword-like, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Aechmea skinneri thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea skinneri has rosette-shaped leaves that are fleshy, broad, and pointed, arranged in a tight spiral around the central stem, with a dark green to blue-green coloration.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, covered in a fibrous, rough bark, and grows upright with a compact growth pattern. Its flowers are clustered in a spike at the center of the rosette, featuring bright red bracts with yellow-orange petals, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by bees and hummingbirds. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by animals consuming the flesh and excreting the seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and adapted for water storage, typical of bromeliads.</p>
