                        <h1>Acacia undosa</h1>
<p>Acacia undosa, commonly known as the undulating acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and phyllodes that are narrow and undulating in appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are arranged in cylindrical spikes. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a common adaptation in the Acacia genus to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acacia undosa is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia undosa belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their primitive vascular structures. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that typically have separate male and female reproductive structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which includes plants such as legumes and vetches, known for their ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, which is recognized for its distinctive pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees commonly found in arid regions, known for their needle-like leaves and often fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia undosa, a specific type of acacia characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to its native environment.</p>
