                    <h1>Acacia undosa</h1>
<p>Acacia undosa, commonly known as the undulating acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and phyllodes that are narrow and undulating in appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are arranged in cylindrical spikes. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a common adaptation in the Acacia genus to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acacia undosa is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
