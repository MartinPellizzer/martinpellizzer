                <h1>Achillea correvoniana</h1>
<p>Achillea correvoniana, commonly known as the Alpine Yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often with a slight woolly texture.</p>
<p>Achillea correvoniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea correvoniana has compound, finely divided leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a gray-green color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are arranged in flat-topped umbels, with white to pale yellow ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea correvoniana is a flowering plant native to the island of Corsica, where it grows in specific alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations on the island, primarily in rocky and gravelly soils. It thrives in high-altitude areas, typically between 1,200 and 2,000 meters above sea level. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from climate change and habitat degradation, it is classified as critically endangered.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to protect and preserve this rare species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea correvoniana is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in the fall. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea correvoniana is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering food and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea correvoniana contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea correvoniana is a plant known for its potential medicinal uses, including its traditional application in treating skin conditions and as an antiseptic.</p>
<p>It has also been used in herbal remedies for its anti-inflammatory properties. While it is not widely cultivated for culinary purposes, some local communities may use its leaves in small quantities. In terms of cultural significance, it is sometimes associated with healing and protection in folklore.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems, such as supporting pollinators, contributes to its importance in environmental conservation.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea correvoniana has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Purpurea' and 'Alba', which are known for their striking purple and white flowers respectively. While there are few natural hybrids of Achillea correvoniana, it is often crossbred with other achillea species to create new cultivars with enhanced traits. These plants hold horticultural importance due to their drought tolerance and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions.</p>
<p>They are commonly used in garden landscapes for their long-lasting blooms and low maintenance requirements.</p>
