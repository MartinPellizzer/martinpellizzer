                    <h1>Allotria</h1>
<p>Allotria, commonly known as the "false flower" or "false petal," is a unique botanical feature found in certain plants, particularly in the genus *Calyptrotus*.</p>
<p>It refers to structures that resemble petals but are not derived from the floral buds; instead, they are modified leaves or bracts. These structures often serve to attract pollinators or enhance the visual appeal of the flower. Allotria can be found in species such as *Calyptrotus grandiflorus*, where they are arranged in a showy, petal-like manner.</p>
<p>The presence of allotria is a specialized adaptation that highlights the diversity of floral morphology in the plant kingdom.</p>
