<p>Acacia arabica, commonly known as the frankincense tree, is a flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, thorny stems and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the formation of resinous gum, which is harvested for its aromatic properties. Acacia arabica thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with deep root systems.</p>
<p>Its ecological and cultural significance has made it a valuable species in traditional medicine and incense production.</p>
