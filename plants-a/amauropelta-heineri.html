                    <h1>Amauropelta heineri</h1>
<p>Amauropelta heineri, commonly known as the Heiner's shield fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the rainforests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are tightly clasped around the stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a compact growth habit. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
