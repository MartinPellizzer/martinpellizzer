<p>Ancylobothrys petersiana, commonly known as Peters' lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive on various substrates such as bark and stone. It is often found in temperate and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality and ecosystem health.</p>
