                    <h1>Anacampta tenuicornuta</h1>
<p>Anacampta tenuicornuta, commonly known as the slender-horned orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique morphology, including its finely divided leaves and delicate inflorescence, makes it a striking yet elusive species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
