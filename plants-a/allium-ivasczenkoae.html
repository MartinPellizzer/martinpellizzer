The plant produces small, clustered white or pale purple flowers during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, temperate climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
