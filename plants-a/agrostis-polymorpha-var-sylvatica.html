                    <h1>Agrostis polymorpha var. sylvatica</h1>
<p>Agrostis polymorpha var. sylvatica, commonly known as woodland bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on well-drained soils, often in woodland or shaded areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for ornamental purposes due to its fine texture and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
<p>This variety is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations.</p>
