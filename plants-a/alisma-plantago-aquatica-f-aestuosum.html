<p>Alisma plantago-aquatica f. aestuosum, commonly known as the fragrant water plantain, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically emerging from the water surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist areas effectively.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its distinctive aromatic scent, particularly noticeable when the flowers are in bloom.</p>
