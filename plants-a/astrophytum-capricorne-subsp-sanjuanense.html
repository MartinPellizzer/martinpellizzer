<p>Astrophytum capricorne subsp.</p>
<p>sanjuanense, commonly known as the San Juan hedgehog cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its short, spiny stems that resemble a hedgehog, with a compact growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
