                    <h1>Arceuthobium juniperi</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium juniperi, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to juniper trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex interaction with both the host tree and the dispersing agents.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its unique method of seed dispersal, where the seeds are ejected forcefully from the fruit.</p>
