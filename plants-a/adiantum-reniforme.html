                <h1>Adiantum reniforme</h1>
<p>Adiantum reniforme, commonly known as the Indian maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the shape of a heart or a kidney, hence its scientific name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Adiantum reniforme prefers shady, moist environments and is often found growing in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum reniforme has fern-like leaves that are reniform (kidney-shaped), with a delicate, finely divided structure, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 10–20 cm long, with a light green color and a slightly glossy surface. The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching.</p>
<p>Adiantum reniforme produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum reniforme is primarily native to the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Madeira, Malawi, Mauritius, Réunion, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments. It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. The plant is known for its delicate, fan-shaped fronds and is often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its native range spans across several African and Atlantic island territories.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum reniforme was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, delicate fronds and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses as a decorative plant. The distribution of this species has expanded beyond its native range in Southeast Asia to parts of North America and Europe. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
