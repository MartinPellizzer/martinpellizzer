                <h1>Acinodendron acalephoides</h1>
<p>Acinodendron acalephoides, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron acalephoides has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron acalephoides is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest understories and along stream banks. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary forests and is not widely distributed outside its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a regional endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron acalephoides was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental or for horticultural purposes.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, making it suitable for areas with high rainfall and mild winters. The plant is typically found in disturbed sites, such as along roadsides or in degraded forests, where it can quickly establish itself. Its introduction has led to its spread in several countries, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely undocumented, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness in new habitats.</p>
