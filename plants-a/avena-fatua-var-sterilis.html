                    <h1>Avena fatua var. sterilis</h1>
<p>Avena fatua var. sterilis, commonly known as goatgrass, is a sterile variant of the wild oat plant.</p>
<p>It is a grass species native to Europe and Asia, characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds, which limits its ability to spread naturally.</p>
<p>This variant is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas due to its competitive growth.</p>
