                <h1>Achnatherum chinense</h1>
<p>Achnatherum chinense, commonly known as Chinese needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum chinense has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in length from 10 to 30 centimeters with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, growing upright and branching towards the top. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to yellowish flowers, which bloom in early summer and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are tiny and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum chinense is primarily native to China, Mongolia, and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, steppes, and mountainous regions. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with open habitats and can be found at elevations ranging from lowlands to moderate mountain areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the natural vegetation patterns of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum chinense was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states like California, Oregon, and Washington.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in dry, disturbed soils. The plant has since spread beyond its initial introduction sites, becoming established in various habitats including roadsides and open grasslands. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some regions.</p>
<p>Despite its introduced status, it is often considered a native species in parts of its range in Asia.</p>
