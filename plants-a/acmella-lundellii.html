                <h1>Acmella lundellii</h1>
<p>Acmella lundellii, commonly known as the yellow horned violet, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with a prominent central spur. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Acmella lundellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella lundellii has leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a deep green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a slightly rough texture. The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanging throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and relying primarily on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when the capsule matures and dries.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella lundellii is primarily native to Belize and Guatemala.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in the tropical regions of these Central American countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its small, brightly colored flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Belize and Guatemala.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella lundellii was mainly introduced to the western Pacific, particularly in regions such as Queensland, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and saline environments, where it thrives in brackish water conditions. The plant has been documented in mangrove ecosystems and tidal flats, often as an opportunistic colonizer in disturbed or saline habitats. Its introduction has been associated with human activities such as land reclamation and coastal development.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential in certain areas, it plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
