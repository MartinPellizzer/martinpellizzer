<p>Agave noah, commonly known as the Noah's ark agave, is a succulent plant native to the dry regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color and form a rosette shape. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears yellowish-green inflorescences, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it highly drought-resistant.</p>
<p>Agave noah is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
