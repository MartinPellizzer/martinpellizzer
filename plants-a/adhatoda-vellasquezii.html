<p>Adhatoda vellasquezii, commonly known as the Madagascar arum, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and showy, spadix-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Its unique botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Adhatoda vellasquezii is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda vellasquezii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and greenish-brown in color, with a climbing growth pattern that allows it to ascend supports. Its flowers are tubular with five lobes, typically purple or violet in color, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, enabling the plant to spread vegetatively and anchor itself in moist soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda vellasquezii is a rare and little-known plant native to the Andean region of South America, specifically found in parts of Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of North America and Europe, primarily through horticultural trade. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes, often growing in areas with high humidity. This species is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Adhatoda vellasquezii is considered endangered, with limited populations and ongoing conservation efforts to protect it.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
