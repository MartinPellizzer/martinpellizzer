                <h1>Adhatoda vellasquezii</h1>
<p>Adhatoda vellasquezii, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It has a woody stem and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Adhatoda vellasquezii is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda vellasquezii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; they are typically 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with blue or violet petals, and they bloom during the rainy season; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda vellasquezii is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats due to its adaptability to varying soil conditions. Its distribution is largely restricted to the Andean foothills and adjacent lowland forests.</p>
<p>Adhatoda vellasquezii plays an important ecological role in these regions, supporting local biodiversity and contributing to the understory vegetation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda vellasquezii was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering characteristics.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in parts of Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and some regions of the southern United States. Although not widely distributed, it has occasionally been reported in garden settings and botanical collections. Its introduction is primarily associated with horticultural trade rather than natural dispersal.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most of these regions.</p>
