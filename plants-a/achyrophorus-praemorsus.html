                <h1>Achyrophorus praemorsus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus praemorsus, commonly known as the death cap mushroom, is a highly toxic species of fungus belonging to the Amanita genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by a white, bulbous cap that turns yellow with age, and a distinct ring around the stem. The fruiting bodies typically grow in woodlands, often near dead or decaying trees. It is particularly dangerous because it closely resembles edible mushrooms, leading to accidental poisoning.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is considered one of the most lethal mushrooms in the world.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus praemorsus has leaves that are broad, ovate, and glossy green, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a rough, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus praemorsus is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, including swamps and marshes. This plant thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils and is often associated with riparian zones. Its distribution extends from North Carolina to Florida, with some populations in Georgia and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the wetland ecosystems in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus praemorsus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in roadsides, abandoned fields, and along railway tracks where the soil has been disturbed. This species thrives in full sun and is tolerant of poor soil conditions, which allows it to spread rapidly in these environments. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can outcompete native plant species and alter local ecosystems.</p>
