                    <h1>Athyriopsis × lobatocrenata</h1>
<p>Athyriopsis × lobatocrenata, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Athyriopsis filix-femina and Athyriopsis crenata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests or woodland areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
