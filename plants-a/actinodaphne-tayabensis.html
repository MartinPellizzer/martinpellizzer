<p>Actinodaphne tayabensis, commonly known as the Philippine laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible drupes that are often used in local cuisine.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne tayabensis has elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows as an upright shrub or small tree.
