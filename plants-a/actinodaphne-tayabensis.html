<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne tayabensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slight longitudinal ridging, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white in color, with a simple structure consisting of four sepals and four petals, blooming during the dry season and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical berry that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne tayabensis is a species of flowering plant native to the Philippines, specifically found in the northern part of the island of Luzon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within the Cordillera Administrative Region. It thrives in moist, shaded understory environments of montane forests. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Actinodaphne tayabensis is considered critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne tayabensis is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and fragrant leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within several years, making it suitable for long-term cultivation.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining, fertile soil and requires consistent watering without waterlogging. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth. It is relatively pest and disease-resistant but may be affected by scale insects or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants can enhance its growth and create a lush, vibrant garden space.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
