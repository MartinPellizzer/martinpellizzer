                <h1>Achillea vermiculata</h1>
<p>Achillea vermiculata, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Achillea vermiculata is often used in herbal medicine and as a ornamental plant in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea vermiculata has leaves that are basal, forming a rosette, with lanceolate to ovate shapes, dark green in color, and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-gray bark, growing in a丛生 pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea vermiculata is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is now found in parts of western North America, including some areas of Washington and British Columbia. This species thrives in dry, open environments such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea vermiculata is listed as a species of concern in some regions due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea vermiculata is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the root clumps in early spring. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, blooming in early summer and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape.</p>
<p>It is generally pest and disease resistant but may attract aphids or slugs, and it pairs well with other drought-tolerant plants like lavender or yarrow in companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea vermiculata is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, by offering shelter and habitat in its dense foliage. This plant acts as an effective erosion control species due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil. Additionally, it serves as a companion plant for other garden species by improving soil structure and promoting biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its ecological benefits make it an important component of sustainable and wildlife-friendly landscapes.</p>
