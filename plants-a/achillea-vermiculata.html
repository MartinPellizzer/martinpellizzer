                <h1>Achillea vermiculata</h1>
<p>Achillea vermiculata, commonly known as white yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 centimeters. The plant features finely divided, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its common name is derived from the Greek myth of Achilles, who supposedly used the plant to treat wounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea vermiculata has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green to grayish color, growing from the base to form a compact plant. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind and insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea vermiculata is primarily native to southern Europe, including regions such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of southern France.</p>
<p>It is also found in North Africa, extending into countries like Morocco and Algeria. This plant thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is commonly seen in rocky or coastal areas, where it adapts well to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of the Middle East, such as Turkey and Syria, where it grows in similar ecological settings.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea vermiculata was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas, becoming a common weed in disturbed soils across the continent. The plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including roadsides, fields, and waste areas, contributing to its widespread distribution. Its ability to reproduce both sexually and vegetatively has facilitated its establishment in new regions.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential varies by location, with some areas experiencing significant ecological impacts.</p>
