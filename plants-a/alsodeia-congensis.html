<p>Alsodeia congensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alsike, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. It produces small, edible seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance makes it a valued plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
