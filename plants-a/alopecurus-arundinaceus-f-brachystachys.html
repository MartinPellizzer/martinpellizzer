                    <h1>Alopecurus arundinaceus f. brachystachys</h1>
<p>Alopecurus arundinaceus f. brachystachys, commonly known as the dwarf reed grass, is a compact, clump-forming perennial grass that thrives in moist to wet environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically shorter than those of the standard species. This form is characterized by its reduced inflorescence, which gives it a more compact appearance compared to the typical alopecurus. It is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens.</p>
