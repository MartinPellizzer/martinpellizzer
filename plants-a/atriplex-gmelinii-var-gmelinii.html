<p>Atriplex gmelinii var. gmelinii, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is highly adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing coastal and desert environments. Its leaves contain high levels of minerals, which have been used historically by indigenous peoples for both culinary and medicinal purposes.</p>
