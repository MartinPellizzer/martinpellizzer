<p>Acalypha radians var. geraniifolia, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with prominent red veins that create a striking contrast. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its attractive foliage, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha radians var. geraniifolia has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a slightly serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, often with a reddish or purple tinge at the base. The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age, and it exhibits a trailing or prostrate growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and stamens; they bloom in summer, and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous, helping to stabilize the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha radians var. geraniifolia is a variant of the species native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited, with populations primarily found in protected areas and botanical gardens. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests and understory habitats. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha radians var. geraniifolia is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering the most reliable and rapid results. This plant thrives in a warm, humid environment with a growth cycle that includes active growth during spring and summer, followed by a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer every few weeks during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage bushier growth.
