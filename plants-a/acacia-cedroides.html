                    <h1>Acacia cedroides</h1>
<p>Acacia cedroides, commonly known as the African silver acacia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched trunk and dense, feathery foliage composed of bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia cedroides is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas.</p>
