<p>Arenaria gerardi, commonly known as Gerardi's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It typically features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or dry streambeds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
