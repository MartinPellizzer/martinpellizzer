                        <h1>Abrus precatorius var. erythrospermus</h1>
<p>Abrus precatorius var. erythrospermus, commonly known as the red-seeded devil's bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red or orange seeds enclosed in a flat, bean-shaped pod. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its toxic properties, as the seeds contain potent lectins that can be harmful if ingested.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus precatorius var. erythrospermus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of India, particularly in the southern and eastern regions. This variant is commonly distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in open areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed habitats. The plant is known for its striking red seeds, which are used in traditional practices and as ornamental elements.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to the Pacific islands as well, where it has been introduced and naturalized in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus precatorius var. erythrospermus was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its striking red seeds and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation. The plant's rapid growth and seed dispersal through animal droppings contribute to its spread.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
