<p>Asplenium howeanum, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit. The plant features lance-shaped, glossy, dark green fronds that are often clustered at the base. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The sporangia are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of ferns, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
