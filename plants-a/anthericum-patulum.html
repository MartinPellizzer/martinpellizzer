<p>Anthericum patulum, commonly known as the broadleaf lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features grass-like, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces striking, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Anthericum patulum is often found in woodland areas and along the edges of wetlands.</p>
