                <h1>Aconitum isidzukae</h1>
<p>Aconitum isidzukae, commonly known as the Isidzuka aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, spikelike inflorescences. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum isidzukae contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum isidzukae has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and greenish, with a slightly hairy texture, and grows in a straight, upright pattern. Its flowers are blue to purple, forming dense spikes with showy, spurred petals, and bloom in late summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, thick, and fibrous, aiding in the plant's survival in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum isidzukae is primarily native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent mountain ranges in western China.</p>
<p>It is found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 3,500 to 5,000 meters. This plant is endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, with limited occurrences in neighboring areas of Nepal and northern India. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum isidzukae was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in woodland or forested regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. The plant is known for its striking blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas where it can spread through its rhizomes.</p>
<p>However, it is considered toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
