                    <h1>Alnus nervosus</h1>
<p>Alnus nervosus, commonly known as the narrow-veined alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely veined, alternate leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that release seeds when mature. Alnus nervosus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation.</p>
