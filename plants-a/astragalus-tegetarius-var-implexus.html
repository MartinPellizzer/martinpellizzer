                    <h1>Astragalus tegetarius var. implexus</h1>
<p>Astragalus tegetarius var. implexus, commonly known as the twisted milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
