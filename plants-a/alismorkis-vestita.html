<p>Alismorkis vestita, commonly known as the naked waterplant, is a member of the Alismarceae family and is native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are often hairless, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, and its flowers are small and clustered, often with three petals. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of wetland health.</p>
