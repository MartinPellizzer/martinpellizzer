                <h1>Acer angustilobum var. sichourense</h1>
<p>Acer angustilobum var. sichourense, commonly known as the Sichuan maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the autumn. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often developing shallow fissures as the tree matures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer angustilobum var. sichourense has leaves that are narrow and elongated, typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a doubly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and they range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, turning vibrant yellow in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer angustilobum var. sichourense is a rare variant of the narrow-leaf maple native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in Sichuan Province.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within its native range, where it grows in humid, cool climates. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, typically at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer angustilobum var. sichourense is a unique maple variety known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or softwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials enhances its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer angustilobum var. sichourense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers and produces berries that serve as a food source for birds. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of ecological interactions. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer angustilobum var. sichourense is a lesser-known maple species primarily valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture due to its striking foliage and unique leaf shape.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves can be processed for medicinal purposes in traditional Chinese medicine, where they are believed to have anti-inflammatory properties. The tree also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species, contributing to industrial and economic activities related to conservation and tourism. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions of China, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications are more ecological and aesthetic than commercial, though it remains an important species for botanical research and landscape design.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer angustilobum var. sichourense has several popular cultivars that are favored for their ornamental value, including 'Autumn Flame' and 'Sichourense,' which are known for their striking fall color and unique leaf shapes.</p>
<p>It also has been used in hybridization with other maple species to produce cultivars with enhanced hardiness and foliage characteristics. These hybrids often exhibit improved adaptability to different climates and soils, making them valuable in horticulture. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to add visual interest to gardens with its vibrant autumn display.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability, it is increasingly cultivated in both public and private landscapes.</p>
