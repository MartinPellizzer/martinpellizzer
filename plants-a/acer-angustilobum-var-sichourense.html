<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer angustilobum var. sichourense is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>This variant of the narrow-leaf maple is found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in temperate climates with high elevation and is often associated with mixed forests. The plant is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora and is sometimes used in traditional landscaping.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer angustilobum var. sichourense was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as an ornamental tree due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in regions with temperate climates.
