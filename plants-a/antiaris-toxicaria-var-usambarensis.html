                    <h1>Antiaris toxicaria var. usambarensis</h1>
<p>Antiaris toxicaria var. usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara breadfruit, is a variant of the African breadfruit tree native to the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is a large, evergreen tree characterized by its thick, flaky bark and broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces large, yellowish-white flowers that are typically followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, this species is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions.</p>
