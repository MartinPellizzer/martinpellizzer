                <h1>Acomis rutidosea</h1>
<p>Acomis rutidosea, commonly known as the roughleaf panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides and in wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers.</p>
<p>Acomis rutidosea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acomis rutidosea has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unbranched. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomis rutidosea is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with disturbed or transitional habitats. It is an herbaceous perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomis rutidosea was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Florida in the early 20th century. The plant was likely introduced through horticultural trade or accidental transport. It has since spread to other parts of the southeastern U.S., including Georgia and South Carolina.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
