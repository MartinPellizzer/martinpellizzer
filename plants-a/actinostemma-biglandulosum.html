                <h1>Actinostemma biglandulosum</h1>
<p>Actinostemma biglandulosum, commonly known as the large-leaved actinostemma, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure supports its role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemma biglandulosum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a rough, hairy texture, and has a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread horizontally just beneath the soil surface, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemma biglandulosum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically found in states such as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland habitats, including swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This species is commonly associated with sandy or peaty soils and is often found in areas with high humidity and abundant moisture. It is an herbaceous plant that typically grows in dense stands, forming a part of the understory vegetation in these moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemma biglandulosum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads rapidly through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
