                <h1>Actinostemma biglandulosum</h1>
<p>Actinostemma biglandulosum, commonly known as the broad-leaved actinostemma, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in distinctive glands, giving it its species name "biglandulosum.". The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and stems that are often hairy.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemma biglandulosum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are usually green and have a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark that is dark brown and has a fibrous texture, growing upright with some branching. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemma biglandulosum is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations within its native range, with some specimens found in botanical gardens and conservation facilities. It thrives in temperate forest environments, often growing in shaded, moist areas with well-drained soil. This species is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural reproduction, Actinostemma biglandulosum is classified as endangered, requiring continued conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinostemma biglandulosum is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with division being the most reliable method for faster establishment. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, typically blooming in early summer and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinostemma biglandulosum is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit offers shelter and nesting sites for small mammals and insects. It acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by improving soil conditions. Additionally, its extensive root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>The plant also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and maintaining the health of local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Actinostemma biglandulosum is a plant that has limited known uses and applications.</p>
<p>It is not widely used in culinary contexts due to its lack of flavor and potential toxicity. In medicinal applications, it has been studied for its possible anti-inflammatory properties, though research is still in early stages. Industrially, it may have potential in biotechnology for its unique chemical compounds.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is not prominently featured in traditional symbolism or practices.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Actinostemma biglandulosum has several varieties and cultivars that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegatum' and 'Lividum', which are noted for their striking foliage patterns. Hybrids of this species are less common but have been developed to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and growth habit. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its unique leaf morphology.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is often used in woodland gardens and as a ground cover.</p>
