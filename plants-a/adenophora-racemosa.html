                <h1>Adenophora racemosa</h1>
<p>Adenophora racemosa, commonly known as blue flax, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands.</p>
<p>Adenophora racemosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora racemosa has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2–5 cm long and 0.5–1 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and grows upright, with a grayish-green color and a somewhat rough texture. Its flowers are clustered in racemes, featuring bell-shaped, white to pale blue petals with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora racemosa is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist to mesic habitats such as woodlands, meadows, and stream banks. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with rich, well-drained soils. Its distribution extends from southern Ontario and New York westward to Minnesota and southward to Texas.</p>
<p>Adenophora racemosa is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is known for its showy blue or violet flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora racemosa was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full to partial sunlight. This plant is commonly found in the northern United States and parts of Canada. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in many regions where it has established itself.</p>
