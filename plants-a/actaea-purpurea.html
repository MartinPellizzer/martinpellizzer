                <h1>Actaea purpurea</h1>
<p>Actaea purpurea, commonly known as red baneberry, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking red berries that appear in late summer. The plant features compound leaves with five to seven leaflets and produces white, clustered flowers in early summer. Its toxic properties make it a plant to be handled with care.</p>
<p>The berries are particularly poisonous to humans and animals, containing cardiotoxic compounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea purpurea has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are typically 15â€“30 cm in length, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are serrated and have a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth, slender, and somewhat hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age, and it grows upright with a single stem. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers with five petals and a central cluster of stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a red, berry-like aggregate known as a follicle, which contains numerous small seeds dispersed by birds and through the shedding of the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form colonies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea purpurea is primarily native to China North-Central, China South-Central, and China Southeast.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in these regions, growing in forested areas and moist environments. It thrives in temperate climates with partial to full shade. The species is known for its striking purple flowers and is often used in horticulture.</p>
<p>Its native range highlights its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions within these parts of China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea purpurea was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly as part of horticultural trade and ornamental plant cultivation.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond its original cultivation sites, establishing populations in various natural and disturbed habitats. The plant's introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain regions. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its presence in non-native environments highlights the ecological impacts of introduced species.</p>
