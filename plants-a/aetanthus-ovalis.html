<p>Aetanthus ovalis, commonly known as the oval sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Aetanthus ovalis is often found in dunes, gravel plains, and other xerophytic habitats.</p>
