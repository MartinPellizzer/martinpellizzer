                <h1>Adiantum meishanianum</h1>
<p>Adiantum meishanianum, commonly known as the Meishan maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive rachis that is slightly notched, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum meishanianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum meishanianum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, finely serrated margin and a pale green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, erect, and covered with a smooth, light green bark. This plant does not produce flowers; instead, it reproduces via spores, and its reproductive structures are hidden within the leaf fronds. The roots are rhizoidal, forming a dense network beneath the soil to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant's overall morphology is adapted for shade-tolerant growth in moist, forested environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum meishanianum is primarily native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the island, particularly in humid and shaded forest environments. This fern thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Taiwan's subtropical climate.</p>
<p>It is an endemic species, meaning it is not found naturally anywhere else in the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum meishanianum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This fern is known for its delicate, lace-like fronds and ability to thrive in humid conditions. It has been observed spreading along the coastal areas of Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
