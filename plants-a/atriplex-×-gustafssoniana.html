<p>Atriplex × gustafssoniana, commonly known as the hybrid saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Atriplex nummularia and Atriplex semibaccata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is notable for its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Atriplex × gustafssoniana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
