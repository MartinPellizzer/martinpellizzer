The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in shaded, moist forest environments.</p>
<p>The hairy texture of its stems and leaves gives it its common name and distinguishes it from other species in the genus.</p>
