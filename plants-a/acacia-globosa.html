                        <h1>Acacia globosa</h1>
<p>Acacia globosa, commonly known as the globular acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has phyllodes, which are modified leaf stalks that function as leaves, and these are often covered in fine hairs. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Acacia globosa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia globosa is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia, including parts of South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and shrublands. This species is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate high temperatures. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Acacia globosa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native animals.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia globosa was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. This plant thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it well-suited for rehabilitation of degraded lands. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it has been introduced to several regions for ecological restoration and as a windbreak species.</p>
