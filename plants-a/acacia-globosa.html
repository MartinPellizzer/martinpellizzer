<p>Acacia globosa, commonly known as the globular acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has phyllodes, which are modified leaf stalks that function as leaves, and these are often covered in fine hairs. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Acacia globosa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its environment.</p>
