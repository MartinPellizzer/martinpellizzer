<p>Arceuthobium campylopodum subsp.</p>
<p>microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the stems of its host, typically coniferous trees. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and berries that are dispersed by wind or animals. It is found in various regions of North America, particularly in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
