                <h1>Acrostichum tonduzii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum tonduzii, commonly known as the Tonduz's brake fern, is a species of fern native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense carpet of foliage.</p>
<p>The fronds are leathery and have a unique, almost architectural appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tonduzii has large, pinnately compound leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 2 meters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, often silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a fibrous texture, and it grows in dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are released once the fruit dries and becomes airborne.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tonduzii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and swampy areas where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. This species is also present in parts of New Guinea and the western Pacific islands. It typically grows along riverbanks and in coastal mangrove swamps, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific ecological conditions, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tonduzii was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like South Africa, Namibia, and Angola.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or rocky shores where it thrives in saline and well-drained soils. This plant is often used for dune stabilization due to its ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions. Its introduction has been both natural and anthropogenic, spreading through seed dispersal by wind and water.</p>
<p>However, its presence in these areas is now considered part of the local flora.</p>
