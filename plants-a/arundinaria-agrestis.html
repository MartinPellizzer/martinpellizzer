                    <h1>Arundinaria agrestis</h1>
<p>Arundinaria agrestis, commonly known as the common bamboo, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height, forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in panicles during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slight sheen, contributing to its ornamental appeal in moist environments.</p>
