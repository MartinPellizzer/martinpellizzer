<p>Acantholimon restiaceum, commonly known as the coastal flax or sea flax, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and showy blue to purple flowers. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and rocky shores, often in areas with strong winds and salt spray. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disruption, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>
