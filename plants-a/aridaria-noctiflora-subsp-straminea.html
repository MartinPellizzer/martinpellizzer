<p>Aridaria noctiflora subsp.</p>
<p>straminea, commonly known as the silver night-flower, is a rare and striking plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces fragrant, star-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent leaves store water, enabling it to survive prolonged dry periods.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
