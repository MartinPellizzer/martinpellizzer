                    <h1>Arrhenatherum elatius var. submuticum</h1>
<p>Arrhenatherum elatius var. submuticum, commonly known as the slender wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually slightly hairy, and its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This variety is often distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Arrhenatherum elatius.</p>
