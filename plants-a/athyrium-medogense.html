                    <h1>Athyrium medogense</h1>
<p>Athyrium medogense, commonly known as the Medog fern, is a species native to the Himalayan region, particularly in China.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of its foliage.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns in this genus.</p>
