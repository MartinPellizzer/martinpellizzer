                    <h1>Armeria maritima var. arenaria</h1>
<p>Armeria maritima var. arenaria, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in sandy, salty soils. It is well-adapted to harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it an effective dune stabilizer and a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
