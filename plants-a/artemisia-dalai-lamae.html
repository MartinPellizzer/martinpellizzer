                    <h1>Artemisia dalai-lamae</h1>
<p>Artemisia dalai-lamae, commonly known as the Dalai Lama's wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant is noted for its strong, camphor-like scent, which is attributed to the presence of essential oils such as thujone and camphor. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>This species is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>
