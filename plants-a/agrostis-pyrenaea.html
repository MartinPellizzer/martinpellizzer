                    <h1>Agrostis pyrenaea</h1>
<p>Agrostis pyrenaea, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
