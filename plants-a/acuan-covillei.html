                <h1>Acuan covillei</h1>
<p>Acuan covillei, commonly known as the Coville's acuan, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acuan covillei is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for botanical research and ecological studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acuan covillei has narrow, elongated leaves that are linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a pale green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanging as the plant matures. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after drying.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan covillei is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This plant thrives in moist to saturated soils and is often associated with disturbed or open areas. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native wetland environments.</p>
<p>Acuan covillei is also occasionally found in Louisiana and Texas, though it is less common in those regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan covillei was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in the southeastern United States. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas quickly. It is often considered an invasive species due to its competitive nature.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, impacting local ecosystems.</p>
