                <h1>Achillea adulterina</h1>
<p>Achillea adulterina, commonly known as lesser yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, thread-like phyllaries that surround the central disk flowers. Its leaves are basal, feather-like, and arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Achillea adulterina is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, and it is known for its medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea adulterina has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to brownish bark, growing in a bushy pattern. Its flowers are small, composite heads with white to pale yellow ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea adulterina is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in parts of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as Italy, France, Spain, and Turkey, though it is now considered rare. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats like rocky slopes and open woodlands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Achillea adulterina is listed as a vulnerable species in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea adulterina is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. The growth cycle of Achillea adulterina includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea adulterina is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including insects and small birds, which rely on its flowers for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by attracting beneficial insects. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea adulterina contributes to biodiversity by supporting a variety of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea adulterina is a flowering plant known for its historical and potential medicinal uses, though specific applications are not well-documented.</p>
<p>It may have been used in traditional herbal remedies for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. While it is not widely cultivated for culinary purposes, it could be explored for ornamental use in gardens due to its attractive yellow flowers. Its role in cultural symbolism is unclear, but it may have held significance in ancient botanical practices.</p>
<p>Due to limited research, its industrial or economic applications remain largely unknown.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea adulterina has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' and 'Purpurea', which are known for their striking yellow and purple foliage, respectively. While hybrids of Achillea adulterina are less common, some crossbreeding with related species like Achillea millefolium has produced plants with enhanced color and vigor. These cultivars are widely used in gardens for their drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea adulterina holds significant horticultural importance as a versatile plant suitable for rock gardens, borders, and naturalized landscapes.</p>
