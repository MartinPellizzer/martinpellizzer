                <h1>Achillea adulterina</h1>
<p>Achillea adulterina, commonly known as false yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its flowers are usually white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea adulterina has basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are grey-green in color, arranged in a rosette, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with fine hairs, with a pale green to reddish-brown bark. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding orange disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a cylindrical achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea adulterina is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as southern France, Italy, Spain, and the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in dry, open habitats like rocky slopes, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea adulterina is a perennial flowering plant known for its hardy nature and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rootstock in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The growth cycle of Achillea adulterina begins with new growth in spring, followed by flowering in late summer, and it goes dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea adulterina is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including insects and small birds, which rely on its flowers for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide array of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea adulterina is a lesser-known member of the Asteraceae family, primarily recognized for its potential medicinal uses.</p>
