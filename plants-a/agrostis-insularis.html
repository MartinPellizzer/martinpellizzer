                    <h1>Agrostis insularis</h1>
<p>Agrostis insularis, commonly known as the island bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems and coastal meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny seeds. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit helps prevent erosion and supports local biodiversity.</p>
