                <h1>Aechmea hoppii</h1>
<p>Aechmea hoppii, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and nutrients. The plant produces a tall flower spike with vibrant, spathaceous bracts that range in color from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aechmea hoppii is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea hoppii has rosette-shaped leaves that are sword-like, stiff, and arranged in a compact circle, with a waxy blue-green color and a sharp, pointed tip.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, thick, underground stem with a fibrous, rough texture and a grayish-brown color. Its flowers are clustered in a spike at the center of the rosette, with white petals and a yellow center, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the air and soil.</p>
