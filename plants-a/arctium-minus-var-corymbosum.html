<p>Arctium minus var. corymbosum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of purple to pink flowers, which are followed by spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas.</p>
<p>The plant has been used historically for its medicinal properties, particularly for its purported skin-soothing effects.</p>
