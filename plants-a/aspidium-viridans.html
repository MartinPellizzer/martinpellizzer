                    <h1>Aspidium viridans</h1>
<p>Aspidium viridans, commonly known as the green wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and woodland areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called a indusium.</p>
<p>Aspidium viridans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage.</p>
