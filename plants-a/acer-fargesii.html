                <h1>Acer fargesii</h1>
<p>Acer fargesii, commonly known as the Farges maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and has a rounded, often multi-stemmed crown. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and appear in clusters, while its fruit is a samara with a winged seed.</p>
<p>Acer fargesii is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer fargesii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a doubly serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 12 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in clusters, with yellow-green sepals and stamens, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and help anchor the tree in its mountainous habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer fargesii is a species of maple native to eastern China, specifically found in the provinces of Sichuan, Hubei, and western Hunan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Himalayas and adjacent regions in northern India and Nepal. It thrives in temperate climates, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils within mountainous environments. This species is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acer fargesii is listed as a vulnerable species in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer fargesii is a deciduous tree known for its striking red and gold autumn foliage, commonly cultivated in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seed propagation requiring a cold stratification period to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acer fargesii involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning is best done in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead or diseased branches.</p>
<p>Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while diseases like powdery mildew can affect the tree, making companion planting with pest-repelling plants like marigolds or lavender beneficial.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer fargesii is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and protecting water quality.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer fargesii plays a role in maintaining the overall health of mountainous habitats through its ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer fargesii is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>It is primarily used in horticulture as a decorative plant due to its vibrant autumn foliage, making it a popular choice in parks and gardens. While not commonly consumed, some parts of the tree have been used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Its presence in forest ecosystems supports biodiversity, contributing to the economic value of local communities through ecotourism and sustainable forestry.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and natural beauty, often featured in Chinese art and literature.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer fargesii has several popular cultivars, including 'Diablo', 'Atrosanguineum', and 'Twinleaf', which are valued for their striking foliage and ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>It is also involved in the creation of various hybrids, such as with Acer griseum, resulting in plants that exhibit enhanced cold hardiness and unique leaf patterns. These cultivars and hybrids are highly sought after in horticulture for their ability to thrive in shaded environments and their vibrant autumn colors. Due to their adaptability and visual appeal, they play a significant role in landscape design and garden aesthetics.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer fargesii contributes greatly to the diversity and beauty of cultivated maple trees.</p>
