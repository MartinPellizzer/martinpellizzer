<p>Armeniaca sibirica f. pubescens, commonly known as the Siberian apricot or hairy apricot, is a botanical variant of the apricot species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy foliage and fruit, which are typically smaller and more tart than those of the standard apricot. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, often growing in dry, rocky soils. Its flowers are white or pale pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves, and it produces edible fruits that are used in culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
<p>The hairy pubescence on its leaves and stems is a distinguishing feature of this particular form.</p>
