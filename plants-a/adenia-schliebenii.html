                <h1>Adenia schliebenii</h1>
<p>Adenia schliebenii, commonly known as the Schlieben's adenium, is a striking shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its thick, swollen trunk and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, attracting various pollinators. Its unique morphology and adaptability to arid environments make it a notable species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adenia schliebenii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in botanical gardens around the world.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia schliebenii has elliptic to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and a prominent green calyx, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<p>This plant is found in the eastern and southern regions of these countries. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical areas with moist, well-drained soils. Adenia schliebenii is often found in forested or wooded habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these two African nations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia schliebenii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value. The plant is typically found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils. It has been introduced as a garden plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits.</p>
