                        <h1>Acalypha leandrii</h1>
<p>Acalypha leandrii, commonly known as the golden torch or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow bracts that surround small, inconspicuous flowers, creating a visually appealing display. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Acalypha leandrii is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as birds and insects due to its vibrant colors and nectar-rich flowers.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha leandrii belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of secondary cell walls and complex reproductive structures. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and diverse reproductive strategies. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with a wide range of morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a group of flowering plants known for their diverse forms and often containing species with specialized adaptations for various environments. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with a wide variety of growth forms and often produces milky sap. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupplant," characterized by their showy inflorescences and often hairy foliage.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha leandrii, a specific type within the genus Acalypha, distinguished by its unique morphological traits and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha leandrii is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the diverse ecosystems of this island nation, which is known for its unique and endemic flora. The plant thrives in humid, tropical conditions typical of Madagascar's climate. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and shrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species to the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha leandrii was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its vibrant foliage and unique leaf patterns. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is generally not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk in most environments.</p>
