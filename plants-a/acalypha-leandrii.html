<p>Acalypha leandrii, commonly known as the purpleleaf ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that range in color from green to purple. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its bark is thick and rugged, providing it with a degree of resistance to drought and herbivory.</p>
<p>Acalypha leandrii is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha leandrii has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, blooming during the summer months, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha leandrii is a species native to the island of Madagascar, where it is found in specific regions of the eastern rainforests.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely confined to its native habitat, though it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens outside Madagascar. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soils. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acalypha leandrii is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique species.</p>
