                    <h1>Artemisia absinthium</h1>
<p>Artemisia absinthium, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-green, feathery foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains compounds like thujone, which contribute to its distinctive aroma and historical use in absinthe. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its medicinal and culinary uses have been documented for centuries, though its high thujone content makes it potentially toxic in large doses.</p>
