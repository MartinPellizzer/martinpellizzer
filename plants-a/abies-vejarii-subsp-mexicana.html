                        <h1>Abies vejarii subsp. mexicana</h1>
<p>Abies vejarii subsp.</p>
<p>mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the genus Abies, which includes various species of fir trees characterized by their cone-like structures and needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>The Mexican fir typically grows in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates, often reaching heights of up to 20 meters. Its foliage is dense and dark green, with short, stiff needles that provide a dense canopy.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting diverse wildlife and contributing to forest biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies vejarii subsp.</p>
<p>mexicana is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico, particularly in the states of Guanajuato, Jalisco, and Michoac√°n. It grows in high-altitude forests, typically at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often found in pine-oak forests. It is commonly associated with the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre del Sur mountain ranges.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies vejarii subsp.</p>
<p>mexicana was mainly introduced to the western United States and parts of California. It is commonly found in mountainous regions with high elevation and cool, moist climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. It has been introduced to areas where its native range does not naturally extend.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
