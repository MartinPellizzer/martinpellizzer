                        <h1>Abutilodes carolinianum</h1>
<p>Abutilodes carolinianum, commonly known as the Carolina thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas.</p>
<p>Abutilodes carolinianum is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilodes carolinianum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with coastal and inland wetlands. It is an important component of the flora in these ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and ecological stability.</p>
<p>However, its distribution has become fragmented due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilodes carolinianum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, pastures, and along stream banks. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its spread has been documented in several states including Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive nature, it requires careful management to prevent further encroachment into natural ecosystems.</p>
