                    <h1>Ascidieria verticillaris</h1>
<p>Ascidieria verticillaris, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, showy yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its roots are shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb moisture from a wide area.</p>
<p>Ascidieria verticillaris is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
