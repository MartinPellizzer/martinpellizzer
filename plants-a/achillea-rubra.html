                <h1>Achillea rubra</h1>
<p>Achillea rubra, commonly known as red yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Red yarrow is known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea rubra has leaves that are basal, with a rosette arrangement, and are gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs, and have a lanceolate shape with serrated edges.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly woody at the base, with a light green to reddish-brown bark. The flowers are white to pink in color, arranged in flat-topped clusters called cymes, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea rubra is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of southern France.</p>
<p>It is also found in North Africa, particularly in regions like Morocco and Algeria. This plant thrives in Mediterranean climates characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is commonly found in rocky soils and open habitats such as coastal areas and scrublands.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea rubra was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive pink flowers and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. Its spread has been particularly notable in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest margins.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its distribution and prevent further ecological impact.</p>
