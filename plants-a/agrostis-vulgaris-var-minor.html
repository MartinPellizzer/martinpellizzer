                    <h1>Agrostis vulgaris var. minor</h1>
<p>Agrostis vulgaris var. minor, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 millimeters wide, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control.</p>
<p>Slender bentgrass is also used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions.</p>
