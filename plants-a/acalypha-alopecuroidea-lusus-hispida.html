                        <h1>Acalypha alopecuroidea lusus hispida</h1>
<p>Acalypha alopecuroidea lusus hispida, commonly known as the roughleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The leaves are typically rough to the touch, with a hairy texture that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha alopecuroidea lusus hispida is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats like forest edges and abandoned fields. It is also known to grow in coastal areas and mangrove swamps in some parts of its range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to human activity, as it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha alopecuroidea lusus hispida was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant has been introduced in several regions, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is often planted along roadsides and in disturbed habitats to prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential requires careful management to avoid ecological disruption.</p>
