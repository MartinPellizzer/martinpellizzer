                <h1>Acer orthocampestre</h1>
<p>Acer orthocampestre, commonly known as the European mountain maple, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in mountainous regions and is characterized by its small, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer orthocampestre has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are alternately arranged on the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, reaching up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, gray-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading habit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated and lack showy petals. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer orthocampestre is a species of maple native to Europe, particularly found in the temperate regions of the western and central parts of the continent.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Britain, France, Germany, and the Iberian Peninsula, though it has become less common in some areas. It thrives in open, sunny environments such as woodlands, grasslands, and heathlands, often growing in well-drained soils. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and changes in land use, Acer orthocampestre is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer orthocampestre is a small, slow-growing ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and compact form.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter offering quicker results. The growth cycle of this tree is relatively slow, with steady development over several years, making it ideal for small spaces.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications in early spring, while pruning is needed to maintain shape and remove dead branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or other aromatic herbs can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
