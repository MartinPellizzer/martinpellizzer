                    <h1>Arum dracunculus</h1>
<p>Arum dracunculus, commonly known as the death cup, is a striking tropical plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a large, umbrella-shaped leaf that can grow up to 3 feet in diameter, with a distinctive purple-tinged stem. The plant produces a spadix, a dense cluster of tiny flowers surrounded by a showy, hood-like spathe. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardens, though it requires specific growing conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>The plant is also notable for its toxic properties, containing calcium oxalate crystals that can cause irritation upon contact.</p>
