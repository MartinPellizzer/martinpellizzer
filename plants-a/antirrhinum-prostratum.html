                    <h1>Antirrhinum prostratum</h1>
<p>Antirrhinum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate snapdragon, is a low-growing flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often lie close to the ground, producing clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, typical of the Plantaginaceae family, and open sequentially along the stem. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated as a ornamental plant for its vibrant blooms and drought tolerance.</p>
