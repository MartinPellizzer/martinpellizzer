                <h1>Aciphyllaea acerosa</h1>
<p>Aciphyllaea acerosa, commonly known as the sharp-leaved aciphyllum, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family. The plant is characterized by its narrow, sharply toothed leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers. It typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Aciphyllaea acerosa is often found in the South Island of New Zealand and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphyllaea acerosa has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elliptical to ovate leaflets that are serrated and have a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green to reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, bloom in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphyllaea acerosa is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the North Island and the South Island, particularly in areas with damp, shaded conditions. This plant typically grows in forest understories and rocky outcrops. It is commonly associated with the lower North Island and parts of the South Island's mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Aciphyllaea acerosa is a relatively rare and specialized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphyllaea acerosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the North Island, particularly in the lower North Island and the Bay of Plenty region. The plant thrives in coastal dunes and sandy soils, often growing in open habitats with full sun exposure. It is considered an exotic species, likely introduced through human activity, possibly as a contaminant in soil or plant material.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has established itself in various ecological zones across its introduced range.</p>
