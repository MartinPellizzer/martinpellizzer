<p>Acetosella vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>tenuifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside, which is due to the presence of anthocyanins.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers during late spring to early summer, which are followed by small, elliptical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and moist meadows.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often used in culinary applications, though it should be consumed in moderation due to its high oxalic acid content.</p>
