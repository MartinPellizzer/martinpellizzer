<p>Asplenium wrightii, commonly known as Wright's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth pattern. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a smooth texture and often features a central vein. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes help it anchor to bark or other substrates.</p>
<p>Wright's spleenwort is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on trees or rocks.</p>
