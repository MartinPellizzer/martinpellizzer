It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in humid forests and shaded areas. The plant is known for its small, delicate flowers and is part of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely tied to the unique ecological conditions of the Brazilian Southeast.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera micrantha was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures, often found in forest understories or near water sources. This plant is commonly seen in Southeast Asia, parts of Africa, and the Caribbean, where it has been introduced as an ornamental or for horticultural purposes.
