                    <h1>Atriplex patula f. erecta</h1>
<p>Atriplex patula f. erecta, commonly known as the upright saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, which distinguishes it from the more sprawling form of the species. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces greenish-yellow flowers in compact clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
