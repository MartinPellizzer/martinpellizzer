<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to salty and windy environments, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it an important pioneer species in stabilizing sandy soils along shorelines.</p>
