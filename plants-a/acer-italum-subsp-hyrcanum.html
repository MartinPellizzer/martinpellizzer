<p>Acer italum subsp.</p>
<p>hyrcanum, commonly known as the Hyrcanian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows to a height of 10–15 meters, featuring a broad, spreading canopy.</p>
<p>The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven pointed lobes, and turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer italum subsp.</p>
<p>hyrcanum has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a medium to large size, dark green on top and lighter green underneath, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its native arid and semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer italum subsp.</p>
<p>hyrcanum is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Caucasus region, specifically found in parts of southern Russia and northern Azerbaijan. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the mountainous areas of the Greater Caucasus.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in temperate climates, typically growing in dry, rocky soils along slopes and in forest edges. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss and climate change, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer italum subsp.</p>
<p>hyrcanum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various environments. It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves rapid growth in the first few years, followed by a slower, more stable development as it matures.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization should be minimal to avoid overgrowth, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and promote health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support beneficial insect life.</p>
