                    <h1>Aloe rupestris</h1>
<p>Aloe rupestris, commonly known as the rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The leaves are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating, and they often bear small, white or yellowish teeth along the edges. It produces yellow flowers in clusters during the rainy season, adding ornamental value to its appearance.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and resilience to harsh conditions.</p>
