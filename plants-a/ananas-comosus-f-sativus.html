                    <h1>Ananas comosus f. sativus</h1>
<p>Ananas comosus f. sativus, commonly known as the cultivated pineapple, is a hybrid form of the pineapple plant, developed for agricultural improvement.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, spiky crown and a fruit that is typically smaller and more elongated than wild varieties. The plant is a tropical perennial, producing a single, fleshy, spiky fruit that is rich in bromelain and other enzymes. Its leaves are long, sword-shaped, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit is typically harvested when the central leaf tips begin to wither, indicating maturity.</p>
