<p>Apodostachys, commonly known as the feather grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Apodostachys species typically produce small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in loose, spike-like clusters. They are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
