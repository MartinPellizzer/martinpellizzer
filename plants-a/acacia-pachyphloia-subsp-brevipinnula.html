<p>Acacia pachyphloia subsp.</p>
<p>brevipinnula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are densely arranged along the stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, typically during the winter months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system and a waxy coating on its leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is an important component of the local flora in its native habitat.</p>
