<p>Agrostis canina subsp.</p>
<p>granatensis, commonly known as the Granatense meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
