                <h1>Absinthium arborescens</h1>
<p>Absinthium arborescens, commonly known as tree wormwood, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a strong, aromatic scent due to its high concentration of volatile oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Its historical use in herbal medicine is linked to its purported digestive and antispasmodic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Absinthium arborescens has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody and cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern with branches extending upward. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Absinthium arborescens is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in its native range, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and human activity. It thrives in dry, rocky environments such as slopes and scrublands, often in well-drained soils. This species is typically found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and declining populations, Absinthium arborescens is considered a species of conservation concern in many regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Absinthium arborescens is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the roots in early spring. The growth cycle of this plant includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
