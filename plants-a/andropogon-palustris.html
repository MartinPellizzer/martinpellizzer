<p>Andropogon palustris, commonly known as sawgrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and distinctive, sharp, serrated edges. Sawgrass thrives in shallow, freshwater wetlands and is often found in marshes and prairies. Its rhizomes allow it to spread and form dense stands, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>The plant plays a vital role in the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems.</p>
