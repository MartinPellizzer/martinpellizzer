<p>Athyrium micropterum, commonly known as the small-crested water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
