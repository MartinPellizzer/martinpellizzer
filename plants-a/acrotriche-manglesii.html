                <h1>Acrotriche manglesii</h1>
<p>Acrotriche manglesii, commonly known as the Mexican sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides habitat for small insects and pollinators.</p>
<p>Acrotriche manglesii is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dryland gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotriche manglesii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche manglesii is primarily native to the island of Hispaniola, which includes the countries of Haiti and the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>It is found in the northern and western regions of the island, particularly in coastal areas and rocky outcrops. This plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to the tropical climate of the region. It is often seen growing in open habitats such as dunes and coastal scrublands.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche manglesii was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or well-drained soils, particularly in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun exposure and moderate to high levels of salinity. This plant is commonly found in dune ecosystems and disturbed coastal habitats. Its introduction has been associated with human activities such as coastal development and land modification.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in most regions where it is found.</p>
