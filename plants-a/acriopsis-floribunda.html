                <h1>Acriopsis floribunda</h1>
<p>Acriopsis floribunda, commonly known as the clustered cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, which are often used in traditional agriculture.</p>
<p>Acriopsis floribunda is valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in sustainable farming practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acriopsis floribunda has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and green in color, growing upright with a branching pattern that becomes more dense toward the top. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in the plant's ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis floribunda is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions across the archipelago, including the islands of Luzon, Mindanao, and Palawan. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical environments, often in forested areas or near water sources. It is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils and thrives in humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a regional endemic species within the Philippines.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis floribunda was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there intentionally for ornamental purposes due to its attractive yellow flowers. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered a potential weed due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
