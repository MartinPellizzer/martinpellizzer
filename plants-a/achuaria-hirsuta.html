                <h1>Achuaria hirsuta</h1>
<p>Achuaria hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy achuaria, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its high-altitude habitat. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Achuaria hirsuta is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achuaria hirsuta has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture, and is typically green to reddish in color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small and clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring a five-petaled structure, with a pale yellow to white color, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achuaria hirsuta is primarily native to the highland regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate to cool climates and is commonly found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. This plant is often associated with rocky or semi-arid environments at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. It is an important species in local ecosystems and has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for various purposes.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the unique environmental conditions of the Andean region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achuaria hirsuta was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and abandoned lands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is often found in temperate climates and has shown adaptability to different environmental conditions. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and reproductive capabilities, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
