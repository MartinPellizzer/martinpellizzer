                    <h1>Alyssum tenium</h1>
<p>Alyssum tenium, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Alyssum tenium thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early autumn.</p>
