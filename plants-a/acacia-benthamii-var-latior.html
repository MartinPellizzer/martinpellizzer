<p>Acacia benthamii var. latior, commonly known as the broad-leafed acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, often fissured, dark grey to black bark and compound leaves composed of multiple pairs of small, narrow, leathery leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are typically clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Acacia benthamii var. latior is often used in revegetation projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils in degraded landscapes.</p>
