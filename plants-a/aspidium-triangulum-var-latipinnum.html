                    <h1>Aspidium triangulum var. latipinnum</h1>
<p>Aspidium triangulum var. latipinnum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern genus Aspidium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically broad and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded gardens.</p>
