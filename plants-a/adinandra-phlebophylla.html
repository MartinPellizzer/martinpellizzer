                <h1>Adinandra phlebophylla</h1>
<p>Adinandra phlebophylla, commonly known as the red-veined evergreen, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves with prominent red veins, giving it its common name. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters.</p>
<p>Adinandra phlebophylla is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra phlebophylla has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra phlebophylla is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>This species thrives in humid, shaded environments within lowland and hill forests. It is commonly found in the understorey layers of these forests, where it benefits from the moist and nutrient-rich soil. The plant is well-adapted to the warm and wet climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic regions due to its particular ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra phlebophylla was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, making it suitable for areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures. This plant is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks, where it can access ample sunlight and moisture. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activity, such as horticultural trade.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains relatively localized compared to other introduced species in these regions.</p>
