                <h1>Adenoncos virens</h1>
<p>Adenoncos virens, commonly known as the green adenoncos, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>Adenoncos virens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soils with partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoncos virens has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that develops vertical ridges as the plant matures, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoncos virens is primarily native to Borneo, Jawa, Malaya, and Sumatera.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of these regions. It thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks or in dense undergrowth. Adenoncos virens is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecosystem of these islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Southeast Asian archipelago.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoncos virens was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, gardens, and urban environments. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate a range of light conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities in certain parts of its range.</p>
