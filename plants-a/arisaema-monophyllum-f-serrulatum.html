<p>Arisaema monophyllum f. serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated leaf arisaema, is a variant of the single-leaf arisaema native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and horticultural collections.</p>
