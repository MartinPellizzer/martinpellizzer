<p>Anychia dichotoma, commonly known as the forked broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing on the roots of grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
