                <h1>Acoridium curranii</h1>
<p>Acoridium curranii, commonly known as the Curran's arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acoraceae family, which includes aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive waxy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-yellow in color, and it produces a unique, spirally arranged fruit.</p>
<p>Acoridium curranii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium curranii has leaves that are sword-shaped, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a rough, bark-like texture that is dark brown in color, and it grows upright from the base. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium curranii is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. This plant is also present in parts of New Guinea and the western Pacific islands. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium curranii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain ecosystems. Its spread has been documented in both coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its population to protect local biodiversity.</p>
