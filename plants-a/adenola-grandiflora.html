                <h1>Adenola grandiflora</h1>
<p>Adenola grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered adenola, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters.</p>
<p>The leaves are ovate with a smooth surface, and the plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenola grandiflora has leaves that are simple, ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenola grandiflora is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest understories and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil. Its distribution is limited to specific ecosystems within these regions.</p>
<p>Adenola grandiflora is not found outside of its native range in Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenola grandiflora was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its striking, large flowers and evergreen foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often cultivated in gardens, public spaces, and as a houseplant because of its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements. It has also been introduced to some parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands as a decorative species.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential in certain environments has raised concerns among ecological conservationists.</p>
