                        <h1>Acaena digitata var. compacta</h1>
<p>Acaena digitata var. compacta, commonly known as the compact thimbleweed, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and features small, spiny leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena digitata var. compacta is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury region. This variety thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland scrub environments.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena digitata var. compacta was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant's rapid spread has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and manage its ecological impact.</p>
