<p>Aconitum fudjisanense, commonly known as the Fujisan Aconite, is a perennial herb native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers are borne on tall, unbranched stems.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum fudjisanense has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a rough texture and a size ranging from 10 to 20 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and cylindrical, with a dark purple to brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are large, showy, and blue to purple in color, arranged in racemes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and deep, adapted for anchoring in rocky or moist mountainous soils.</p>
