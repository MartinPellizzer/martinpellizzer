<p>Adenium swazicum, commonly known as the Swazi adenium, is a striking succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk and smooth, often green or greyish bark. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom at the top of the stem, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Adenium swazicum is adapted to arid environments and is known for its ability to store water in its thick trunk.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenium swazicum has thick, fleshy leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and vary in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and swollen at the base, with a smooth, pale green to greyish bark that becomes rougher with age.

<p>This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often seen growing near rivers or in open grasslands. The species is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in the local ecosystems of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium swazicum was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the eastern regions, as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance.</p>
<p>It has also been introduced to parts of the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it adaptable to various climates. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some areas.</p>
