                <h1>Adhatoda amaranthoides</h1>
<p>Adhatoda amaranthoides, commonly known as the Indian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Adhatoda amaranthoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda amaranthoides has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with pinkish to violet petals, and they bloom during the summer months, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda amaranthoides is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, as well as some regions of Africa. This plant thrives in moist, semi-evergreen forests and along riverbanks, preferring humid and warm climates. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is increasingly threatened by deforestation and land conversion, leading to concerns about its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda amaranthoides is a fast-growing, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions, known for its ornamental value and medicinal uses.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for rapid establishment. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil with moderate to high fertility and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are beneficial, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like basil or marigold can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
