                    <h1>Asystasiella</h1>
<p>Asystasiella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble the shape of a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Asystasiella thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
