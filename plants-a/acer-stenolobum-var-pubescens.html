                <h1>Acer stenolobum var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Acer stenolobum var. pubescens, commonly known as the Florida maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a hairy underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer stenolobum var. pubescens has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a spreading shrub form. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in panicles, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer stenolobum var. pubescens is a variant of the red maple that is native to the southeastern United States, specifically found in parts of Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range due to habitat loss and limited propagation efforts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, often in the understory of mixed hardwood forests. This species typically grows at elevations between 50 and 300 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its limited distribution and habitat specificity make it a species of concern for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer stenolobum var. pubescens is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle involves a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from scale insects or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like clover can improve soil fertility.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer stenolobum var. pubescens is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it an effective stabilizer of slopes and streambanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and supporting microbial activity.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer stenolobum var. pubescens is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in traditional medicine for its leaves and bark, which contain compounds believed to have anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species, contributing to industrial and economic activities through sustainable forestry practices. Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in indigenous communities, representing resilience or natural beauty. While not widely cultivated for commercial purposes, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its unique foliage and autumn coloration.</p>
<p>Its role in maintaining ecological balance and supporting biodiversity makes it an important plant in conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer stenolobum var. pubescens has several popular cultivars, including 'Coral Bark' and 'Autumn Flame', which are prized for their vibrant seasonal color and unique bark texture.</p>
<p>It is also frequently used in hybridization to create new maple varieties with enhanced ornamental traits. Hybrids involving this species often exhibit improved hardiness and broader color variation, making them popular in horticultural gardens. Due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability, it holds significant horticultural importance in landscape design.</p>
<p>Its cultivars and hybrids contribute to the diversity of maple trees available for cultivation in temperate climates.</p>
