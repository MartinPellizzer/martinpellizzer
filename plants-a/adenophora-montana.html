                <h1>Adenophora montana</h1>
<p>Adenophora montana, commonly known as mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands or meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Adenophora montana plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora montana has basal to semi-upright stems that are hairy and range in color from green to reddish-brown, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>Its leaves are lanceolate to ovate, arranged alternately along the stem, and are typically 2-6 inches long with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface. The flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and range in color from white to pale blue, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and anchor itself in moist, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora montana is primarily native to the mountainous regions of western North America, including parts of the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats, particularly in the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada. This plant thrives in rocky soils and open meadows at high elevations. Its distribution extends into areas of British Columbia and Alberta in Canada.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to the cold, dry conditions of its native environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora montana was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight. It has been reported in several states across the northern and central United States.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
