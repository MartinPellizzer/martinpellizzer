<p>Adenophora montana, commonly known as mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands or meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Adenophora montana plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens.</p>
