                    <h1>Aster marginalis</h1>
<p>Aster marginalis, commonly known as the seaside aster, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and maritime environments. The plant produces showy, violet-blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions.</p>
<p>Aster marginalis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for pollinators.</p>
