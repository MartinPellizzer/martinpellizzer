                <h1>Acmella spilanthoides</h1>
<p>Acmella spilanthoides, commonly known as the spiked sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pink petals. The plant produces small, spiky fruits called cypsela, which are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Acmella spilanthoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella spilanthoides has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish with a prominent central disk, arranged in dense inflorescences, and bloom during the dry season, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella spilanthoides is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically found in countries such as Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions of the Atlantic Forest and the Pantanal wetlands, where it thrives in moist, tropical environments. It typically grows in lowland areas with high humidity and partial shade, often near rivers or in swampy soils. The plant is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not officially listed as endangered, its habitat is threatened by deforestation and land conversion, leading to a decline in its natural range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella spilanthoides is a flowering plant commonly grown for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining the desired traits. The plant has a relatively short growth cycle, blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or root rot if care is not taken.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's biodiversity.</p>
