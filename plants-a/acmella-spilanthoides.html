                <h1>Acmella spilanthoides</h1>
<p>Acmella spilanthoides, commonly known as the "spiny false button" or "spiny acmella," is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, spiky, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces a milky, latex-like substance that can cause a tingling or burning sensation upon contact. It is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and chemical properties, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella spilanthoides has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green color and a creeping growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella spilanthoides is primarily native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments within the understory of dense forests. This plant is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with riverbanks and forested wetlands.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of Central America as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella spilanthoides was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its unique and attractive flower structure.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since been found in various regions across the country. Despite its ornamental value, it has shown limited naturalization and does not pose a significant ecological threat. The plant is primarily cultivated in gardens and is not considered invasive in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Its distribution remains localized and controlled, with no widespread establishment in the wild.</p>
