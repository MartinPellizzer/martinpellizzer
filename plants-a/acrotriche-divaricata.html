                <h1>Acrotriche divaricata</h1>
<p>Acrotriche divaricata, commonly known as the variable acrotriche, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotriche divaricata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche divaricata is primarily native to New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal and inland regions of the state. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often seen in open habitats such as heaths and sand dunes. It is a small, herbaceous plant with distinctive hairy leaves.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within New South Wales, reflecting its adaptation to local environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche divaricata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first brought there in the late 19th century by European settlers who admired its foliage and adaptability to different environments. Despite its initial popularity, it has since become a problematic invasive species in some regions of the country. The plant thrives in moist, shady conditions and can spread rapidly in natural ecosystems.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its spread and protect native flora.</p>
