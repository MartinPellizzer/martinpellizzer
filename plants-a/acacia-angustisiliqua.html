                        <h1>Acacia angustisiliqua</h1>
<p>Acacia angustisiliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features slender, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems, and it produces yellow flowers in summer. The plant is adapted to hot, dry climates and has a deep root system to access groundwater. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, which splits open when mature to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Acacia angustisiliqua is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects.</p>
