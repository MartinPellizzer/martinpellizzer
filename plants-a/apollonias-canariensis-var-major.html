<p>Apollonias canariensis var. major, commonly known as the Canary Island date palm, is a striking evergreen tree native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a tall, slender trunk with a distinctive crown of pinnate, feather-like leaves that give it a tropical appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into edible dates, although it is less productive than other date palm varieties. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in the Canary Islands.</p>
