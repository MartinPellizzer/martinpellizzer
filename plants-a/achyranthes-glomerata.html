                <h1>Achyranthes glomerata</h1>
<p>Achyranthes glomerata, commonly known as red root, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces oblong, dark brown seeds that are often dispersed by wind. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which contribute to its common name.</p>
<p>Achyranthes glomerata is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and roadsides.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes glomerata has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5–15 cm long and 2–5 cm wide, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and somewhat woody with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with greenish-white petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes glomerata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant is commonly found in the Indian subcontinent, particularly in states like Assam, West Bengal, and Tamil Nadu. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to humid climates with well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes glomerata was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as agriculture and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in sunny, open areas. This plant has adapted well to various climates and can spread rapidly in the absence of natural predators. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered highly invasive and does not typically outcompete native species.</p>
