                            <h1>Arctium Libanoticum</h1>
<p>Arctium libanoticum is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of western Asia. It is commonly known as the greater burdock and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its most distinctive feature is the burr-like seed heads that cling to clothing and animal fur, aiding in seed dispersal. This resilient plant has been used in traditional medicine and is often found growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
