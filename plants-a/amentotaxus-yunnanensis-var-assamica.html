<p>Amentotaxus yunnanensis var. assamica, commonly known as the Assam fir, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Myanmar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and conical shape, with needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces unique, pendulous cones that are often used in traditional medicine due to their high resin content. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
