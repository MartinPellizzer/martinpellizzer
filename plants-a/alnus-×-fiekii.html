                    <h1>Alnus × fiekii</h1>
<p>Alnus × fiekii, commonly known as the hybrid alder, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Alnus incana (grey alder) and Alnus glutinosa (black alder).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and catkin-like flowers, which are typical of the alder genus. The tree produces small, woody fruits that disperse via wind, aiding in its propagation. Alnus × fiekii is often found in wet or moist soils, thriving in riparian zones and other waterlogged areas.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil and supports surrounding vegetation.</p>
