                <h1>Aeluropus niliacus</h1>
<p>Aeluropus niliacus, commonly known as the coastal grass or sand couch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and is adapted to survive in harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Aeluropus niliacus plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity in coastal and desert ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus niliacus has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically flat, linear, and arranged in two rows along the stem, with a blue-gray coloration that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Its stems are upright, cylindrical, and often have a smooth, slightly hairy texture, with a grayish-green color and a clump-forming growth pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, white to green flowers that bloom in early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight nature.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapted to thrive in arid or saline environments.</p>
