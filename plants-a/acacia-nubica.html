                    <h1>Acacia nubica</h1>
<p>Acacia nubica, commonly known as the Sudanese acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and its yellow, spherical flower heads. The plant produces pods containing seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. Acacia nubica is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it a common component of savanna ecosystems.</p>
<p>It also has cultural and economic significance in some regions, used for fuel, timber, and traditional medicine.</p>
