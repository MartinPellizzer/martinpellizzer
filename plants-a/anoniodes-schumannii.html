                    <h1>Anoniodes schumannii</h1>
<p>Anoniodes schumannii, commonly known as the Schumann's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. This epiphytic plant grows on trees and relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are small, white, and emit a faint fragrance, typically blooming during the dry season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and its elusive nature, it is considered critically endangered and is rarely seen in the wild.</p>
