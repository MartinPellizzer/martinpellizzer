<p>Alisma plantago-aquatica proles graminifolium, commonly known as the slender water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the water's surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often floating on the water. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize the soil and contributes to wetland ecosystem health.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
