                            <h1>Allium Columbianum</h1>
<p>Allium columbianum, commonly known as the Columbia onion, is a hardy perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and a dense bulb that develops at the base. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its fragrant flowers, which bloom in shades of white and pink, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Despite its modest appearance, Allium columbianum plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems and is valued for its ornamental and culinary potential.</p>
