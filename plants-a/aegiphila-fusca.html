                <h1>Aegiphila fusca</h1>
<p>Aegiphila fusca, commonly known as the hairy leaf shrub, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Aegiphila fusca is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila fusca has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or dry soils.</p>
