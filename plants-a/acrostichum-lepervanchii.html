<p>Acrostichum lepervanchii, commonly known as the Lepervanchii fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, compound fronds that are often deeply divided. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and may have a slightly glossy appearance, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens.</p>
