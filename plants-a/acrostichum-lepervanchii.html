                <h1>Acrostichum lepervanchii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum lepervanchii, commonly known as the Lepervanchii fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, compound fronds that are often deeply divided. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and may have a slightly glossy appearance, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lepervanchii has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers with separate male and female parts, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lepervanchii is primarily native to the island of Réunion, located in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is found in the humid tropical environments of this region, particularly in areas with rich, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often near mangroves or in dense vegetation. It is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the warm, moist climate of Réunion.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a regional endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lepervanchii was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it suitable for wetlands and riparian zones. This plant has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and Malaysia, where it has established itself in natural and disturbed habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies in some areas, it remains an important component of the local flora in regions where it is established.</p>
