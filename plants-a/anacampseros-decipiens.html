<p>Anacampseros decipiens, commonly known as the deceitful ice plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid environments.</p>
