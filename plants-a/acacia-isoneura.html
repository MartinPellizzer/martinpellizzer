                    <h1>Acacia isoneura</h1>
<p>Acacia isoneura, commonly known as the mountain acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow to orange spherical flower heads, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Acacia isoneura is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
