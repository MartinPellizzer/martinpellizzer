                    <h1>Anthurium variabile</h1>
<p>Anthurium variabile, commonly known as the variable anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that can range in color from deep green to red or purple. The plant produces striking spathes that enclose its small, spadix-like inflorescence, which is typical of the Araceae family. Anthurium variabile thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation.</p>
