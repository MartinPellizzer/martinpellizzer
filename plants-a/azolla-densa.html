                    <h1>Azolla densa</h1>
<p>Azolla densa, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic fern belonging to the Azollaceae family.</p>
<p>It forms dense mats on the surface of freshwater bodies, contributing to water oxygenation through photosynthesis. The plant has small, overlapping fronds that are rich in nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, enhancing its ecological role in nutrient cycling. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a valuable bioindicator and a potential invasive species in non-native environments.</p>
<p>Azolla densa is also used in traditional agriculture as a biofertilizer due to its high nutrient content.</p>
