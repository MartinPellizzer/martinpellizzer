                        <h1>Acacia sousae</h1>
<p>Acacia sousae, commonly known as the Socotra acacia, is a unique species native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, bottle-shaped stems that store water, an adaptation to the arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments.</p>
<p>Acacia sousae is also notable for its hard, woody pods that contain seeds, contributing to its ecological and botanical significance.</p>
