                <h1>Adinobotrys scandens</h1>
<p>Adinobotrys scandens, commonly known as the climbing hibiscus, is a woody vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, flexible stems that allow it to ascend trees or other structures. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the wet season. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Adinobotrys scandens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinobotrys scandens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern using tendrils. Its small, clustered flowers are white with five petals, bloom during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle containing several small seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinobotrys scandens is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant typically grows as a climbing vine or shrub, often reaching heights of several meters. It thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall.</p>
<p>Adinobotrys scandens is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinobotrys scandens was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found along roadsides, in vacant lots, and in other areas with minimal vegetation competition. This plant has become a significant invasive species in regions where it has been introduced, outcompeting native flora for resources. Its spread is often facilitated by human activities such as construction and land development.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its growth have been challenging due to its resilient nature and prolific seed dispersal.</p>
