<p>Atriplex salicina, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in compact clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its salt tolerance makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing soils in saline areas.</p>
<p>Atriplex salicina also serves as a food source for various wildlife, including birds and insects.</p>
