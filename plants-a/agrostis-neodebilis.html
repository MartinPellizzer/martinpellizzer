                    <h1>Agrostis neodebilis</h1>
<p>Agrostis neodebilis, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as those in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is characterized by its fine texture and ability to thrive in shaded or semi-shaded conditions.</p>
<p>Agrostis neodebilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and use in turfgrass mixes.</p>
