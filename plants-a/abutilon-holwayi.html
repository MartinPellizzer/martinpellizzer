                        <h1>Abutilon holwayi</h1>
<p>Abutilon holwayi, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that give it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems forming a dense, bushy appearance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon holwayi is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Sonora and Sinaloa. This plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, including rocky soils and dry grasslands. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Its native range includes areas with low precipitation and high temperatures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon holwayi was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-modified landscapes, such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and urban environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with warm, dry climates and is commonly found in parts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in some regions where it establishes itself aggressively.</p>
<p>Abutilon holwayi is typically propagated by seed and can spread through both wind and water dispersal.</p>
