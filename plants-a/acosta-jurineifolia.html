                <h1>Acosta jurineifolia</h1>
<p>Acosta jurineifolia, commonly known as the Jurineifolia Acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta jurineifolia has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a deep green color and have a smooth, leathery texture. The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern.</p>
<p>Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta jurineifolia is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude environments, including mountainous areas and cloud forests. This plant thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with rocky or gravelly substrates in these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within the Andes, reflecting its adaptation to the unique environmental conditions of the area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta jurineifolia was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and can tolerate a range of soil types. This plant is commonly found in coastal regions and along roadsides where it can spread rapidly. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native regions, sometimes outcompeting native flora.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it has been introduced.</p>
