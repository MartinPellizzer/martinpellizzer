                    <h1>Antennaria imbricata</h1>
<p>Antennaria imbricata, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It has a mat-forming growth habit with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its adaptations to cold, dry environments include a deep root system and a waxy coating on its leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Antennaria imbricata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitats.</p>
