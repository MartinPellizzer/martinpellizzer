<p>Amyema gibberulosa, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily eucalypts.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves that are usually arranged in pairs along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Amyema gibberulosa is native to southern Australia and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees.</p>
