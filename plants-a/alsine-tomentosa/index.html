                            <h1>Alsine Tomentosa</h1>
<p>Alsine tomentosa, commonly known as hairy alsike, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are tiny, pinkish-white, and clustered in loose inflorescences, making it a subtle yet charming addition to natural landscapes. Despite its modest size, Alsine tomentosa plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland environments.</p>
