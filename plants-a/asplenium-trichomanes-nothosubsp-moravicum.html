<p>Asplenium trichomanes nothosubsp.</p>
<p>moravicum, commonly known as the Moravian rock fern, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Czech Republic. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, compact fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors, where it can anchor itself to limestone or other calcareous substrates. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
