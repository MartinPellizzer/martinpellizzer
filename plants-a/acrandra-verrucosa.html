                <h1>Acrandra verrucosa</h1>
<p>Acrandra verrucosa, commonly known as the rough acanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, spiky bracts that resemble leaves. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface, giving it its common name. It produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow.</p>
<p>Acrandra verrucosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrandra verrucosa has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered in a rough, bark-like texture, with a reddish-brown color. It produces small, clustered flowers with pinkish-white petals, blooming during the summer months, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrandra verrucosa is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland forests and swampy areas where the climate is warm and moist. This plant thrives in environments with high rainfall and rich, well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and is sometimes found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, its distribution is relatively limited to these geographic regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrandra verrucosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its unique and attractive appearance.</p>
<p>It was first brought there in the 19th century by European settlers who were interested in cultivating exotic species. Despite its initial popularity, it has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native flora and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads rapidly through its rhizomes.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is now considered a weed in several parts of New Zealand and requires careful management.</p>
