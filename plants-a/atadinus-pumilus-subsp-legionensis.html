<p>Atadinus pumilus subsp.</p>
<p>legionensis, commonly known as the Legion's dwarf fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, finely divided fronds that typically measure no more than a few centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of its diminutive leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
