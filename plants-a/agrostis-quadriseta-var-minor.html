                    <h1>Agrostis quadriseta var. minor</h1>
<p>Agrostis quadriseta var. minor, commonly known as the lesser bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
