                <h1>Adromischus fragilis</h1>
<p>Adromischus fragilis, commonly known as the brittle ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often tinged with red, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it requires careful handling to prevent damage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adromischus fragilis has fleshy, orbiculate leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in diameter, with a bright green to bluish-green color and a smooth, waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a reddish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly ribbed, growing upright from the base. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and clustered in dense inflorescences, with a pale pink to white color, blooming in spring and summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adromischus fragilis is primarily native to South Africa, specifically the Eastern and Western Cape provinces.</p>
<p>It thrives in the rocky, well-drained soils of these regions. This succulent plant is commonly found in rocky outcrops and granite formations. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is adapted to a Mediterranean climate with dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adromischus fragilis was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique, succulent leaves that resemble miniature cacti. The plant prefers full sun to partial shade and requires minimal watering, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its introduction has been primarily driven by horticultural interest rather than ecological necessity.</p>
<p>However, in some areas, it has shown potential as a pioneer species in degraded landscapes.</p>
