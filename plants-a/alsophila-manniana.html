                    <h1>Alsophila manniana</h1>
<p>Alsophila manniana, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in coastal or mountainous regions. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its growth and contributing to its resilience.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, but in Alsophila manniana, they are more notable for their elegant, arching form.</p>
