<p>Alyssum tortuosum subf.</p>
<p>deminutum, commonly known as the dwarf alpine alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are arranged in a compact rosette, helping it to retain moisture in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
