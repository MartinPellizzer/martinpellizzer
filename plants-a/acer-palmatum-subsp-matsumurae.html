                <h1>Acer palmatum subsp. matsumurae</h1>
<p>Acer palmatum subsp.</p>
<p>matsumurae, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its finely cut, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. It prefers well-drained, acidic soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum subsp.</p>
<p>matsumurae has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a doubly serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length. The leaves are vibrant green during the growing season and turn red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a paired samara with winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum subsp.</p>
<p>matsumurae is a Japanese maple subspecies native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Japan. Its natural habitat includes humid forests and shaded understories in temperate climates.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including North America and Europe. It typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum subsp.</p>
<p>matsumurae is a striking Japanese maple known for its delicate, lace-like foliage and compact growth habit. It can be propagated through semi-hardwood cuttings in late summer or through seeds, though the latter method is slower and less reliable. This species grows best in spring and summer, entering dormancy in winter, and thrives in partial shade with well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Regular watering is essential during the growing season, while fertilization should be minimal to avoid burning its sensitive roots. Pruning is best done in early spring to shape the plant and remove any diseased or damaged branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or hostas can enhance its ornamental appeal while improving soil moisture retention.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum subsp.</p>
<p>matsumurae is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. Its showy spring flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in ornamental gardens, enhancing the aesthetic value of the landscape. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system, which stabilizes soil in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a diverse range of insect life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum subsp.</p>
<p>matsumurae is a decorative plant primarily valued for its ornamental use in horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves have been occasionally used in traditional Japanese tea ceremonies.</p>
<p>In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for its potential antioxidant properties, though scientific evidence remains limited. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in Japanese gardens, representing harmony and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Economically, it contributes to the ornamental plant trade, supporting local nurseries and botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum subsp.</p>
<p>matsumurae has several popular cultivars such as 'Kiyohime' and 'Sekisai', which are prized for their delicate leaf coloration and compact growth. It is also frequently hybridized with other maple species, leading to cultivars like 'Crimson Queen' and 'Emerald Queen' that exhibit enhanced ornamental features.</p>
<p>These hybrids often display improved hardiness and more vibrant foliage, making them popular choices for garden landscapes. The horticultural importance of this species lies in its ability to provide year-round visual interest through its foliage and seasonal color changes.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to various climates further enhances its value in both public and private gardens.</p>
