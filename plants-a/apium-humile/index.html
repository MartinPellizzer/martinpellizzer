                            <h1>Apium Humile</h1>
<p>Field parsley, scientifically known as Apium humile, is a hardy annual herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is often mistaken for common parsley due to its similar appearance but has a distinct, more pungent flavor. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found growing along roadsides and in fields. Its small, fern-like leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb. Despite its modest size, Apium humile plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
