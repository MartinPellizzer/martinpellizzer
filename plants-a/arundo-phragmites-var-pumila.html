                    <h1>Arundo phragmites var. pumila</h1>
<p>Arundo phragmites var. pumila, commonly known as narrowleaf common reed, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and more slender compared to the broader leaves of its parent species, Arundo phragmites. This variety thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, along riverbanks, and in coastal areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
