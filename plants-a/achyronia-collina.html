                <h1>Achyronia collina</h1>
<p>Achyronia collina, commonly known as the small milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies.</p>
<p>Achyronia collina plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia collina has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color that often has a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, semi-woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows in a spreading pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia collina is primarily native to the eastern United States, including states such as North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetland areas. This plant is commonly found in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont regions of the southeastern U.S. It is also present in parts of eastern Texas and western Florida.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the southeastern portion of the North American continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia collina was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and well-drained soil. This plant has been reported in several states across the eastern United States, including Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Its introduction is often associated with human activity, such as land development and transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in local ecosystems.</p>
