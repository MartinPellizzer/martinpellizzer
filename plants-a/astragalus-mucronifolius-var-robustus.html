<p>Astragalus mucronifolius var. robustus, commonly known as the robust milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This species is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats, contributing to soil stabilization and forage for wildlife.</p>
