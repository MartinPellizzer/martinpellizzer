                <h1>Acosta spinosa</h1>
<p>Acosta spinosa, commonly known as the spiny acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible roots. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with branched stems covered in stiff, spiny hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are typically greenish-white in color, and it produces small, round berries that are edible.</p>
<p>Acosta spinosa thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta spinosa has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with rough, spiny hairs, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with five pale yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta spinosa is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, including parts of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, typically at elevations between 2,500 and 4,500 meters. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or mountainous terrain. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various local wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is not commonly found outside of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta spinosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in the Andean regions of South America, including Ecuador, Peru, and northern Chile. It has been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction is often associated with human activity, such as agriculture and land development.</p>
