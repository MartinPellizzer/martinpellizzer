                    <h1>Agrostis aristulata</h1>
<p>Agrostis aristulata, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Agrostis aristulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
