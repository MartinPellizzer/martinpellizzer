                <h1>Achyranthes obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Achyranthes obtusifolia, commonly known as broadleaf hogweed, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its root system is thick and fleshy, and the plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils.</p>

<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose spikes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its tiny seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensively branched, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>
