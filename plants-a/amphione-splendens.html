                    <h1>Amphione splendens</h1>
<p>Amphione splendens, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange floral bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers but are actually modified leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical collections.</p>
<p>Amphione splendens is also noted for its ability to climb using aerial roots, adapting to its natural habitat in forest canopies.</p>
