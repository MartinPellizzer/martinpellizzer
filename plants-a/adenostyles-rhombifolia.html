                <h1>Adenostyles rhombifolia</h1>
<p>Adenostyles rhombifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its rhomboid-shaped leaves and showy pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to dry, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Adenostyles rhombifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles rhombifolia has leaves that are rhombic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical dispersal when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles rhombifolia is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly Spain and southern France.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands, where it thrives in rocky and limestone-rich environments. It typically grows in open woodlands, scrublands, and along rocky outcrops at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its natural habitat and ensure its survival in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenostyles rhombifolia is a hardy, evergreen shrub known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in mild climates and reaching maturity over several years.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications in spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with aromatic herbs like rosemary or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the gardenâ€™s biodiversity.</p>
