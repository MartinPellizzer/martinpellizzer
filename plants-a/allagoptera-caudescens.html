                    <h1>Allagoptera caudescens</h1>
<p>Allagoptera caudescens, commonly known as the long-stalked mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white or pale green flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. It is native to regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Peru.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
