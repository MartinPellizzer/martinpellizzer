<p>Aconitum liangshanicum, commonly known as the Liangshan aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province in China, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are deeply lobed and can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Like other members of the aconite genus, it contains toxic alkaloids, making it both a hazardous and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum liangshanicum has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are blue to purple, arranged in racemes, with showy petals and a spurred structure, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects.
