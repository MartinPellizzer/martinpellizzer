                <h1>Acrostichum gayanum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum gayanum, commonly known as the Sri Lankan tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Sri Lanka and parts of India.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with the trunk elongating over time while the fronds grow from the top. Its fronds are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Acrostichum gayanum plays a role in tropical ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum gayanum has long, pinnately compound leaves that are broad and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a deep green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the rainy season, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a three-lobed, spiky capsule that disperses seeds through wind and water.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it spread and anchor in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum gayanum is a rare fern native to the island of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is currently found only in specific regions of the country, particularly in the wet zone. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is listed as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acrostichum gayanum is a hardy fern that thrives in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through spores or by dividing the rhizomes, which is most effective in early spring. The growth cycle of this plant is slow, with new fronds emerging gradually throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining, rich soil and requires consistent watering to maintain moisture without becoming waterlogged. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning of old fronds encourages new development.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract slugs or snails, making companion planting with aromatic herbs like mint or rosemary beneficial for natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acrostichum gayanum is a wetland plant that provides essential habitat and food for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a natural buffer, helping to control erosion along water bodies. Its dense growth also offers shelter to small vertebrates and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving water quality by filtering sediments and pollutants.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acrostichum gayanum is a versatile plant with various uses and applications.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, its leaves are used as a vegetable in traditional dishes, adding a unique flavor. Medicinally, it has been utilized in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, including anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, the plant contributes to local economies through sustainable harvesting and processing.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain communities, representing resilience and natural heritage.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acrostichum gayanum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are of interest in horticulture.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegatum' and 'Pictum', which are known for their striking leaf patterns and coloration. Hybrids of Acrostichum gayanum are often created to enhance ornamental traits such as leaf color, size, and texture. These plants are valued for their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Their horticultural importance lies in their use as decorative foliage plants in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
