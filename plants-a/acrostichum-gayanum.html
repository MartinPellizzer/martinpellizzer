                <h1>Acrostichum gayanum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum gayanum, commonly known as the Sri Lankan fern, is a species of tree fern native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant features large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bright green and contribute to the plant's ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum gayanum has long, strap-like leaves that are usually narrow and linear, arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically greenish in color, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds through wind, with the seeds being small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum gayanum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. This plant thrives in humid and warm climates with high moisture levels. Its natural habitat includes mangrove forests and coastal areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Acrostichum gayanum is also occasionally cultivated in ornamental gardens in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum gayanum was mainly introduced to the wetlands and riparian zones of tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and abundant water sources. This plant is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, including Sri Lanka and India.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
