                <h1>Acnistus insularis</h1>
<p>Acnistus insularis, commonly known as the island acnistus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific islands.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture.</p>
<p>Acnistus insularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in tropical regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus insularis has simple, ovate leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in axillary inflorescences, bloom during the spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring in coastal or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus insularis is primarily native to the Philippines, specifically found on several islands in the archipelago.</p>
<p>This species is commonly associated with coastal and lowland habitats, often growing in disturbed or open areas. It is particularly prevalent on the islands of Luzon, Mindanao, and Samar. The plant is adapted to the tropical climate of these regions, thriving in warm and humid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a regionally important species within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus insularis was mainly introduced to Hawaii through human activity, likely as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in various coastal and disturbed areas throughout the state. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is commonly found in lowland habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
