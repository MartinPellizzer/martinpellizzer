                    <h1>Acrorchis roseola</h1>
<p>Acrorchis roseola, commonly known as the rose-colored twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Acrorchis roseola is noted for its ephemeral blooming period, often flowering in early spring before the canopy of the forest fully develops.</p>
