                <h1>Acrorchis roseola</h1>
<p>Acrorchis roseola, commonly known as the rose-colored twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Acrorchis roseola is noted for its ephemeral blooming period, often flowering in early spring before the canopy of the forest fully develops.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrorchis roseola has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branched. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring a pale pink to white color, blooming in early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animal carriers.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrorchis roseola is primarily native to Costa Rica and Panam√°.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical regions of these Central American countries. It typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant is adapted to the specific climate and soil conditions of these areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these two nations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrorchis roseola was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It has been observed in states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its introduction is likely due to human activity, including the transportation of soil or plant material.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
