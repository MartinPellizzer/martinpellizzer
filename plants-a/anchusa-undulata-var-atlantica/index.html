                            <h1>Anchusa Undulata Var. Atlantica</h1>
<p>Blueweed, scientifically known as Anchusa undulata var. atlantica, is a strikingly blue flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is prized for its vibrant, sky-blue blooms that appear in late spring and early summer. This variety of Anchusa is characterized by its compact growth habit and broad, wavy leaves. Its ability to thrive in well-drained soils makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Despite its beauty, Blueweed requires full sun and is relatively low maintenance once established.</p>
