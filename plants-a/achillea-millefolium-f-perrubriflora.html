                <h1>Achillea millefolium f. perrubriflora</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. perrubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered yarrow, is a botanical variant of the common yarrow.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red-tinged flower heads, which contrast with the typical white or yellow of the species. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves and is often found in meadows and open woodlands. It is a perennial herb with a long flowering period, typically from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in gardens for its vibrant color and hardy nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. perrubriflora has finely divided, feathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by red or orange ray flowers, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, dispersing by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing for vegetative propagation.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. perrubriflora is a variant of the common yarrow, native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Central and Eastern Europe, where it has been introduced and occasionally naturalized. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes, often in well-drained soils. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species with a conservation status of least concern, though it requires protection from habitat degradation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. perrubriflora is a vibrant perennial plant known for its showy red flowers and feathery foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, going through a period of active growth in spring and flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, but it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and encourage reblooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. perrubriflora is a flowering plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its bright yellow flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its beneficial properties.
