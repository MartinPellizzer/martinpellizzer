                    <h1>Ariocarpus fissuratus var. lloydii</h1>
<p>Ariocarpus fissuratus var. lloydii, commonly known as the "Lloyd's fissured liverwort," is a rare and unique member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, segmented stems that resemble a liver, hence its common name. The plant is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in the spring, and it produces small, red, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
