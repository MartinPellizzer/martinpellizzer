<p>Arenaria montana subsp.</p>
<p>linearifolia, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically features a mat-forming growth habit with small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ability to colonize harsh habitats, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
