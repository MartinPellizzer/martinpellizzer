                <h1>Adiantum duale</h1>
<p>Adiantum duale, commonly known as the twin fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and finely divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum duale is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum duale has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with slender, linear leaflets arranged along a central rachis.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they are borne on upright, slender stems that have a smooth, pale green bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, with a simple structure and yellowish-green color, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, dry seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and spread horizontally near the soil surface, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum duale is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, India, and parts of Southeast Asian islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in moist, shaded environments like forests and mountainous areas. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often associated with rocky or wooded habitats. Its distribution spans across various regions in Asia where the climate supports its growth.</p>
<p>It is a hardy species that can adapt to different soil types as long as the conditions remain consistently damp.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum duale was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. This fern is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value due to its delicate, lace-like fronds. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
