                    <h1>Acaena argentea var. longifolia</h1>
<p>Acaena argentea var. longifolia, commonly known as silver weed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range.</p>
