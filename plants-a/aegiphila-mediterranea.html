                <h1>Aegiphila mediterranea</h1>
<p>Aegiphila mediterranea, commonly known as Mediterranean aegiphila, is a small shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and coastal areas, exhibiting a compact growth habit with dense foliage. The plant has aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in shades of pink or purple, blooming in the spring.</p>
<p>Aegiphila mediterranea is adapted to tolerate drought and salt spray, making it a hardy species in Mediterranean climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila mediterranea has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, woody, and has a light brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white or pale pink petals, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soil.</p>
