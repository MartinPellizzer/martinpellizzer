<p>Angelica acutiloba f. tsukubana, commonly known as the Tsukubana angelica, is a rare and distinctive variant of the angelica plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional Japanese medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
