<p>Amphipappus, commonly known as the "false dandelion," is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which consist of numerous small florets arranged in a single, showy inflorescence. The leaves are typically alternate, oblanceolate, and often have a hairy or glandular surface. Amphipappus species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>They are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments.</p>
