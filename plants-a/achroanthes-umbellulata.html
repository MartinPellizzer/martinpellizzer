                <h1>Achroanthes umbellulata</h1>
<p>Achroanthes umbellulata, commonly known as the yellow sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clustered umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is well adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achroanthes umbellulata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbellate inflorescences, blooming during the spring months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achroanthes umbellulata is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky habitats and open areas within these regions. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often associated with chaparral and sagebrush ecosystems. Its distribution is limited to specific areas where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.</p>
<p>It is not found outside of these geographic ranges in the wild.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achroanthes umbellulata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, particularly on sandy and gravelly soils. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained environments and is often seen along the shores of bays and estuaries. It has become naturalized in several regions, contributing to the local flora.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its preference for specific habitat conditions.</p>
