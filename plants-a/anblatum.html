                    <h1>Anblatum</h1>
<p>Anblatum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and livestock, are an important food source for certain bird species.</p>
<p>Anblatum is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
