<p>Anthericum inconspicuum, commonly known as the lesser nettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the wetlands and marshes of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are often inconspicuous and lack showy petals. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Anthericum inconspicuum plays a role in supporting local insect populations, particularly as a food source for certain pollinators.</p>
