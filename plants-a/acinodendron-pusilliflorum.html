                <h1>Acinodendron pusilliflorum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron pusilliflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered acinodendron, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2â€“5 meters. The plant features opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, spherical berries that are typically red when mature.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pusilliflorum has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a light gray bark that is smooth when young and develops shallow fissures with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pusilliflorum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a regionally rare plant.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pusilliflorum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. This plant has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
