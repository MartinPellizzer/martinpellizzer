<p>Antirrhinum majus subsp.</p>
<p>diminutum, commonly known as the dwarf snapdragon, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features vibrant, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, yellow, and orange, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and grows to a height of only a few inches, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and it is often used in garden settings for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to the common snapdragon but is distinguished by its smaller size and unique floral characteristics.</p>
