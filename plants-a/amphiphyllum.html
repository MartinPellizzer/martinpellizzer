                    <h1>Amphiphyllum</h1>
<p>Amphiphyllum, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic plant found in shallow, freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It has floating leaves that are oval-shaped with a waxy surface, allowing them to remain buoyant. The plant's roots are submerged, anchoring it to the bottom of ponds or lakes. Amphiphyllum produces small, green flowers that are often submerged or just below the water's surface.</p>
<p>Its unique structure allows it to thrive in wetlands and contribute to aquatic ecosystems.</p>
