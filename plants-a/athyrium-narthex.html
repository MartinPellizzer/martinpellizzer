<p>Athyrium narthex, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese shield fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy sheen. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the ground.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
