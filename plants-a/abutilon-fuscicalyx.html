<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their primitive features and vascular systems. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological adaptations.</p>
<p>Its order is Malvales, which consists of flowering plants that often have showy flowers and include many species used in horticulture. Its family is Malvaceae, commonly known as the mallow family, which includes plants with distinctive flowers and some that produce cotton or other fibrous materials. Its genus is Abutilon, a group of flowering plants commonly known as the "velvetleaf" or "Chinese lantern" plants, characterized by their fuzzy leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Abutilon fuscicalyx, a specific type of plant within the genus Abutilon, known for its unique morphological traits and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon fuscicalyx is primarily native to Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the eastern regions of the country, particularly in the Amazonian lowlands. This plant thrives in humid, tropical environments with rich, well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific areas within Bolivia, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon fuscicalyx was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>
