                <h1>Achyrophorus sellowii</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus sellowii, commonly known as the Sellow's achyrophorus, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus sellowii has palmate leaves that are typically 10-20 cm in diameter, with five to seven lobes, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green, smooth on the upper surface, and slightly hairy on the underside. The stem is cylindrical, slender, and slightly woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, relying on wind pollination for reproduction.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus sellowii is primarily native to southern Brazil, particularly the state of Paran√°, and parts of northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands and open areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with disturbed habitats. It is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is a member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus sellowii was mainly introduced to the Americas through human activity, particularly during the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and waste places. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and climatic conditions, contributing to its widespread distribution. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>However, it is generally not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
