                <h1>Adyseton petalodes</h1>
<p>Adyseton petalodes, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and can spread widely, making it a persistent weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils contribute to its invasive potential in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adyseton petalodes has leaves that are simple, ovate in shape, with a smooth margin, and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length, and have a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, light brown bark, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern, often twining around supports. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
