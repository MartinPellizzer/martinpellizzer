                <h1>Achras meridionalis</h1>
<p>Achras meridionalis, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its thick, buttressed roots and broad, leathery leaves. The plant produces a fruit that is botanically classified as a syncarp, formed from the fusion of multiple berries. The fruit is rich in carbohydrates and has been a vital food source for indigenous communities.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras meridionalis has large, palmate leaves that are typically lobed, with a broad, green color and a waxy texture, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is thick, fleshy, and often swollen, with a smooth, pale green or grayish bark that has a distinctive, almost woody texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white or pale yellow petals, and they bloom during the dry season, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a large, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, containing numerous seeds dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant and helping it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras meridionalis is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically the eastern and southern regions of the continent.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as South Africa, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and near riverbanks. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in coastal vegetation.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends from the coastal regions of KwaZulu-Natal to the eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras meridionalis was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique fruit.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its decorative value and potential economic use. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists regarding its ecological impact.</p>
<p>However, it remains a popular choice for horticultural purposes in regions with suitable climates.</p>
