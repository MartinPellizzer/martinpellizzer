                    <h1>Avicennia tomentosa var. australasica</h1>
<p>Avicennia tomentosa var. australasica, commonly known as the coastal mangrove or broad-leaved mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in coastal conditions. The plant has a unique ability to excrete excess salt through specialized glands on its leaves. It typically grows in intertidal zones, forming dense forests that stabilize shorelines.</p>
<p>Its pneumatophores, or breathing roots, allow it to absorb oxygen from waterlogged soil.</p>
