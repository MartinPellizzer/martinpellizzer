                <h1>Acrocentron ornatum</h1>
<p>Acrocentron ornatum, commonly known as the ornate acrocentron, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, ornate inflorescence that consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its leaves are typically broad and arrow-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>Acrocentron ornatum is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in ornamental gardens and water features.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocentron ornatum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocentron ornatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forest environments, often found in the understory of evergreen and semi-deciduous forests. This plant is commonly associated with areas that have rich organic soil and high rainfall throughout the year. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a species of conservation concern in some parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocentron ornatum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures, making it common in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is often found growing near streams or in dense undergrowth where it can receive adequate light without direct sun exposure. Its introduction has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common ornamental plant in horticulture.</p>
