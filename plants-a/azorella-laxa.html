                    <h1>Azorella laxa</h1>
<p>Azorella laxa, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the high Andes of South America, where it thrives in cold, arid environments. The plant forms dense, low-growing cushions made up of tightly packed stems and leaves. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Azorella laxa produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to its rocky habitat.</p>
