<p>Abies conica is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic value and resilience.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies conica is primarily native to the mountainous regions of western North America, including parts of the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Pacific Northwest, particularly in Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia. This species thrives in cool, moist environments at high elevations, often in coniferous forests. It is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a characteristic plant of subalpine and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends from the Sierra Nevada to the Cascade Range and into the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies conica was mainly introduced to specific regions in the northern hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It was introduced primarily for ornamental purposes due to its unique conical shape and evergreen foliage.
