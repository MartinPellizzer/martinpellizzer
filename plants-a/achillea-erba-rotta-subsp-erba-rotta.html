<p>Achillea erba-rotta subsp.</p>
<p>erba-rotta, commonly known as the common yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust root system and upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, flat-topped flower heads, typically in shades of white, pink, or pale yellow, from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common sight in meadows and dry grasslands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>

<p>The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta subsp.</p>
<p>erba-rotta is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa. Its current distribution includes areas such as Italy, Spain, and Morocco, where it thrives in dry, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>It prefers rocky soils and open landscapes, often growing in grasslands and along coastal areas. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>It is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not currently at risk of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
