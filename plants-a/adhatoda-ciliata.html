<p>Adhatoda ciliata, commonly known as the Indian Trumpet or Kachnar, is a deciduous shrub native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adhatoda ciliata is valued for its ornamental beauty and traditional medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda ciliata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm in length and have serrated margins. The stem is cylindrical, woody, and has a rough, greyish-brown bark that peels off in thin flakes. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, and have a pale blue to white color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda ciliata is a flowering plant native to tropical and southern Africa, particularly found in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is now also distributed in parts of India and Southeast Asia, where it has been introduced for ornamental or medicinal purposes. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forest edges, riverbanks, and disturbed areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat faces threats from deforestation and land use changes, leading to a decline in its population in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda ciliata is a hardy, fast-growing plant commonly used in traditional medicine and ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>
