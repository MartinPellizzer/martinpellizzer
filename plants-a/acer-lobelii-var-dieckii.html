                    <h1>Acer lobelii var. dieckii</h1>
<p>Acer lobelii var. dieckii, commonly known as the Dieck's maple, is a rare and delicate deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high elevations of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
