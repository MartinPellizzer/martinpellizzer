<p>It features narrow, upright leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers on tall, branching inflorescences during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Aloe sororia is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal.</p>
