                <h1>Acrotriche prostrata</h1>
<p>Acrotriche prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate acrotriche, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and sometimes reduced to scales, adapting to minimize water evaporation.</p>
<p>Acrotriche prostrata is well-suited for xerophytic gardens and requires minimal water once established.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotriche prostrata has prostrate growth habit with spreading stems that often root at the nodes.</p>
<p>Its leaves are linear to oblanceolate, arranged in a whorled pattern, and range from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a bluish-gray color due to dense pubescence. The stem is cylindrical, covered with short, stiff hairs, and has a grayish-green color, growing along the ground. The flowers are small, greenish-white, clustered in terminal racemes, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche prostrata is primarily native to Victoria.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of Victoria, Australia. This plant typically grows in sandy soils along the shorelines. It is adapted to the harsh conditions of the coastal environment.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Victoria due to its particular habitat requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche prostrata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, low-growing appearance.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to establish in disturbed soils. The plant thrives in coastal and lowland environments, often colonizing open areas with poor soil quality.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to outcompete native flora.</p>
