                    <h1>Acrotriche prostrata</h1>
<p>Acrotriche prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate acrotriche, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and sometimes reduced to scales, adapting to minimize water evaporation.</p>
<p>Acrotriche prostrata is well-suited for xerophytic gardens and requires minimal water once established.</p>
