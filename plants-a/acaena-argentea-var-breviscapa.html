                        <h1>Acaena argentea var. breviscapa</h1>
<p>Acaena argentea var. breviscapa, commonly known as silver burr or silver weed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers followed by spiny, spherical fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in areas outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena argentea var. breviscapa is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as tussock grasslands and rocky areas. It is adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of these regions.</p>
<p>The species is part of the native flora that has evolved in isolation on the island.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena argentea var. breviscapa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver foliage. The plant has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites, often forming dense mats.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly.</p>
