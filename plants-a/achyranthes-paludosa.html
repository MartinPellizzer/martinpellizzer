<p>Achyranthes paludosa, commonly known as swamp knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, often forming dense colonies. The plant has slender, erect stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes, and it produces small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Achyranthes paludosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
