                <h1>Adesmia pentaphylla</h1>
<p>Adesmia pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leafed legume, is a flowering plant species native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring compound leaves with five leaflets. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to purple.</p>
<p>Adesmia pentaphylla is valued for its ecological role in soil enrichment and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia pentaphylla has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring between 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and they grow in a sprawling or ascending pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia pentaphylla is primarily native to Argentina Northwest and Chile Central.</p>
<p>This species is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these areas. It thrives in rocky soils and open habitats. The plant is adapted to the dry climate of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia pentaphylla was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and areas with disturbed vegetation, often thriving in urban and agricultural settings. The plant's ability to adapt to various soil types and its rapid growth rate contribute to its successful establishment. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature and potential to outcompete native flora.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded significantly in areas with moderate climates and sufficient sunlight.</p>
