                    <h1>Ajuga decumbens var. oblancifolia</h1>
<p>Ajuga decumbens var. oblancifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with oval, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick ground cover, making it a valuable plant for erosion control.</p>
