<p>Almeidea longipes, commonly known as the long-footed almeidea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and prefers cool, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Almeidea longipes is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
