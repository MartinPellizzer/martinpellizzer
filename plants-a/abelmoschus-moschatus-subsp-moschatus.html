<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus moschatus subsp.</p>
<p>moschatus is a heat-loving plant commonly known as the okra, prized for its edible pods. It can be propagated through seeds, which should be sown directly into warm soil after the last frost.</p>
<p>The growth cycle of okra includes a rapid germination period, followed by rapid vegetative growth and flowering, with pods developing within 40 to 60 days. It thrives in well-drained soil with full sun and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Regular fertilization with a balanced fertilizer and pruning of old leaves can promote better yields, while common pests like aphids and diseases such as powdery mildew should be monitored.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>
