                    <h1>Arceuthobium laricis</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium laricis, commonly known as the larch dodder, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of larch trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is often found in coniferous forests. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, which can lead to reduced growth and vigor in the larch trees.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized nature, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
