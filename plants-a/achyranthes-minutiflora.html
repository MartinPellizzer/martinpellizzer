                <h1>Achyranthes minutiflora</h1>
<p>Achyranthes minutiflora, commonly known as small-flowered cowhage, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring upright stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and have a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several elliptical seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes minutiflora has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense spikes, with pale green to white petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes minutiflora is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of southern Arabia and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other regions where it can establish itself in similar ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes minutiflora was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in roadsides, waste areas, and along railway tracks. The plant has a spreading growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions but has been introduced to various parts of the world.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some ecosystems.</p>
