                <h1>Aegiphila uasadiana</h1>
<p>Aegiphila uasadiana, commonly known as the Uasadi sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a valued species in both horticulture and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila uasadiana has leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often branching, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
