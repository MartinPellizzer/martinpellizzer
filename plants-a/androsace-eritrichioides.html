                    <h1>Androsace eritrichioides</h1>
<p>Androsace eritrichioides, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, usually blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows and tundra environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions.</p>
