                    <h1>Agrostis stolonifera var. laevigata</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonifera var. laevigata, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features fine, soft, bluish-green leaves that are covered with fine hairs, giving it a silky texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters along its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats, making it a common weed in turfgrass settings.</p>
