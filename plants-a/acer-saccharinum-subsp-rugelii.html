                <h1>Acer saccharinum subsp. rugelii</h1>
<p>Acer saccharinum subsp.</p>
<p>rugelii, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>The tree has a broad, spreading crown and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer saccharinum subsp.</p>
<p>rugelii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils in which this species typically grows.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer saccharinum subsp.</p>
<p>rugelii is a rare variant of the silver maple, native to the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in Tennessee and North Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones. This subspecies typically grows at elevations between 300 and 900 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer saccharinum subsp.</p>
<p>rugelii is a slow-growing, ornamental tree known for its striking red autumn foliage. It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The tree has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. Common pests include aphids and scale, while diseases like verticillium wilt can affect it, though it is generally resistant to many common issues.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer saccharinum subsp.</p>
<p>rugelii is a hardy, deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, spring blooms.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting a wide range of insect life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer saccharinum subsp.</p>
<p>rugelii is a lesser-known variant of the silver maple, primarily valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and soil stabilization. While not commonly used in culinary applications, its sap can be processed similarly to other maple species, though it is less sweet and less commercially viable.</p>
<p>In medicinal contexts, it has been traditionally used in some indigenous practices for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to the timber industry, providing wood for construction and furniture, though its economic importance is limited compared to other maple species.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic value in regions where it is native, representing resilience and adaptability in natural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer saccharinum subsp.</p>
<p>rugelii has several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson King' and 'Orange Queen', which are prized for their vibrant autumn color and compact growth. It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, leading to cultivars like 'Autumnalis' and 'Crimson Sentinel' that exhibit enhanced ornamental traits.</p>
<p>These hybrids often display improved cold hardiness and more intense fall foliage compared to the species itself. Due to its striking appearance, it holds significant horticultural importance in ornamental gardening and landscape design.</p>
<p>Its versatility and visual appeal make it a favored choice for urban and residential landscapes.</p>
