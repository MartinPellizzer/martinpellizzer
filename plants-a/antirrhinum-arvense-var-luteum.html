                    <h1>Antirrhinum arvense var. luteum</h1>
<p>Antirrhinum arvense var. luteum, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its role in supporting pollinators.</p>
