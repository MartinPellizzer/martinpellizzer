                <h1>Adenocarpus commutatus</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus commutatus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain seeds with tufted hairs for wind dispersal. It is often found in grassland and woodland habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its latex sap is milky and can cause skin irritation, which is a notable botanical feature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus commutatus has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy lower surface, varying in size from 3 to 10 cm in length, and typically have a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a rough, reddish-brown bark, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in the plant's ability to absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus commutatus is primarily native to Algeria and Sicily.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the Mediterranean region, particularly in these two locations. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is commonly seen in coastal and mountainous areas. Adenocarpus commutatus is known for its small, yellow flowers and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific regions, making it a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus commutatus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in regions with moderate rainfall. This plant is often considered an invasive species in some parts of the world due to its rapid growth and competitive nature. It can spread through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, water, and animals.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities in certain ecosystems.</p>
