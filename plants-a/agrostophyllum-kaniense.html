                    <h1>Agrostophyllum kaniense</h1>
<p>Agrostophyllum kaniense, commonly known as the Kaniense mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Ficus*, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its environment.</p>
