<p>Arctostaphylos cushingiana f. repens, commonly known as the creeping manzanita, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It features dense, prostrate stems that form a mat-like structure, often carpeting the ground with a thick layer of foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing year-round coverage and contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
