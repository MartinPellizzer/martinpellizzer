                    <h1>Ateramnus glandulosus</h1>
<p>Ateramnus glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety thallus covered with small, glandular dots that produce a sticky substance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its nutritional needs. It is often found on bark, soil, or rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and chemical composition make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies.</p>
