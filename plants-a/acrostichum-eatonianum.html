                <h1>Acrostichum eatonianum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum eatonianum, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a unique reproductive system, with spores produced on the underside of its fronds. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and enabling it to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Acrostichum eatonianum plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's forests, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum eatonianum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically broad and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and can reach up to 2 meters in length, with a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a climbing or creeping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, with a greenish-white color, blooming during the rainy season, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind after drying.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the plant in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum eatonianum is primarily native to the coastal regions of southeastern Brazil, particularly in the states of Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and salt marshes. This plant is well adapted to saline environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. It is also occasionally found in adjacent freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum eatonianum was mainly introduced to the southern coastal regions of Florida and the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It was primarily brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, large, and glossy fronds. This plant thrives in moist, humid environments and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and marshes. Its introduction has led to its establishment in wetland areas, sometimes competing with native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in the regions where it has been introduced.</p>
