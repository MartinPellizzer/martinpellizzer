                <h1>Acer spicatum f. rugosum</h1>
<p>Acer spicatum f. rugosum, commonly known as the roughleaf maple, is a variant of the red maple species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves that are usually dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer spicatum f. rugosum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer spicatum f. rugosum is a rare variant of the mountain maple, native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific regions in Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in coniferous or mixed forests. This plant is typically found at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of concern and is often protected in conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer spicatum f. rugosum is a compact, ornamental maple known for its distinctive, finely toothed foliage and vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-hardwood cuttings in late summer or by seeds collected in the fall, which require cold stratification for germination. This plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soil and should be watered regularly during dry periods without becoming waterlogged. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the plant and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials like heuchera or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a shaded garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer spicatum f. rugosum is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer spicatum f. rugosum is a variant of the mountain maple known for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>While not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal practices, it has been used by indigenous communities for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and is valued in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in regional folklore and is often featured in local art and literature.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer spicatum f. rugosum has several popular cultivars that are prized for their unique foliage and ornamental value, such as 'Crimson King' and 'Variegatum'.</p>
<p>These cultivars are often selected for their striking coloration and compact growth habit. Hybrids involving Acer spicatum f. rugosum are less common but can be found in specialized collections, often combining traits from related maple species. The plant holds horticultural importance as a hardy, shade-tolerant species suitable for small gardens and woodland landscapes.</p>
<p>Its variegated leaves make it a valuable addition to the palette of ornamental maples.</p>
