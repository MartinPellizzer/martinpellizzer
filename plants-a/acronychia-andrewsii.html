                <h1>Acronychia andrewsii</h1>
<p>Acronychia andrewsii, commonly known as the Australian holly, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and smooth, grey bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rainforest areas.</p>
<p>Acronychia andrewsii is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia andrewsii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that peels off in thin layers as the plant matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, round drupe that splits open to release smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, helping it thrive in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia andrewsii is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically the coastal regions of New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in subtropical and tropical rainforests, growing in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, often along riverbanks and in coastal scrublands. Acronychia andrewsii is known for its distinctive elliptical leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia andrewsii was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments where it can receive ample sunlight. The plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and along riverbanks, making it adaptable to various ecological niches. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of Southeast Asia and parts of Australia.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native flora.</p>
