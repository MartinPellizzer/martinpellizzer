<p>Asplenium × reuteri nothosubsp.</p>
<p>reuteri, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium scolopendrium. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with a distinctive, shield-like appearance.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a natural hybrid in the Aspleniaceae family.</p>
