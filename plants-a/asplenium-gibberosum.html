                    <h1>Asplenium gibberosum</h1>
<p>Asplenium gibberosum, commonly known as the hairy spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant's sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. It is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is a relatively uncommon and specialized species within the Asplenium genus.</p>
