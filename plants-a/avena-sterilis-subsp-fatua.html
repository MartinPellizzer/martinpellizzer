<p>Avena sterilis subsp.</p>
<p>fatua, commonly known as wild oat, is a grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, awned spikelets that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and agricultural areas, and is often considered a weed. Its rapid growth and ability to produce a large number of seeds contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is distinguished by its hollow stems, leathery leaves, and the presence of a distinct lemma and palea in its florets.</p>
