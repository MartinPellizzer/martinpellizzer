                        <h1>Acacia lentiscifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia lentiscifolia, commonly known as the honey bush, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a resin similar to that of the mastic tree, which has been used historically for various purposes. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia lentiscifolia is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and coastal areas, thriving in dry and sunny environments. This plant is particularly associated with the Iberian Peninsula, Italy, and the Balearic Islands. It is often seen in scrublands and woodlands where it contributes to the local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia lentiscifolia was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions and rocky habitats, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to withstand harsh conditions. This plant has been introduced to several parts of the world, including the United States and Australia, where it has occasionally become invasive. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a potential ecological concern in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful management is necessary to prevent its spread into natural ecosystems.</p>
