                    <h1>Anguina globosa</h1>
<p>Anguina globosa, commonly known as the globular root gall midge, is a small insect that belongs to the family Cecidomyiidae.</p>
<p>It is primarily known for inducing the formation of galls on the roots of certain plants, particularly those in the genus *Cirsium* (thistles). The galls are abnormal growths that develop as a result of the insect's feeding activities, providing both shelter and nutrients for the developing larvae. These galls can significantly affect the growth and health of the host plant.</p>
<p>The life cycle of *Anguina globosa* involves multiple stages, with adults emerging from the galls in the spring to begin the cycle anew.</p>
