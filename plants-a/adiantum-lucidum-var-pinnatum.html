                    <h1>Adiantum lucidum var. pinnatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum lucidum var. pinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant thrives in humid, shady environments and prefers well-draining, moist soil. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced by new growth.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
