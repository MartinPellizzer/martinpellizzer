                    <h1>Aspalathoides hermanniae</h1>
<p>Aspalathoides hermanniae, commonly known as Hermann's rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It is closely related to the more well-known rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) but is less commercially cultivated.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
