                <h1>Actinodaphne mollis</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne mollis, commonly known as the fragrant laurel, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne mollis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne mollis has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring white to pale yellow petals and stamens, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns from green to red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne mollis is primarily native to Sumatera.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of Indonesia. The plant thrives in humid and warm environments, often growing in lowland areas. It is commonly found in the undergrowth of dense forests, where it receives partial shade.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to Sumatera, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne mollis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in humid environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes where it serves both aesthetic and functional purposes. The plant's adaptability to various soil types and its resistance to certain pests make it a popular choice for horticultural use. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, careful management is necessary to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
