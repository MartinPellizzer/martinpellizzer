                    <h1>Agave victoriae-reginae f. ornata</h1>
<p>Agave victoriae-reginae f. ornata, commonly known as the Queen of the Night, is a rare and striking plant native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that emerges at night, hence its common name. The plant produces large, white, tubular flowers that bloom only once in its lifetime, typically during the night. It has thick, fleshy leaves that are blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after by collectors and requires specific growing conditions to thrive.</p>
