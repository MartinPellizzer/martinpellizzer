<p>Alvaradoa amorphoides subsp.</p>
<p>typica, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its succulent leaves and deep root system. It has small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
