                    <h1>Agave whitackeri</h1>
<p>Agave whitackeri, commonly known as the Desert Agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a thick, spiky rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence bearing yellowish-green flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. Its leaves are lined with sharp, backward-pointing spines, providing defense against herbivores.</p>
<p>Agave whitackeri is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
