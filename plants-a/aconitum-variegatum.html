                <h1>Aconitum variegatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum variegatum, commonly known as the variegated monkshood, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear large, hood-shaped flowers in shades of purple, blue, or white. The plant's leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum variegatum has leaves that are palmately compound, with three to five leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, dark green on top, and lighter green underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing upright and reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, arranged in racemes, and have five petal-like sepals and a spurred calyx, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, serving as storage organs for nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum variegatum is primarily native to Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Czechia-Slovakia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, North Caucasus, NW.</p>
<p>Balkan Pen., Poland, Romania, Switzerland, Transcaucasus, Turkey, and Ukraine. It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine regions across these areas.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and forested slopes. It is known for its striking blue to purple flowers and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Its native range spans much of Central and Eastern Europe, with some populations extending into the Caucasus region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum variegatum was mainly introduced to ornamental gardens and naturalized areas due to its attractive foliage and unique flower structure.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its striking blue-violet flowers and dark green, variegated leaves. The plant has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads through both seeds and rhizomes.</p>
<p>Care must be taken with its handling, as it contains toxic alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>
