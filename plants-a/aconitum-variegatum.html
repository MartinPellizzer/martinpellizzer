                    <h1>Aconitum variegatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum variegatum, commonly known as the variegated monkshood, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear large, hood-shaped flowers in shades of purple, blue, or white. The plant's leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
