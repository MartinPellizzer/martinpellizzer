                    <h1>Agrostis rupestris var. uliginosa</h1>
<p>Agrostis rupestris var. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and fens. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to low-nutrient conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of undisturbed, nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
