                <h1>Achillea aspleniifolia var. hungaricum</h1>
<p>Achillea aspleniifolia var. hungaricum, commonly known as Hungarian yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the genus Asplenium, giving it its species name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea aspleniifolia var. hungaricum has narrowly lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and slender, with a smooth, light green bark, and it grows in a clump-forming pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flower heads composed of many tiny florets, blooming in early summer and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a dry, achene type, with seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea aspleniifolia var. hungaricum is a rare plant species native to parts of Central and Eastern Europe, particularly Hungary and adjacent regions.</p>
<p>While its native range was once broader, its current distribution is limited to specific areas in Hungary, where it grows in moist, calcareous soils. It thrives in shaded, woodland environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This plant typically occurs at moderate altitudes, ranging from 300 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea aspleniifolia var. hungaricum is a low-growing perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and subtle yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, going through active growth in spring and summer, followed by a rest period in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation. Fertilize it lightly in spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune back any dead or damaged foliage after flowering. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with grasses or other low-maintenance perennials can enhance its appearance and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea aspleniifolia var. hungaricum is a low-growing perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering shelter and sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea aspleniifolia var. hungaricum is a lesser-known plant with limited direct culinary or medicinal uses due to its rarity and restricted habitat.</p>
<p>It is primarily of interest to botanists and ecologists for its role in supporting local biodiversity and as an indicator of specific soil conditions. While it does not have significant industrial or economic applications, it may hold potential for research in phytochemistry or conservation biology. Culturally, it is not widely recognized or symbolically significant in human traditions.</p>
<p>Its preservation is important for maintaining ecological balance in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea aspleniifolia var. hungaricum has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Flore Pleno' and 'Albiflora', which are known for their striking white or pale pink flowers and finely cut foliage.</p>
<p>While there are no widely recognized hybrids specifically developed for this variety, it is often used as a parent in crosses with other achillea species to create new cultivars with enhanced traits. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a variety of conditions and its role in attracting pollinators to garden spaces. This plant is particularly valued for its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and hardiness contribute to its growing popularity among gardeners seeking low-maintenance, visually appealing plants.</p>
