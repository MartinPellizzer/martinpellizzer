                <h1>Acinodendron ligustrinum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron ligustrinum, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, giving it a snowball-like appearance. The plant has simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves that are elliptical in shape. It produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Acinodendron ligustrinum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ligustrinum has leaves that are opposite in arrangement, ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ligustrinum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in both natural and cultivated environments.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of Indonesia and the Philippines as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ligustrinum was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for erosion control.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1950s and has since spread along coastal areas and disturbed sites. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in sandy soils near the coastline. Despite its aesthetic value, it has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Monitoring and management efforts are ongoing to prevent further spread and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
