                        <h1>Acantholimon cupreo-olivascens</h1>
<p>Acantholimon cupreo-olivascens, commonly known as the copper-olive flaxwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pinkish to purplish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon cupreo-olivascens belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some green algae, characterized by their ability to perform photosynthesis and their complex cellular structures. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many ancient and modern species, often with primitive floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants with distinctive flowers and often adaptations to arid environments. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly found in arid and coastal regions, known for their often showy flowers and medicinal properties. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid and rocky habitats, characterized by their succulent leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon cupreo-olivascens, a specific type of plant known for its distinctive yellow-green flowers and its adaptation to harsh, dry environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon cupreo-olivascens is primarily native to Iran.</p>
