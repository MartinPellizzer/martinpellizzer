<p>Allobia portlandica, commonly known as the Portland allobia, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in coastal or semi-coastal habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are slender and upright.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Allobia portlandica is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
