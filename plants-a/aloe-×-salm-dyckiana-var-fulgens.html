                    <h1>Aloe × salm-dyckiana var. fulgens</h1>
<p>Aloe × salm-dyckiana var. fulgens, commonly known as the fire aloe, is a hybrid plant that exhibits a striking combination of traits from its parent species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and produces clusters of orange-red flowers during the warmer months. The leaves are thick, fleshy, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. This variety is native to southern Africa and is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
