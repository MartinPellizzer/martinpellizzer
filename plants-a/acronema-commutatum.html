                <h1>Acronema commutatum</h1>
<p>Acronema commutatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved madder, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots contain a red pigment called rubia, which has been historically used in dyeing textiles.</p>
<p>Acronema commutatum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronema commutatum has leaves that are alternate, elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length; they are usually a dark green on top and lighter on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to brown bark that becomes rough with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema commutatum is primarily native to China South-Central and Tibet.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in temperate to alpine environments. Its distribution is largely confined to these specific geographic regions.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema commutatum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often along forest floors or in wetlands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures, making it common in temperate zones. The plant is typically found in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in such conditions. Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species in invaded habitats.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions where it lacks natural predators.</p>
