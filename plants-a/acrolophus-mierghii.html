                <h1>Acrolophus mierghii</h1>
<p>Acrolophus mierghii, commonly known as the Persian grass.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers.</p>
<p>Acrolophus mierghii is adapted to drought conditions and is often used for erosion control in degraded landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolophus mierghii has leaves that are narrow and lanceolate, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green bark that remains smooth as the plant grows. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolophus mierghii is primarily native to the Mediterranean Basin, including regions in southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Spain, France, Italy, Morocco, and Turkey. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, or calcareous soils and is often associated with Mediterranean shrublands and steppe environments. It is also present in parts of the Middle East, including Israel and Jordan.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific ecological conditions, its distribution is relatively limited and localized.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolophus mierghii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soil. The plant is often found in regions with a temperate climate, though it can adapt to a range of conditions. Its introduction has been documented in several countries in Europe and parts of North America.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common weed in agricultural and urban settings.</p>
