<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are usually pinnately divided, with a pale green to silver-white coloration that helps reflect sunlight in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Anogramma chaerophylla is adapted to low moisture conditions and is often found in rocky outcrops and crevices.</p>
