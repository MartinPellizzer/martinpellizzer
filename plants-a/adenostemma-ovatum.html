                <h1>Adenostemma ovatum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma ovatum, commonly known as the woolly leaf false morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Adenostemma ovatum is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant blooms and unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma ovatum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 2 to 6 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are erect and branching, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, exhibiting a growth pattern that is typically bushy. Its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes, featuring small tubular flowers with five petals, typically pink to reddish in color, blooming from summer to autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptic seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and wing-like structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma ovatum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, lowland areas such as wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of the Caribbean and northern Australia.</p>
<p>Adenostemma ovatum is known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable forage plant and a potential weed in certain environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma ovatum was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activities such as accidental transport in soil or on vehicles. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and has spread across various habitats, including coastal dunes and dry forests. Its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation have led to ecological concerns.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
