                    <h1>Adelia anomala</h1>
<p>Adelia anomala, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Adelia anomala plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though its ecological significance is not as well-studied as other milkweed species.</p>
