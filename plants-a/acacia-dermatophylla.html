                        <h1>Acacia dermatophylla</h1>
<p>Acacia dermatophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. Acacia dermatophylla is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and low rainfall environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various native fauna.</p>
