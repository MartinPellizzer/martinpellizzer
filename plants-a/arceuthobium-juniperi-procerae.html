                    <h1>Arceuthobium juniperi-procerae</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium juniperi-procerae, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of juniper trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with both the host tree and avian vectors.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its unique method of seed dispersal, where the seeds are projected up to several meters using a mechanism called autochory.</p>
