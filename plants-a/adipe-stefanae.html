                <h1>Adipe stefanae</h1>
<p>Adipe stefanae, commonly known as the Stefanae's Fat Plant, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its arid and rocky habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Adipe stefanae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adipe stefanae has leaves that are ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green color with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough as the plant matures, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipe stefanae is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, specifically southern France, Italy, and parts of Spain.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in rocky and coastal areas where it can access ample sunlight and well-drained soil. It is commonly found in areas with mild, temperate climates and minimal seasonal frost. Adipe stefanae is often associated with limestone substrates and is frequently seen growing on cliffs or in open fields.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipe stefanae was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in well-drained soil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with mild winters and long growing seasons. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It has been introduced to several countries in the Mediterranean and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
