                    <h1>Adipe stefanae</h1>
<p>Adipe stefanae, commonly known as the Stefanae's Fat Plant, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its arid and rocky habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Adipe stefanae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
