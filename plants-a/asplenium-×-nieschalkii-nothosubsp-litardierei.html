<p>Asplenium × nieschalkii nothosubsp.</p>
<p>litardierei, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, dark green fronds that resemble those of its parent species.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities.</p>
