                <h1>Acer opalus var. rotundifolium</h1>
<p>Acer opalus var. rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded leaves that are often lobed and have a velvety texture. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer opalus var. rotundifolium has palmately lobed leaves that are broadly ovate with rounded lobes, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, displaying a vibrant green on the upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with a structure of separate sepals and petals, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed, which is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer opalus var. rotundifolium is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe, particularly in parts of the Carpathian Basin.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in Hungary and western Ukraine. It thrives in temperate climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils along river valleys and in mixed forests. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 400 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural reproduction, it is classified as critically endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer opalus var. rotundifolium is a striking ornamental tree known for its unique, rounded leaves and vibrant autumn color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The tree grows slowly, reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil, requiring moderate watering during dry periods. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with other shade-tolerant plants like ferns and hostas in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer opalus var. rotundifolium is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in landscaping, enhancing aesthetic value while supporting local ecosystems. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves soil quality through organic matter accumulation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer opalus var. rotundifolium is a decorative plant primarily valued for its ornamental use in horticulture and landscape design due to its unique, rounded leaves and vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its aesthetic appeal makes it a popular choice for gardens and public spaces. In traditional medicine, some parts of the plant may have been used for minor therapeutic purposes, though scientific validation remains limited. Culturally, it symbolizes beauty and resilience, often featured in local art and botanical collections.</p>
<p>Economically, it contributes to the ornamental plant industry, supporting horticultural trade and tourism in regions where it is cultivated.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer opalus var. rotundifolium has several popular cultivars, including 'Gumpo' and 'Taurinense', which are prized for their unique foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is also involved in the creation of hybrids such as Acer x carpinifolium, which combines traits from both Acer opalus and Acer tatarinowii. These varieties and hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their vibrant autumn colors and compact growth habit. They are commonly used in gardens and landscapes to add visual interest and seasonal appeal.</p>
<p>Their adaptability to various climates further enhances their horticultural importance.</p>
