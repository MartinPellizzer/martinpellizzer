                <h1>Acleisanthes berlandieri</h1>
<p>Acleisanthes berlandieri, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a hairy texture. It has a short, thick stem and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it well-suited for desert ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes berlandieri has leaves that are oblanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright.

<p>It is found in regions such as Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and parts of Sonora and Chihuahua. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often associated with desert and semi-desert environments. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Acleisanthes berlandieri is an important part of the local flora in these arid regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes berlandieri was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along fences. This species thrives in dry, arid environments and is often seen in rocky soils. It is considered an invasive plant in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>The distribution of Acleisanthes berlandieri has expanded due to human activity and its adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>
