                <h1>Acilepis dalzelliana</h1>
<p>Acilepis dalzelliana, commonly known as the Dalzell's acacia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and produces small, yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dune environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis dalzelliana has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green, glossy upper surface with a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring five petals that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis dalzelliana is primarily native to the eastern and central regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in woodland and savanna habitats, often growing in areas with well-drained soils. This plant is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of these regions, thriving in warm and humid conditions. It is often seen in natural vegetation alongside other native flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Acilepis dalzelliana is not widely distributed beyond its native range and is not commonly cultivated outside of its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis dalzelliana was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas, particularly in regions with a temperate climate. Its spread has been limited but it is considered a potential weed in some native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and minimize its impact on local flora.</p>
