                <h1>Acrosorus subtriangularis</h1>
<p>Acrosorus subtriangularis, commonly known as the triangular fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped fronds. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces erect, lanceolate leaves with a serrated margin. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Acrosorus subtriangularis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrosorus subtriangularis has leaves that are subtriangular in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers with yellow stamens and a greenish pistil, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosorus subtriangularis is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and along riverbanks where the climate is humid and the soil is rich in organic matter. This species thrives in shaded environments and is often associated with the understory of dense vegetation. Its natural habitat includes areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures throughout the year.</p>
<p>Acrosorus subtriangularis is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosorus subtriangularis was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there accidentally through the importation of contaminated soil or plant material. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has spread along the forest floor in native ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats have led to the displacement of native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
