The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, with the fronds arising from a short, creeping rhizome. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its morphology makes it a valuable subject for botanical study, particularly in understanding fern evolution and adaptation.</p>
