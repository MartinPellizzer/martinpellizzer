                <h1>Acer monspessulanum f. illyricum</h1>
<p>Acer monspessulanum f. illyricum, commonly known as the Illyrian maple, is a rare and distinctive variety of maple native to the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring leaves with a broad, ovate shape and a striking combination of green and yellow hues. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities and adaptability to specific growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum f. illyricum has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, turning red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin strips as the tree matures. It produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers in early spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The root system is shallow and fibrous, adapted to stabilize the plant in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum f. illyricum is a rare and ancient form of the maple tree native to the Apennine Mountains of southern Italy.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the regions of Apulia and Calabria. It thrives in humid, temperate environments, often found in shaded, moist woodlands and along stream banks. This species typically grows at altitudes between 300 and 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum f. illyricum is a unique cultivar of the maple tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining its specific traits. This slow-growing tree has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth occurring in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in early spring, and pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>
