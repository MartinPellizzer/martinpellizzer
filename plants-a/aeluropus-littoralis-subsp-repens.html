<p>Aeluropus littoralis subsp.</p>
<p>repens, commonly known as the creeping saltgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and stabilize coastal soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in intertidal zones and saline soils, often found in estuaries and salt marshes.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
