<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha jardinii is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern part of the island, specifically in the humid lowland and montane forest regions. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is commonly found in the undergrowth of primary forests. It is a shrub or small tree that plays an important role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha jardinii was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and vibrant flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in countries such as Australia, the United States, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure.
