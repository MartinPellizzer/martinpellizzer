                <h1>Acer rumelicum</h1>
<p>Acer rumelicum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically green in summer and turn red, orange, or yellow in autumn. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>Acer rumelicum prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along rivers and streams.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rumelicum has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rumelicum is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to some botanical gardens and conservation sites outside its original habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in shaded forest understories. This species grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, Acer rumelicum is considered endangered and requires protection to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rumelicum is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its unique foliage and slow growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity over several decades, making it suitable for long-term landscape planning.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or heathers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer rumelicum is a small, deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other native species. Its dense root system helps in erosion control, preventing soil loss in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer rumelicum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and supporting the health of surrounding vegetation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer rumelicum is a lesser-known tree species that has limited direct culinary use but is occasionally used in traditional herbal remedies for its potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its wood, though not widely used industrially, has been historically valued for small woodworking projects due to its fine grain and workability. In some regions, it holds cultural significance and is used in local festivals or as a symbol of resilience. Despite its modest role in modern economies, it contributes to biodiversity and ecological balance in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer rumelicum's applications remain largely symbolic and traditional, with limited practical uses in contemporary contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer rumelicum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegatum' and 'Atropurpureum', which are known for their striking foliage colors. The plant has been hybridized with other maple species to produce cultivars with enhanced growth habits and coloration. These hybrids are often favored in horticulture for their adaptability to different climates.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer rumelicum and its cultivars hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and versatility in landscaping.</p>
