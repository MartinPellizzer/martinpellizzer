<p>Aspidium weberi, commonly known as the Weber's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium weberi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
