                <h1>Acer ginnala subsp. euginnala</h1>
<p>Acer ginnala subsp.</p>
<p>euginnala, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange foliage in autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite, palmately lobed, and typically have five to seven lobes. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds.</p>
<p>The tree prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala subsp.</p>
<p>euginnala has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in diameter, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is smooth and slender, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, yellow-green, and clustered in catkins, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala subsp.</p>
<p>euginnala is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in central and southern China.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates, growing in moist, well-drained soils within shaded or semi-shaded forest environments. This subspecies typically occurs at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala subsp.</p>
<p>euginnala is a small, ornamental tree known for its vibrant red flowers and maple-like leaves. It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>The growth cycle involves a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering promote healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lavender or marigold can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala subsp.</p>
<p>euginnala is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its early spring flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense growth also helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and offering habitat for insects and other small animals.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala subsp.</p>
<p>euginnala is a decorative tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage, making it a popular choice in ornamental horticulture. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
