                    <h1>Adenocarpum</h1>
<p>Adenocarpum, commonly known as the "false thistle," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers. Adenocarpum species typically have hairy stems and leaves, and their leaves are often alternate and sometimes lobed. The fruits are dry, indehiscent capsules called achenes, which are often surrounded by a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>They are found in various habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils, across temperate regions of the world.</p>
