<p>Allosorus cambodiensis, commonly known as the Cambodian water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Salviniales and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both free-floating and rooted stages, which allows it to thrive in various aquatic environments. Its spores are dispersed by water currents, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Allosorus cambodiensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
