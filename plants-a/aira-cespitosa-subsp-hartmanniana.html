<p>Aira cespitosa subsp.</p>
<p>hartmanniana, commonly known as Hartmann's tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form compact clumps.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
