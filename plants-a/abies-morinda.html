<p>Abies morinda, commonly known as the Morinda fir, is a rare and lesser-known conifer native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown in color, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic study.</p>
