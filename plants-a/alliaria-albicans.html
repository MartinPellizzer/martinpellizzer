                    <h1>Alliaria albicans</h1>
<p>Alliaria albicans, commonly known as white liverwort, is a small, mat-forming plant belonging to the family Ptychanthaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its preferred moist, shaded habitats. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color, and it is often found growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Alliaria albicans is an indicator species for acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often used in ecological studies to assess environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and adaptability make it a notable component of woodland and rocky ecosystems.</p>
