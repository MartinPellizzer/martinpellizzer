                    <h1>Agave gypsophila</h1>
<p>Agave gypsophila, commonly known as the ghost agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, upright rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence bearing small, white, star-shaped flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-resistant.</p>
<p>Agave gypsophila is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
