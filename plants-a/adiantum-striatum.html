                <h1>Adiantum striatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum striatum, commonly known as the striped maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive silver or white stripe along the central vein. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a graceful, arching appearance that adds ornamental value to gardens and indoor spaces.</p>
<p>Adiantum striatum is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its elegant foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum striatum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, with a smooth texture and a narrow, lance-shaped form, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a creeping or upright pattern depending on the environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, appearing in early spring, though they are often overlooked due to their simplicity.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in its clumping growth habit.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum striatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in forested areas and along stream banks. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often associated with limestone substrates. Its native range extends into parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands as well.</p>
<p>It is a popular ornamental plant due to its delicate, lacy fronds.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum striatum was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, delicate fronds.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This species has been reported in several states, including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and North Carolina. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in natural habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, proper management is necessary to prevent its spread into native ecosystems.</p>
