                <h1>Acosta pinnata</h1>
<p>Acosta pinnata, commonly known as the golden pinnate, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble a fan or shuttle, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Acosta pinnata typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and has adapted to the cool, dry climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta pinnata has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape, with a glossy green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5 to 15 centimeters long and are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers with five petals, blooming in the spring, and is pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta pinnata is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, including countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the foothills and valleys of the Andes, where it thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. This plant is often associated with rocky soils and can be found in both forested and open habitats. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Acosta pinnata is also sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta pinnata was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in warm climates with high humidity and is often used for erosion control due to its rapid growth. It has been introduced to several countries in South America, particularly in regions with similar ecological conditions.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become an invasive species in non-native environments.</p>
