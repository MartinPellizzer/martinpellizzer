<p>Adiantum subvolubile, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that resemble the wings of a bird, giving it its common name. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and dying back after spore production.</p>
