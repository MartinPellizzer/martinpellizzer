                <h1>Aechmea decurva</h1>
<p>Aechmea decurva, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a perennial evergreen plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture and a reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces striking inflorescences with colorful bracts that can range from red to orange.</p>
<p>Aechmea decurva is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and ability to thrive in humid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea decurva has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, sword-like, and arranged in a spiral pattern around the central stem, with a dark green to bluish-gray coloration.</p>
<p>The stem is short and often hidden beneath the leaves, with a smooth, grayish-brown texture and a growth pattern that is mostly subterranean. The plant produces inflorescences of clustered, white or pale pink flowers, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects such as bees and beetles. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains small, black seeds, which are dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in the soil, with some rhizomes extending to form new rosettes.</p>
