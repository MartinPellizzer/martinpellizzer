                    <h1>Asplenium donnell-smithii</h1>
<p>Asplenium donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith's spleenwort, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic fern that grows on the bark of trees, particularly in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a dark green color and a serrated margin. It reproduces through spores, which are released from the underside of its fertile fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are essential to preserve this unique botanical species.</p>
