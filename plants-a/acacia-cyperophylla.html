<p>Acacia cyperophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, feathery foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has small, bean-like pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system and waxy leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acacia cyperophylla plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
