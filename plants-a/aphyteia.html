                    <h1>Aphyteia</h1>
<p>Aphyteia, commonly known as the "ghost plant," is a unique species of liverwort that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along the edges of water bodies. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, a leaf-like structure that absorbs nutrients directly from the environment. Aphyteia reproduces through spores, which are released into the air and germinate under suitable conditions.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in nutrient-poor habitats makes it an important indicator of ecological health.</p>
