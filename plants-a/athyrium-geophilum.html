<p>Athyrium geophilum, commonly known as the ground-ferns or the common wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, arching growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to the soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Athyrium geophilum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in cool, humid climates.</p>
