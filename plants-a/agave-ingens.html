                    <h1>Agave ingens</h1>
<p>Agave ingens, commonly known as the giant century plant, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length, forming a dense rosette. The plant produces a towering inflorescence with numerous white or yellowish flowers, which bloom only once in its lifetime. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and dramatic flowering event, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens.</p>
