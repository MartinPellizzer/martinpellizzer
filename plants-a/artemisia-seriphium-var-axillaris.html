<p>Artemisia seriphium var. axillaris, commonly known as the woolly wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow to greenish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its aromatic compounds, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a source of natural insect repellent.</p>
