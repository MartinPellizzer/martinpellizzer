                <h1>Aegilops pontica</h1>
<p>Aegilops pontica, commonly known as the Pontic goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus and parts of Anatolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous颖果 (glumes) with short, awned bracts. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Aegilops pontica is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops pontica has leaves that are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem, with a grass-like appearance, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length and 2 to 4 mm in width, and are usually a muted green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to pale yellow color, growing upright and branching sparingly. The flowers are small and spike-like, with pale green to beige florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-angled, dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, with each seed having a slender, winged structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>
