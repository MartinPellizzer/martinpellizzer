                    <h1>Aegilops pontica</h1>
<p>Aegilops pontica, commonly known as the Pontic goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus and parts of Anatolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous颖果 (glumes) with short, awned bracts. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Aegilops pontica is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
