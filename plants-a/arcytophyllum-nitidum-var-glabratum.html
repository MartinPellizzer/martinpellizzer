<p>Arcytophyllum nitidum var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth sandarac plant, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cupressaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are coated with a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh, dry environment.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
