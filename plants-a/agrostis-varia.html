                    <h1>Agrostis varia</h1>
<p>Agrostis varia, commonly known as the variable bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its variability in leaf and inflorescence morphology, which contributes to its common name.</p>
