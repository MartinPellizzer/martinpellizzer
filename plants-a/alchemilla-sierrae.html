<p>Alchemilla sierrae, commonly known as Sierra lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of basal, silver-haired leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters atop leafless stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and moisture-retaining properties.</p>
<p>Alchemilla sierrae is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
