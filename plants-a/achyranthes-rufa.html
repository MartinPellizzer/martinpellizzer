                <h1>Achyranthes rufa</h1>
<p>Achyranthes rufa, commonly known as red bignay, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes rufa has compound leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with lanceolate or ovate leaflets ranging from 2 to 6 cm in length, and a generally dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a rough texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a pale greenish-white color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, with each seed having a small tuft of hair for aid in flight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes rufa is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is now also present in parts of Africa and the Middle East due to human introduction. This species thrives in moist, fertile soils in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing near water sources like streams and rivers. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its distribution is becoming more restricted due to habitat loss and land use changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyranthes rufa is a hardy annual plant known for its vibrant red bracts that attract pollinators and add visual interest to gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds sown directly in the garden or started indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost. The growth cycle begins with germination in spring, followed by rapid growth and flowering in late summer, with the plant dying off after the first frost.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning spent flowers encourages continuous blooming. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like powdery mildew may occur in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden biodiversity.</p>
