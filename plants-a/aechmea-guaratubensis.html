                <h1>Aechmea guaratubensis</h1>
<p>Aechmea guaratubensis, commonly known as the Guaratubense Bromeliad, is a species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight.</p>
<p>This bromeliad is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea guaratubensis has rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow, pointed, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a dark green color and a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a prominent stem, with a short, fibrous base that resembles a pseudobark, and it grows upright from the base. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by bright red bracts, with small white to yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in the soil, with some aerial roots that aid in water absorption.</p>
