                    <h1>Alsophila serrae</h1>
<p>Alsophila serrae, commonly known as the serrated tree fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the velamen. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance. Alsophila serrae thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are located at the base of the trunk, a feature typical of many tree ferns.</p>
