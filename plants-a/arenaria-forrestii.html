<p>Arenaria forrestii, commonly known as the Tibetan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Arenaria forrestii is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
