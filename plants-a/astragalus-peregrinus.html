<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to survive in harsh, sandy environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution across its native range.</p>
