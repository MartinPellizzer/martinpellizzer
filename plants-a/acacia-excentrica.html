                    <h1>Acacia excentrica</h1>
<p>Acacia excentrica, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, phyllodes that are typically green and pointed. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular heads, which appear in spring and attract various pollinators. Acacia excentrica is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a feature common in many acacia species, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
