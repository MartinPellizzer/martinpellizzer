                    <h1>Asplenium obtusatum var. normale</h1>
<p>Asplenium obtusatum var. normale, commonly known as the broad-leafed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are broadly ovate and often have a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically clustered in groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in humid, temperate climates.</p>
