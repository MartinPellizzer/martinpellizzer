                <h1>Acronychia reticulata</h1>
<p>Acronychia reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined acronychia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to northern Australia and parts of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It is often found in coastal and lowland rainforest habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia reticulata has compound, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 5â€“15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is grey to brown in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a dense, rounded crown. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, with four petals and four sepals, arranged in clusters; they bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia reticulata is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in the eastern and western regions. This plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks or in mountainous areas. It is known for its distinctive, rough-textured leaves and small, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>Acronychia reticulata is an important component of the local flora and is sometimes used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia reticulata was mainly introduced to urban and coastal areas for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides where it can tolerate partial shade and moderate water conditions. The plant is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and resilience to urban environments. However, it has the potential to spread into native habitats if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited to regions with warm climates and well-drained soils.</p>
