                <h1>Achyranthes echinocephala</h1>
<p>Achyranthes echinocephala, commonly known as the spiky beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiky, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and waste grounds.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common weed in many parts of the world.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes echinocephala has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, somewhat woody, with a rough, greyish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, with greenish-white petals and stamens, blooming in the summer months and primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes echinocephala is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Sudan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist lowland areas, often growing in disturbed soils near human settlements. This plant thrives in environments with high humidity and partial shade, making it a common sight in savannas and woodland edges. It is also present in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka, where it has been introduced.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of the Middle East, where it is adapted to similar climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes echinocephala was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as trade, agriculture, and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and areas with human activity, making it a pioneer species in certain environments. This plant has adapted well to various climates and can thrive in both tropical and subtropical regions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems remains a subject of ongoing research.</p>
