<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes echinocephala has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough texture and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat branched, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, with pale yellow petals and stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a three-valved capsule that releases small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
