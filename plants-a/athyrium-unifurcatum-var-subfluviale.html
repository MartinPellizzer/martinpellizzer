<p>Athyrium unifurcatum var. subfluviale, commonly known as the river fern, is a variant of the common wood fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly glossy texture. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid woodlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas.</p>
