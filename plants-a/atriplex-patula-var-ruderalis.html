                    <h1>Atriplex patula var. ruderalis</h1>
<p>Atriplex patula var. ruderalis, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a halophyte native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and abandoned fields, due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize bare ground. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This hardy species plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
