                <h1>Acer buergerianum subsp. formosanum</h1>
<p>Acer buergerianum subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan maple, is a deciduous tree native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more rugged with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-7 lobes, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in inflorescences during late spring, with separate male and female flowers, and is wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum is a rare and endemic species native to Taiwan, specifically found in the central and southern mountainous regions. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations within these areas, primarily in the central mountain range.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in humid, temperate forests with well-drained soils and partial to full shade. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red leaves and compact growth habit. It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>This species grows best in spring and summer, reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and regular watering, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and birds. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring blossoms.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity and promoting ecological balance. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and fertility.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum is a species of maple native to Taiwan, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.</p>
<p>In industrial contexts, its wood is valued for its durability and fine texture, making it suitable for furniture and craftsmanship. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in Taiwanese horticulture and is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Overall, it contributes to both local biodiversity and the economic value of the region's plant resources.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer buergerianum subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum has several popular cultivars, including 'Variegatum' and 'Cunninghamii', which are prized for their striking foliage and ornamental value. The species is also involved in various hybrids, such as with other maple species, to enhance traits like cold hardiness and leaf coloration.</p>
<p>These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes. Their unique leaf patterns and adaptability make them valuable additions to ornamental plant collections.</p>
<p>Due to their visual interest and relatively easy care, they hold significant horticultural importance in both residential and public gardens.</p>
