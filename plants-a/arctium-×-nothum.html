                    <h1>Arctium × nothum</h1>
<p>Arctium × nothum, commonly known as the common burr.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Arctium lappa (greater burdock) and Arctium tomentosum (tomentose burdock). The plant is characterized by its large, spiky seed heads that contain hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>The leaves are broadly lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture, and the plant can reach heights of up to 2 meters.</p>
