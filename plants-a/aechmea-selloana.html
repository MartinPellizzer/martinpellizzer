                <h1>Aechmea selloana</h1>
<p>Aechmea selloana, commonly known as the Sello's bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red bracts that enclose small white flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Aechmea selloana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea selloana has rosette-shaped leaves that are sword-like, arranged in a tight spiral, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, fibrous base that supports the rosette. Its inflorescence is a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, with small, white to pink flowers that bloom during the rainy season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for water absorption, helping the plant thrive in moist environments.</p>
