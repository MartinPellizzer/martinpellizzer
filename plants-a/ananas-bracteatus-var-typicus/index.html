<p>Cabbage pineapple, scientifically known as Ananas bracteatus var. typicus, is a unique and lesser-known member of the bromeliad family. Native to the tropical regions of South America, this plant has fascinated botanists and plant enthusiasts alike with its unusual appearance and growth habits. Unlike its more common cousin, the pineapple, the cabbage pineapple features a dense cluster of fleshy, cabbage-like leaves that form a rosette structure. Its striking foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments make it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Despite its rarity in commercial cultivation, it holds significant value in botanical research and ornamental horticulture.</p>
