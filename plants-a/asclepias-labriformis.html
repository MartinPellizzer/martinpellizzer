                    <h1>Asclepias labriformis</h1>
<p>Asclepias labriformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are arranged in umbels and attract various pollinators. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to many herbivores.</p>
<p>Asclepias labriformis plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
