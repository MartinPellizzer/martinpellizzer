                    <h1>Asplenium × capillicaule</h1>
<p>Asplenium × capillicaule, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered with soft, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in small, round groups.</p>
<p>Asplenium × capillicaule is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
