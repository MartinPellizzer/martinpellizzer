                    <h1>Amylotheca comptonii</h1>
<p>Amylotheca comptonii, commonly known as the Compton's ghost flower, is a rare and striking member of the Mesembryanthemaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often blue or purple-colored flowers that appear during the cooler months. Its succulent leaves are fleshy and adapted to store water, reflecting its drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
