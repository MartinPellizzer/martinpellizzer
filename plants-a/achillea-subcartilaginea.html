                <h1>Achillea subcartilaginea</h1>
<p>Achillea subcartilaginea, commonly known as the brittle yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant features slender, wiry stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and arranged in flat-topped clusters, typical of the genus Achillea.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea subcartilaginea has narrow, linear leaves that are often bluish-gray in color, arranged in a basal rosette, and measure up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a light green color, growing in a compact, bushy form. Its flowers are small, yellowish-white composite structures with ray florets, blooming from June to August and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea subcartilaginea is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly the Pyrenees and the Alps.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. This species is commonly found in alpine meadows and open slopes where it receives full sun exposure. It is adapted to cold climates and is often part of the vegetation in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and localized plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea subcartilaginea was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in natural habitats. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now widespread across various regions of New Zealand.</p>
