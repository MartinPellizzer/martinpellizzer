<p>Alchemilla arcuatiloba, commonly known as the silverweed or false agrimony, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to round, with a silvery-white underside due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in loose clusters atop the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Alchemilla arcuatiloba is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas.</p>
