                <h1>Aegiphila cuneata</h1>
<p>Aegiphila cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Aegiphila cuneata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila cuneata has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, grayish bark, and grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb water efficiently from the dry, rocky habitat.</p>
