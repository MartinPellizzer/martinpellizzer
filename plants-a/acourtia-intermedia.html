                <h1>Acourtia intermedia</h1>
<p>Acourtia intermedia, commonly known as the slender acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, yellowish to white flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Acourtia intermedia is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia intermedia has small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a light green, smooth bark that tends to branch out in a sprawling growth pattern. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring pink to purple petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia intermedia is primarily native to Mexico Northeast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in open habitats. It is adapted to the harsh climate conditions of the region.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific areas within northeastern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia intermedia was mainly introduced to the western coast of North America, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils along the Pacific shoreline. This plant thrives in saline and well-drained environments, making it well-suited for coastal ecosystems. Its introduction has led to some concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>It is often considered an invasive species in areas where it has become established.</p>
