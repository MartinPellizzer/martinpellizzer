<p>Aspidium decurtatum, commonly known as the cut-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Aspidium decurtatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
