                <h1>Abelia chinensis var. ionandra</h1>
<p>Abelia chinensis var. ionandra, commonly known as the Chinese abelia or red abelia, is a deciduous shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It features showy, tubular flowers that range from white to pink and red, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Abelia chinensis var. ionandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelia chinensis var. ionandra has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and they exhibit an upright, shrub-like growth pattern. The flowers are clustered in terminal racemes, featuring tubular corollas with five lobes, and are typically pink to red in color, blooming in late spring to early summer; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelia chinensis var. ionandra is a flowering shrub native to China, specifically found in the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes cultivation in gardens and botanical collections across the United States and Europe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, often growing in woodland or rocky habitats. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in its native range, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abelia chinensis var. ionandra is a hardy, ornamental shrub known for its fragrant, pinkish-white flowers and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings in late spring or by seeds, though cuttings yield more consistent results. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 2-3 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun.</p>
<p>Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and promote blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or jasmine can enhance its fragrance and deter pests naturally.</p>
