                    <h1>Acianthera insularis</h1>
<p>Acianthera insularis, commonly known as the island orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acianthera insularis is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
