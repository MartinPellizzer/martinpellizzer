                <h1>Acianthera insularis</h1>
<p>Acianthera insularis, commonly known as the island orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acianthera insularis is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera insularis has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, with three petals and a spurred lip, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera insularis is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in humid, shaded environments. It is commonly associated with coastal areas and lowland forests where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its natural habitat from threats such as habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera insularis was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in various lowland and coastal areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in disturbed habitats. Its introduction is believed to be through accidental transport via human activity.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it has become a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
