                <h1>Adenophora richteri</h1>
<p>Adenophora richteri, commonly known as the Korean bellflower, is a perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Adenophora richteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora richteri has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a single, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and range in color from pale blue to purple, blooming in late summer and early fall, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and anchor itself in moist, woodland soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora richteri is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, specifically China.</p>
<p>It is found in areas such as the provinces of Yunnan, Sichuan, and Shaanxi. This plant thrives in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. It is often associated with alpine meadows and is adapted to the cold, moist climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora richteri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several states including Washington, Oregon, and California. The plant is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. It was likely introduced through horticultural trade or accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native plant species.</p>
