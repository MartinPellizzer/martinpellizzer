                            <h1>Astephanus Dregei</h1>
<p>Astephanus dregei is a unique and lesser-known plant species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, but it stands out with its distinctive appearance. This plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. Despite its modest size, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. Its resilience and adaptability make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
