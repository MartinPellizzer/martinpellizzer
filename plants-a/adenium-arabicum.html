                    <h1>Adenium arabicum</h1>
<p>Adenium arabicum, commonly known as the Desert Trumpet, is a striking succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom at the base of the trunk, adding a dramatic visual contrast. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Adenium arabicum is also known for its toxic sap, which contains cardiac glycosides and is used in traditional medicine and as a poison in some cultures.</p>
