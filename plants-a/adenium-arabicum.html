                <h1>Adenium arabicum</h1>
<p>Adenium arabicum, commonly known as the Desert Trumpet, is a striking succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom at the base of the trunk, adding a dramatic visual contrast. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Adenium arabicum is also known for its toxic sap, which contains cardiac glycosides and is used in traditional medicine and as a poison in some cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenium arabicum has thick, fleshy leaves that are typically oval or elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a distinctive flaky texture. Its flowers are large and showy, with a bright red or orange color, and they bloom during the dry season, pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and flies. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, adapted to store water and nutrients in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium arabicum is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, including countries such as Somalia, Eritrea, and southern Ethiopia, as well as parts of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in coastal areas and rocky terrains. This plant is commonly associated with dry savannas and thorny shrublands where it adapts to extreme heat and limited water availability. It plays a significant role in local ecosystems and has been historically used for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to regions with sandy soils and minimal rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium arabicum was mainly introduced to southern Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive red flowers and unique tree-like structure. The plant is often found in gardens and along roadsides, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It has also been reported in some parts of Australia and the Middle East as an introduced species.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
