<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, Abarema occultata is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema occultata is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest biome of eastern Brazil.</p>
<p>This species is found in the coastal regions of states such as Rio de Janeiro, Esp√≠rito Santo, and Santa Catarina. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in secondary growth areas and disturbed habitats within this region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the Atlantic Forest ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema occultata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and degraded pastures.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it can spread rapidly due to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including agriculture and land clearing.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it has been recorded.</p>
