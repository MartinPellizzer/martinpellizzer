                    <h1>Asplenium theciferum var. concinnum</h1>
<p>Asplenium theciferum var. concinnum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense, low-growing mats.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually short and unbranched, contributing to its ornamental appeal in shaded garden settings.</p>
