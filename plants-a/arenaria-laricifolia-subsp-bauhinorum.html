<p>Arenaria laricifolia subsp.</p>
<p>bauhinorum, commonly known as the Alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for high-altitude environments with strong winds and limited nutrients.</p>
