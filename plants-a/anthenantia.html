                    <h1>Anthenantia</h1>
<p>Anthenantia, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in rocky or alpine environments, where they thrive in well-drained soils. Anthenantia species are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, often fragrant flowers. They possess specialized structures called pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, aiding their survival in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers usually have three sepals and three petals, with the latter often modified into specialized structures for pollination.</p>
