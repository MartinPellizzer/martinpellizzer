<p>Aetheilema javanicum, commonly known as the Java water fern, is a aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, floating fronds that help it absorb sunlight for photosynthesis. Its rhizomes spread along the water's surface, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Aetheilema javanicum plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems by reducing current and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
