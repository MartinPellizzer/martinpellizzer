<p>Aeluropus badghyzi, commonly known as the Persian grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in harsh environments. The plant produces spikelets that are typically pale green to brown, with short, awned lemmas. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important species for ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to extreme conditions makes it a valuable plant for landscaping and erosion control in dry climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus badghyzi has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and compact, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly woody. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to white flowers that bloom in early summer, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, with small, light seeds that are easily carried by the air.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapted to thrive in sandy or saline soils.</p>
