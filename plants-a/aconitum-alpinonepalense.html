                <h1>Aconitum alpinonepalense</h1>
<p>Aconitum alpinonepalense, commonly known as the Himalayan aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves and produces follicular fruits containing seeds with silky appendages. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a dangerous plant and should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum alpinonepalense has leaves that are typically palmately compound, with broad, ovate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, rough to the touch, and has a dark brown to black bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurred lower petal, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum alpinonepalense is primarily native to Tibet.</p>
<p>It is found in the high-altitude regions of this region, typically in alpine meadows and rocky areas. This plant is adapted to the cold and harsh climate of the Tibetan Plateau. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking purple or blue flowers.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Tibet, making it a rare and specialized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum alpinonepalense was mainly introduced to areas with moist, temperate climates, often in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for alpine and subalpine environments. This plant is commonly found in the Himalayas and surrounding regions of Nepal and northern India. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
<p>However, its introduction to new regions may pose ecological risks if it becomes invasive.</p>
