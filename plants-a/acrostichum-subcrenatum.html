                <h1>Acrostichum subcrenatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum subcrenatum, commonly known as the narrow-crenated fern, is a species native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are often arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a distinctive feature in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum subcrenatum has broad, feather-like leaves that are subcrenate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically range from 30 to 60 cm in length, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows in a creeping or rhizomatous pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum subcrenatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove forests and brackish water areas. This plant is well adapted to saline and waterlogged soils, making it a key species in estuarine ecosystems. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Indo-Pacific region, where it forms part of the native flora in coastal wetlands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum subcrenatum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia, where it thrives in saline and sandy soils.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive fronds and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant's distribution has been documented in several states, including New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p>Its presence in these regions highlights the need for monitoring to prevent further spread.</p>
