<p>Atriplex lindleyi, commonly known as silverleaf shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing additional protection against desiccation. It produces small greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Atriplex lindleyi is well adapted to poor soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities.</p>
