                    <h1>Armeria villosa var. longearistata</h1>
<p>Armeria villosa var. longearistata, commonly known as the woolly sea thrift, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and landscape designs.</p>
