                    <h1>Agave americana var. variegata</h1>
<p>Agave americana var. variegata, commonly known as the Variegated Century Plant, is a striking succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green with white or yellow variegation. The plant is characterized by its ability to store water in its leaves, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for arid environments. It produces tall, flowering stalks that bear small, greenish-white flowers, though it rarely fruits in cultivation.</p>
<p>The variegation in its leaves is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in its unique appearance.</p>
