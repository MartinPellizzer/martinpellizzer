                <h1>Acourtia coulteri</h1>
<p>Acourtia coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia coulteri has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a woody, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively smooth. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green structures that appear in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in rocky or arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia coulteri is primarily native to Guatemala, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, and Mexico Southeast.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the southern and eastern regions of Mexico, including the Gulf Coast and the northeastern and southeastern states. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often in areas with well-drained soils. The species is adapted to grow in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its preference for warm, humid environments with mild winters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia coulteri was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils along the edges of coastal dunes and maritime chaparral. This plant is commonly associated with the California coast and is well adapted to the dry, salty conditions of its native habitat. It is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and spreading habit, it requires careful management to prevent its spread beyond its intended range.</p>
