                <h1>Acosmium dasycarpum</h1>
<p>Acosmium dasycarpum, commonly known as the thick-fruited acosmium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive, thick, and fleshy fruits that are often used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and pharmacology.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosmium dasycarpum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are usually green and have a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in umbels, blooming in early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmium dasycarpum is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It is found in states such as Georgia, Florida, and parts of South Carolina. This plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and along stream banks. It is commonly associated with the Appalachian region and is often found in rich, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to this specific geographic area, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmium dasycarpum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, open woodlands, and along stream banks. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Its introduction has led to its spread in natural habitats, sometimes outcompeting native species.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
