                        <h1>Abies hirtella</h1>
<p>Abies hirtella, commonly known as the rough bark fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are short and covered in a fine layer of white wax. The tree's bark is thick and furrowed, giving it its common name, and it produces small, rounded cones that mature to release seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>The rough bark fir plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies hirtella is primarily native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States, particularly in California, Oregon, and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges. This species thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with subalpine and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Abies hirtella is also present in parts of northern Mexico, such as in the states of Baja California and Sonora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies hirtella was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool climates, typically in higher elevation regions.</p>
<p>It is often found in mountainous areas where it thrives in shaded, forested environments. This plant has been introduced to parts of North America, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
