<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream sides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are often hairy.</p>
<p>Adenophora morrisonensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora morrisonensis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age.

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora morrisonensis is primarily native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is found in specific regions of the island, particularly in mountainous areas with a temperate climate. This plant typically grows in open forests or grassy slopes at higher elevations. Its distribution is limited to certain ecological niches within Taiwan's diverse landscape.</p>
<p>Adenophora morrisonensis is an endemic species, meaning it is found nowhere else in the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora morrisonensis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full to partial sunlight. This plant is commonly found in the northern parts of its range, including regions in eastern Asia. Its introduction has been documented in several countries, particularly in China and parts of Korea.</p>
