                <h1>Acorus odoratus</h1>
<p>Acorus odoratus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial wetland plant native to Asia, Europe, and North America.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are often aromatic and have a distinctive, pleasant scent. The plant produces yellowish-green spadices, which are the flowering structures that contain both male and female parts. Acorus odoratus thrives in moist or aquatic environments, such as marshes and pond edges.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus odoratus has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern, typically ranging from 30 to 60 cm in length, with a bright green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, dark brown bark that grows from the base of the plant. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which bloom in early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-chambered berry that disperses its seeds through water, as the seeds are buoyant.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus odoratus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as India, China, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats, marshes, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. This plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments and is often associated with riparian zones. It is also present in parts of Africa, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Acorus odoratus is known for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus odoratus was mainly introduced to freshwater ecosystems, particularly in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow waters with muddy or sandy substrates. This plant is often found in regions with temperate climates and can tolerate a range of water conditions. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its rapid growth and potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in wetland restoration projects and ornamental gardening.</p>
