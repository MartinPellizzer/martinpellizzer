                    <h1>Atriplex lentiformis var. griffithsii</h1>
<p>Atriplex lentiformis var. griffithsii, commonly known as Griffiths' saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of salt-tolerant hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact clusters, which are followed by small, bead-like fruits. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils.</p>
