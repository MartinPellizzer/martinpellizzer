                <h1>Acinodendron marginatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron marginatum, commonly known as the marginated acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Acinodendron marginatum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron marginatum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron marginatum is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within lowland and hill forest regions. This plant is commonly found in secondary growth areas and along forest edges where it can receive partial sunlight. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the specific climatic and soil conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron marginatum was mainly introduced to new environments for its ornamental value and potential ecological benefits.</p>
<p>It has been found in regions with warm, humid climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. The plant's introduction has raised concerns due to its invasive potential in non-native habitats. It spreads primarily through seeds dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now expanding beyond its original range, prompting further study and management efforts.</p>
