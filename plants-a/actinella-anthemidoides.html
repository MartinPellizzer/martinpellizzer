                <h1>Actinella anthemidoides</h1>
<p>Actinella anthemidoides, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its compact rosette of silver-gray leaves and small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella anthemidoides has small, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella anthemidoides is primarily native to the Pacific Northwest region of North America, specifically Washington and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest environments, often growing on rocky or streamside substrates. This plant thrives in cool, humid climates and is typically associated with coniferous or mixed-evergreen forests. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions, making it a relatively rare and localized species.</p>
<p>Actinella anthemidoides is an important component of the understory flora in these forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella anthemidoides was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a horticultural ornamental due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas, establishing itself in natural environments. It is now considered a potential weed in certain regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Its distribution is mainly limited to the North Island, though it has been reported in some parts of the South Island as well.</p>
