<p>Aristida refracta, commonly known as the refracta grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Aristida refracta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
