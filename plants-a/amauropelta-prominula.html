                    <h1>Amauropelta prominula</h1>
<p>Amauropelta prominula, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common reproductive feature in ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species.</p>
