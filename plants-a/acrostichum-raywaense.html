<p>Acrostichum raywaense, commonly known as the Raywa fern, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acrostichum raywaense is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
