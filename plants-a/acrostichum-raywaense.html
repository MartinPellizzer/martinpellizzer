                <h1>Acrostichum raywaense</h1>
<p>Acrostichum raywaense, commonly known as the Raywa fern, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acrostichum raywaense is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum raywaense has large, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exhibits a slightly fibrous texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer, relying on wind pollination due to their lack of showy petals. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses its seeds by wind, allowing for wide distribution.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum raywaense is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly the island of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland forests and swampy areas where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant is adapted to the rich, organic soil conditions typical of these habitats. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is limited due to habitat destruction and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum raywaense was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and warm climates, typically near coastal regions or riverbanks.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments where there is consistent moisture and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and can rapidly colonize open areas, making it a common invasive species in certain regions. Its introduction has led to competition with native vegetation, affecting local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has spread to multiple countries in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific.</p>
