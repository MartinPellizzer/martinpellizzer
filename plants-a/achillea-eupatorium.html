                <h1>Achillea eupatorium</h1>
<p>Achillea eupatorium, commonly known as common yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pink or purple. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Achillea eupatorium is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat wounds and digestive issues.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea eupatorium has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and slightly reddish, growing in a branching pattern with a height of up to 1 meter. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in summer from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersing by wind after the seeds mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea eupatorium is a flowering plant native to Europe, particularly found in regions such as southern France, Italy, and parts of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>While it was historically distributed across these areas, its current range has been significantly reduced due to habitat loss and human activity. It thrives in open, sunny environments such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often growing at low altitudes up to around 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its declining population and restricted habitat, Achillea eupatorium is considered a threatened species, warranting conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea eupatorium is a hardy perennial that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring moderate watering to avoid root rot.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant grows through spring and summer, producing its characteristic pink to white flowers in late summer, and goes dormant in winter.</p>
<p>Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering promote dense growth and prevent legginess. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its ornamental value in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea eupatorium is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts beneficial insects and birds, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. It acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other native species to enhance soil health and promote a balanced garden ecosystem. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and habitat for small wildlife, playing a vital role in maintaining ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea eupatorium is a flowering plant known for its various uses and applications across different fields.</p>
