<p>Aspidium mohrioides, commonly known as the Mohri's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates in its habitat.</p>
<p>Aspidium mohrioides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality maintenance.</p>
