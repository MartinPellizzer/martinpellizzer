                <h1>Acosta steveniana</h1>
<p>Acosta steveniana, commonly known as the Steven's acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous environments. Its leaves are narrow and pinnately divided, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Acosta steveniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta steveniana has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a rough, reddish-brown bark, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta steveniana is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes within the Andes. This plant thrives in temperate to cold climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with alpine ecosystems and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Acosta steveniana is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta steveniana was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and well-drained soil. The plant is often found in regions where human activity has altered the natural landscape. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions beyond its native range.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
