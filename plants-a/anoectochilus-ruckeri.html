                    <h1>Anoectochilus ruckeri</h1>
<p>Anoectochilus ruckeri, commonly known as the Rucker's slipper orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its small, greenish-brown pseudobulbs and delicate, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Anoectochilus ruckeri is highly vulnerable and requires urgent conservation efforts.</p>
