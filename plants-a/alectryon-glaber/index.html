                            <h1>Alectryon Glaber</h1>
<p>Smooth alectryon, scientifically known as Alectryon glaber, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing the ecosystem. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is increasingly cultivated in gardens and landscapes. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a fascinating subject for botanists and plant lovers alike.</p>
