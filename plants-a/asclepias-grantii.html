                    <h1>Asclepias grantii</h1>
<p>Asclepias grantii, commonly known as the Grant's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Asclepias grantii plays a crucial role in supporting local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for monarch caterpillars.</p>
