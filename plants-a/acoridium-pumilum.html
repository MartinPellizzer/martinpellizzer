                <h1>Acoridium pumilum</h1>
<p>Acoridium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella plant, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acoraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling an umbrella shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium pumilum has small, linear leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, typically measuring around 2-4 cm in length and 0.5-1 cm in width, with a dark green color and a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a rough, grayish bark that remains relatively hidden beneath the dense foliage. It produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, pale green flowers that bloom during the spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium pumilum is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and limestone areas within these regions. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open woodlands and grasslands. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium pumilum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has established populations in regions with warm, humid climates that mimic its native environment. The plant's ability to thrive in disturbed soils has contributed to its spread in non-native areas. It is often found in gardens and along roadsides where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, Acoridium pumilum poses a potential threat to local ecosystems.</p>
