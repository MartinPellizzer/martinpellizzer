<p>Asplenium ruta-muraria subsp.</p>
<p>dolomiticum, commonly known as the Dolomitic Rock Fern, is a fern species native to limestone and dolomite regions. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lanceolate, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually unifoliate, with a single, elongated leaf blade that is often curled or twisted. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its preference for calcareous substrates and its unique leaf morphology adapted to its specific habitat.</p>
