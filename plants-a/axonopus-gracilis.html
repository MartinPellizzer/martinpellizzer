                    <h1>Axonopus gracilis</h1>
<p>Axonopus gracilis, commonly known as slender axonopus, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has fine, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, along trails, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed.</p>
