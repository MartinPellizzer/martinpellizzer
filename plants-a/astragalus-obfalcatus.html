                    <h1>Astragalus obfalcatus</h1>
<p>Astragalus obfalcatus, commonly known as the thick-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height and has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are often thick and waxy, which reduces water loss and aids in drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Astragalus obfalcatus is also known for its medicinal properties, with some species in the genus being used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
