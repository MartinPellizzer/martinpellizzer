<p>Apocynum syriacum, commonly known as the Syrian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its latex sap is milky and contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores.</p>
<p>Apocynum syriacum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>
