<p>Anabasis elatior, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10â€“30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Anabasis elatior is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in areas with minimal rainfall.</p>
