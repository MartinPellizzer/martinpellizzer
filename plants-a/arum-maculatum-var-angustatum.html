                    <h1>Arum maculatum var. angustatum</h1>
<p>Arum maculatum var. angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arum, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of the typical arum species. The plant produces a spatulate, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a showy, purple-bracted spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insect species.</p>
