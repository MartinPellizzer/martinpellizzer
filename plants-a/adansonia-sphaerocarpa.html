                <h1>Adansonia sphaerocarpa</h1>
<p>Adansonia sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the baobab tree, is a large, deciduous tree native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The tree produces large, white, fragrant flowers and has long, narrow leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains numerous seeds surrounded by a fibrous pulp.</p>
<p>The baobab is also known for its ecological and cultural significance in its native region.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adansonia sphaerocarpa has thick, trunk-like stems with smooth, greyish-white bark that is often fissured and flaky, growing in a single trunk with a short, narrow base.</p>
<p>Its leaves are large, compound, and palmately arranged, with elongated leaflets that are green and slightly hairy. The flowers are large, showy, and clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by bats. The fruit is a woody follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are extensive and deep, anchoring the plant and helping it survive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia sphaerocarpa is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the central and eastern regions of the island, particularly in dry forests and woodlands. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found at elevations ranging from 50 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its large, bulbous trunk and is a symbol of Madagascar's unique biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia sphaerocarpa was mainly introduced to regions with arid and semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, such as parts of southern Africa and Madagascar. This plant is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental species due to its unique appearance. It is also used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction to new areas has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its invasive potential.</p>
