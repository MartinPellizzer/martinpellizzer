                    <h1>Aechmea leucolepis</h1>
<p>Aechmea leucolepis, commonly known as the white-leaved bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers, which emerge from the center of the rosette, are usually pale pink or white and bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
