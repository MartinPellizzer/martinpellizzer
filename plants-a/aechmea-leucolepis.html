                <h1>Aechmea leucolepis</h1>
<p>Aechmea leucolepis, commonly known as the white-leaved bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers, which emerge from the center of the rosette, are usually pale pink or white and bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea leucolepis has leaves that are broad, strap-like, and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, erect stem with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows from the base of the rosette. Its flowers are clustered in a spike, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air, typical of epiphytic growth.</p>
