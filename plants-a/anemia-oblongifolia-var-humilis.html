                    <h1>Anemia oblongifolia var. humilis</h1>
<p>Anemia oblongifolia var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats, making it a suitable candidate for ground cover in shaded gardens.</p>
<p>The botanical interest of this species lies in its unique morphology and adaptability to humid, low-light conditions.</p>
