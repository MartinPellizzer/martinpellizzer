                    <h1>Alchemilla nitida</h1>
<p>Alchemilla nitida, commonly known as slender lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that resembles a mantle, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are followed by distinctive, papery bracts that remain on the plant throughout the growing season. Alchemilla nitida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form a compact, decorative ground cover.</p>
