                <h1>Achillea maritima subsp. atlantica</h1>
<p>Achillea maritima subsp.</p>
<p>atlantica, commonly known as Atlantic yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate strong winds, making it a hardy species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important plant for stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea maritima subsp.</p>
<p>atlantica has narrow, linear to lanceolate leaves that are basal and alternate, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture. The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-green color, growing in a clumping pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are composite, with yellow ray florets and brown disk florets, blooming from June to September, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in anchoring the plant in coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea maritima subsp.</p>
<p>atlantica is a coastal plant native to the western Mediterranean, particularly the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It is now found in parts of the eastern United States, especially along the Atlantic coast, where it has been introduced.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along dunes, cliffs, and rocky shores. It typically grows at low altitudes, often below 100 meters, in maritime climates with high salt exposure.</p>
<p>Currently, it is considered a non-native species in its introduced range and is not listed as endangered, though its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea maritima subsp.</p>
<p>atlantica is a hardy perennial known for its resilience and ornamental value. It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing established clumps, with the latter method ensuring faster growth. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, becoming active in spring and producing flowers in summer before going dormant in fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in early spring, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs, which can be managed with organic controls.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow enhances its beauty and benefits from shared pest resistance.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea maritima subsp.</p>
<p>atlantica is a hardy coastal plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant in coastal ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its deep root system that stabilizes sandy soils.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological benefits of coastal dunes by supporting a range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea maritima subsp.</p>
<p>atlantica is a hardy coastal plant known for its ornamental value and ecological importance in stabilizing sandy soils. While not commonly used in culinary applications, it has historical medicinal uses, particularly for treating wounds and skin conditions.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it valuable in horticulture and landscaping, especially in coastal regions. Culturally, it has symbolic associations with courage and healing, reminiscent of its mythological origins.</p>
<p>Economically, it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators, making it an important species in conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea maritima subsp.</p>
<p>atlantica has several popular cultivars, including 'Aurea' and 'Purpurascens', which are valued for their unique foliage and flowering characteristics. While natural hybrids between this subspecies and other *Achillea* species are rare, some horticultural hybrids have been developed to enhance traits such as color, hardiness, and bloom duration.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of horticultural importance due to its ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils, making it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant gardens. Its ornamental value and adaptability contribute to its popularity among gardeners seeking low-maintenance, resilient plants.</p>
<p>Overall, it plays a significant role in both ecological and aesthetic landscaping.</p>
