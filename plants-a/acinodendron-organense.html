<p>It is a type of lichen, which is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme environmental conditions. Its morphology includes a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces.</p>
