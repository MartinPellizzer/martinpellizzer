                    <h1>Arceuthobium mancinellae</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium mancinellae, commonly known as the parasitic sandwort, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically infecting species within the genus *Lycium*. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to its minimal foliage. Its life cycle involves a complex interaction with its host, where it can cause significant damage to the host's growth and survival.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
