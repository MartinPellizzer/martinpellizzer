                <h1>Adenocarpus telonensis</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus telonensis, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water retention.</p>
<p>Adenocarpus telonensis is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic to some animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus telonensis has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets that are green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, brownish bark that is slightly hairy, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in racemes, blooming during the wet season, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus telonensis is primarily native to France, Morocco, Portugal, and Spain.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the Mediterranean region, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland areas with mild, temperate climates. The species is often seen in open grasslands and along the edges of forests.</p>
<p>Its natural range reflects its adaptability to the diverse environmental conditions of these countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus telonensis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste areas, and degraded grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in parts of Africa, including South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is expanding as a result of human activity and climate change.</p>
