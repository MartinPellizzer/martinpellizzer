<p>Alisma lappula, commonly known as lesser waterplantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, pond edges, and along streams, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Alisma lappula is valued in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
