<p>Allium schoenoprasum subsp.</p>
<p>pumilum, commonly known as dwarf chives, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10â€“20 centimeters, with slender, grass-like leaves that emit a mild garlic or onion scent when crushed.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered white or pale purple flowers in the summer, which are followed by small, round bulbils that can be used for propagation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental and edible plant for gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a close relative of leeks and chives, with a distinct genetic lineage within the Allium genus.</p>
