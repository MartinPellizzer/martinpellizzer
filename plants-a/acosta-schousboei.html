                <h1>Acosta schousboei</h1>
<p>Acosta schousboei, commonly known as the Schousboei's acosta, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta schousboei has leaves that are elongated, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta schousboei is primarily native to the highland regions of southern Africa, specifically in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. This plant is adapted to the dry and temperate climates of these regions, where it grows in sparse vegetation. It is commonly seen in grasslands and rocky outcrops at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these localized areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta schousboei was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This plant has been reported in several states including Oregon and Washington. Its introduction is believed to be due to natural dispersal through wind or water.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study.</p>
