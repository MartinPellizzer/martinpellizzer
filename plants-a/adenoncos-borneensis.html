                <h1>Adenoncos borneensis</h1>
<p>Adenoncos borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean adenoncos, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Adenoncos borneensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoncos borneensis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and smooth, with a pale brown bark that becomes rougher with age, exhibiting a climbing growth pattern.

<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoncos borneensis is primarily native to the islands of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, specifically in Malaysia and Indonesia. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within lowland and hill dipterocarp forests. Its distribution is limited to specific regions in Kalimantan and Sarawak.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoncos borneensis was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, typically found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm climates with abundant sunlight and moderate rainfall. The plant is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Malaysia and Indonesia. Its introduction has been primarily due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
