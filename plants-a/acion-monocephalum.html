                <h1>Acion monocephalum</h1>
<p>Acion monocephalum, commonly known as the single-headed acion, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a rough texture.</p>
<p>Acion monocephalum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acion monocephalum has simple, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acion monocephalum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland forests and moist habitats. This plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing near rivers or in dense undergrowth. It is an important component of the local flora in these areas, contributing to biodiversity.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is limited and it is not widely cultivated outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acion monocephalum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant spreads through its rhizomes, making it difficult to control.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its ecological impact.</p>
