<p>Acosta boissieri, commonly known as the Mexican bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry environments, showcasing its adaptability to arid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching.</p>
<p>Acosta boissieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta boissieri has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 3 to 7 cm in length, and a dark green color on the upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
