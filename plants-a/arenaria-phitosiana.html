                    <h1>Arenaria phitosiana</h1>
<p>Arenaria phitosiana, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Arenaria phitosiana is well adapted to cold climates and is considered an indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
