<p>Alismorkis phajodes, commonly known as the broadleaf water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often emerging above the water surface. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Alismorkis phajodes plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
