                        <h1>Acacia iteaphylla var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia iteaphylla var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia iteaphylla var. latifolia is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>This variety is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. It thrives in open woodlands and shrublands, often growing along riverbanks and in coastal areas. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range, with its broad leaves helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the northern parts of the Australian continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia iteaphylla var. latifolia was mainly introduced to enhance biodiversity and provide habitat in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in rehabilitation projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh environmental conditions. This variety is valued for its fast growth and drought resistance, making it suitable for reforestation efforts. It has been introduced in several regions of Australia, including Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>However, its spread requires careful management to prevent potential ecological impacts.</p>
