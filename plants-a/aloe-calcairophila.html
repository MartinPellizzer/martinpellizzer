                    <h1>Aloe calcairophila</h1>
<p>Aloe calcairophila, commonly known as the Karoo aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late winter or early spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
