                <h1>Adelia neomexicana</h1>
<p>Adelia neomexicana, commonly known as New Mexico adelia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Adelia neomexicana is often found in rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia neomexicana has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and they grow in a shrub-like form. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in racemes, featuring four petals and numerous stamens, and they bloom in late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia neomexicana is primarily native to the southwestern United States, specifically New Mexico and parts of Arizona.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and desert margins. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on limestone or sandy substrates. It is well adapted to the region's hot, dry climate and can tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Adelia neomexicana is an important component of local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia neomexicana was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. It has been introduced to several states, including Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental needs and climate constraints.</p>
