<p>Aspidium lasiesthes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or muddy substrates.</p>
<p>Aspidium lasiesthes plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
