<p>Angraecum woodianum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white flowers with prominent, spurred petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific nocturnal moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p>
