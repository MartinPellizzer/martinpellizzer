<p>Astrophytum myriostigma var. tulense, commonly known as the Tulip Aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the rocky soils of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with tightly packed, fleshy, light green to blue-gray leaves that resemble tulip petals, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
