                <h1>Actinocephalus incanus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus incanus, commonly known as the hairy ant plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Actinocephalus incanus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus incanus has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, exhibiting a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is brown to reddish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus incanus is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy or rocky soils. This plant is often associated with shrublands and grasslands, thriving in environments with low rainfall. It is well adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent leaves and deep root system.</p>
<p>Despite its hardy nature, it is not widely cultivated outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus incanus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the exotic plant introductions during the 19th century. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
