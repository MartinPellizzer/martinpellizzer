                <h1>Adenostemma elatum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma elatum, commonly known as the hairy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in fine, hairy glands. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers arranged in clusters, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>Adenostemma elatum is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic to some animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma elatum has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stems are erect and branching, with a reddish-brown bark that is rough and fissured. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with pink to reddish petals, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma elatum is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and savanna habitats. The plant thrives in regions with a temperate to subtropical climate. It is often seen growing in open areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the African continent, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma elatum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, pastures, and open woodlands. This plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often considered an invasive species in some regions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenge for land managers.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for certain wildlife.</p>
