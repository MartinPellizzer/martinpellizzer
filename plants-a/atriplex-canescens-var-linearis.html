                    <h1>Atriplex canescens var. linearis</h1>
<p>Atriplex canescens var. linearis, commonly known as the linear saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often covered in a whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
