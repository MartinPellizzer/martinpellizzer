                <h1>Acronia quaternaria</h1>
<p>Acronia quaternaria, commonly known as the four-parted acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique quadrifoliate leaves, which consist of four leaflets arranged symmetrically around a central stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring and early summer. Acronia quaternaria thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species and is the subject of conservation efforts in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia quaternaria has leaves that are ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size of about 5-7 cm in length and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slightly ridged texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia quaternaria is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils along the shoreline, often in areas with mild temperatures and moderate precipitation. This plant is commonly found in dune ecosystems and is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats along the Pacific coastline.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia quaternaria was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Oregon in the early 2000s. The plant has since spread to parts of Washington and northern California. It thrives in moist, shaded environments along riverbanks and forested areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on native flora.</p>
