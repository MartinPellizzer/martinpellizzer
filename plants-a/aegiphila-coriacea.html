                <h1>Aegiphila coriacea</h1>
<p>Aegiphila coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf aegiphila, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Aegiphila coriacea is adapted to survive in harsh environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila coriacea has leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a rough, hairy texture and a grayish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a woody and often fissured bark that is dark brown to black in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with pale yellow petals and a tubular structure, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils in which the plant typically grows.</p>
