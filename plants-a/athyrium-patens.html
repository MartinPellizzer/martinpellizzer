<p>Athyrium patens, commonly known as the narrowleaf fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori.</p>
