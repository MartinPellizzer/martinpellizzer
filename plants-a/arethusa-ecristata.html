<p>Arethusa ecristata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are slender and elongated, with a reddish hue, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>Arethusa ecristata is a low-growing plant that plays an important ecological role in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
