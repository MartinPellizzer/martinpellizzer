<p>Alexitoxicon intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate poison ivy.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>While it is not as toxic as true poison ivy, it can still cause mild skin irritation in some individuals.</p>
