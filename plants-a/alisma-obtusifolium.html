                    <h1>Alisma obtusifolium</h1>
<p>Alisma obtusifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense spikes and bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Alisma obtusifolium plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
