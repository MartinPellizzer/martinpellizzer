<p>Aristida jerichoensis var. subspinulifera, commonly known as the Jericho grass variant, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
