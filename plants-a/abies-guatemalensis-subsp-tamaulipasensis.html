<p>Abies guatemalensis subsp.</p>
<p>tamaulipasensis, commonly known as the Tamaulipan fir, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the northeastern regions of Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>The cones are typically pendulous and contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
