                <h1>Adiantum mexiae</h1>
<p>Adiantum mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive veining pattern.</p>
<p>Adiantum mexiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum mexiae has feather-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, bright green color and a slender, upright arrangement.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, and have a finely serrated margin. The plant has a slender, wiry stem that is smooth and pale green, with a growth pattern that is mostly creeping along the ground.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-yellow in color, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum mexiae is primarily native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with humid climates and shaded environments. This fern thrives in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Veracruz in Mexico. It is often associated with limestone soils and can be found in cloud forests and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Adiantum mexiae is well adapted to moist, shaded habitats and is a characteristic species of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum mexiae was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the United States and Canada, as a decorative plant due to its delicate and attractive fronds.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as gardens, rockeries, and woodland areas. The plant has been cultivated for its ornamental value and is often used in horticultural settings. Despite its introduction, it has not become invasive in most regions where it is grown.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to areas with suitable humidity and temperature conditions.</p>
