<p>Aegilops lorentii subsp.</p>
<p>pontica, commonly known as the Pontic wild rye, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are typically borne in clusters along the stem, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for improving wheat genetic diversity.</p>
