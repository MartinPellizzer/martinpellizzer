<p>Atriplex velutinella subsp.</p>
<p>levibracteata, commonly known as the silky saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically in summer. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its succulent leaves and ability to store water contribute to its resilience in dry conditions.</p>
