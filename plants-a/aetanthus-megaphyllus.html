                    <h1>Aetanthus megaphyllus</h1>
<p>Aetanthus megaphyllus, commonly known as the giant leaf euphorbia, is a striking plant characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>Native to the arid regions of southern Africa, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-green flowers during the summer months, which are followed by distinctive, spiny seed capsules. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and botanical gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to overwatering, it requires careful cultivation to ensure its survival.</p>
