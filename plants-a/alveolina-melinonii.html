                    <h1>Alveolina melinonii</h1>
<p>Alveolina melinonii, commonly known as the African sand dollar, is a species of bryophyte found in arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Diphysciaceae and is characterized by its small, cushion-like growth form. The plant has a dense network of rhizoids that help anchor it to the substrate and absorb moisture from the environment. Its leaves are scale-like and often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Alveolina melinonii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions.</p>
