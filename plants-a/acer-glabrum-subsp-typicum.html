                <h1>Acer glabrum subsp. typicum</h1>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>typicum, commonly known as the white maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>typicum has simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside; the leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm in length and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The stem is smooth and slender, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>typicum is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, specifically found in parts of Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Its current distribution has been somewhat restricted due to habitat loss, though it can still be found in scattered populations within its former range.</p>
<p>This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands and along streambanks, often in partial to full shade. It typically grows at elevations between 300 and 1,200 meters. The conservation status of Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>typicum is listed as vulnerable due to its limited distribution and habitat degradation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>typicum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or garlic can help deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>typicum is a native deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers and serves as a valuable food source for herbivores.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a healthy understory. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>
