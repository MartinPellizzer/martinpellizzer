<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an herb or shrub, with opposite leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive scent. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in cymes, and its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Adenostemma biflorum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma biflorum has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and vary in size from 2 to 8 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with fine hairs, and has a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in pairs, and have a tubular structure with five lobes, typically appearing in shades of pink or purple during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>
