                <h1>Adenostemma biflorum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered adenostemma, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect or spreading growth habit. The plant typically features opposite leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with hairy surfaces. Its showy, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches.</p>
<p>Adenostemma biflorum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats including grasslands and woodland edges.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma biflorum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 2â€“5 cm in length with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered with fine hairs, displaying a pale green to brownish color, and grows in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with tubular corollas that are pink to red in color, blooming from summer to fall, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma biflorum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. This plant thrives in humid, subtropical climates and is often associated with coastal and inland wetlands. It is also present in parts of Texas and the Caribbean, where similar environmental conditions exist.</p>
<p>Adenostemma biflorum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma biflorum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along waterways.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm climates with full sun exposure and is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. This plant is known for its ability to spread rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is often found in both natural and anthropogenic landscapes.</p>
