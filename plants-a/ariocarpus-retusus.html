                    <h1>Ariocarpus retusus</h1>
<p>Ariocarpus retusus, commonly known as the "Cactus of the Gods," is a rare and striking succulent native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stems covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring, which are pollinated by nocturnal insects. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat destruction, it is listed as endangered.</p>
