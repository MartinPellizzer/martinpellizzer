                    <h1>Acacia floydii</h1>
<p>Acacia floydii, commonly known as the Floyd's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Acacia floydii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for native wildlife.</p>
