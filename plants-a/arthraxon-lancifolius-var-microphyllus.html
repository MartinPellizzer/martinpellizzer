                    <h1>Arthraxon lancifolius var. microphyllus</h1>
<p>Arthraxon lancifolius var. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved arrowgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a pointed tip. The leaves are typically smaller than those of the typical variety, hence the varietal name "microphyllus.". It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
