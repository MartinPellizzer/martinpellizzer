                    <h1>Agave bromeliifolia</h1>
<p>Agave bromeliifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of stiff, narrow, blue-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces an inflorescence of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure makes it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
