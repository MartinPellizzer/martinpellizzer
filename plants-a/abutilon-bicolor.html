                <h1>Abutilon bicolor</h1>
<p>Abutilon bicolor, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of orange-red bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are often mistaken for flowers. These bracts are actually modified leaves, and the true flowers are small and inconspicuous.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant, showy appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon bicolor has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically hairy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are pendulous, with a spathelike bract and a showy, pale yellow to orange corolla, blooming in summer and attracting insects for pollination. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon bicolor is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Paraguay.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it is now found in various parts of the world, including tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, Africa, and Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forest understories, along riverbanks, and in disturbed habitats. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its distribution has been affected by habitat loss and overharvesting in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon bicolor is a flowering plant known for its vibrant, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy leaves, often grown as an ornamental in gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has an annual growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and producing fruit in late summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
