                        <h1>Acanthophyllum kurdicum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum kurdicum, commonly known as the Kurdish thornbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, often inconspicuous flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically small and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum kurdicum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthophyllum kurdicum is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and parts of the Caucasus. This plant thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often in desert or steppe environments. It is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with specific ecological zones that provide the necessary conditions for its survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthophyllum kurdicum was mainly introduced to areas with arid and semi-arid climates, particularly in regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert margins and dry steppe environments. This plant is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Its introduction has been noted in parts of Turkey, Iraq, and Iran, where it has established itself in natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for soil stabilization and as a component of local vegetation in these regions.</p>
