                    <h1>Acanthophyllum kurdicum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum kurdicum, commonly known as the Kurdish thornbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, often inconspicuous flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically small and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum kurdicum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
