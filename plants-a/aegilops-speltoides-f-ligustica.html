                    <h1>Aegilops speltoides f. ligustica</h1>
<p>Aegilops speltoides f. ligustica, commonly known as the Ligurian speltgrass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, pointed leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. It possesses a diploid genome and is closely related to cultivated wheat species, making it a valuable genetic resource for breeding programs.</p>
<p>Due to its potential for improving wheat resilience to environmental stresses, it is of interest in agricultural research.</p>
