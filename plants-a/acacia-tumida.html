                    <h1>Acacia tumida</h1>
<p>Acacia tumida, commonly known as the woolly acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, pale green foliage and distinctive, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisine. Its thick, waxy leaves help it conserve water, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia tumida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
