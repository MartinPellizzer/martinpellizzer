                <h1>Adenocalymma sastrei</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma sastrei, commonly known as the Sastre's adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically ovate with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma sastrei is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma sastrei has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and a yellow center, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma sastrei is primarily native to Colombia.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the western and central areas. This plant thrives in humid, lowland environments with rich soil. It is commonly observed in the Andean foothills and coastal regions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely tied to the specific ecological conditions of Colombia's diverse landscapes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma sastrei was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. This plant is adapted to saline and windy conditions, making it a common species in coastal habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native vegetation.</p>
