                        <h1>Acacia longifolia f. sophorae</h1>
<p>Acacia longifolia f. sophorae, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Acacia, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. It is adapted to arid and coastal environments, showcasing drought tolerance and salt resistance.</p>
<p>This form is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia longifolia f. sophorae is primarily native to southern Australia, including the states of Western Australia, South Australia, and Victoria.</p>
<p>This subspecies is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, particularly in regions with a Mediterranean climate. It thrives in dry, well-drained environments and is often associated with heathlands and coastal dunes. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and can tolerate salt spray and sandy conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia longifolia f. sophorae was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and for ornamental purposes in coastal and sandy areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as southern California, Oregon, and parts of the Pacific Northwest. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for dune stabilization and landscape planting. However, it has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to its classification as a noxious weed in several states.</p>
