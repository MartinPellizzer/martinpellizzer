                <h1>Abelmoschus manihot subsp. manihot</h1>
<p>Abelmoschus manihot subsp.</p>
<p>manihot, commonly known as cassava, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers and round, woody fruits that contain edible starchy roots. Cassava is a staple crop in many tropical regions due to its high yield and nutritional value.</p>
<p>Its roots are rich in carbohydrates but require processing to remove toxic compounds before consumption.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus manihot subsp.</p>
<p>manihot has large, heart-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring up to 20 cm in length. The stem is cylindrical, rough to the touch, and has a greenish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, growing upright with a branching pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow with five petals, appearing in clusters, and bloom from summer to autumn, being pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus manihot subsp.</p>
<p>manihot is a tropical plant native to Africa, particularly found in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Its current distribution extends to parts of Asia, including India and Southeast Asia, where it is cultivated for its starchy roots.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil, typically in lowland areas. This species is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is threatened by deforestation and agricultural expansion, leading to concerns about its long-term conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus manihot subsp.</p>
<p>manihot is a tropical plant known for its starchy roots and adaptability to various climates. It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle spans about 6 to 8 months, with rapid vegetative growth followed by flowering and fruiting.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil with consistent watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Regular fertilization with a balanced NPK mix and pruning to remove diseased or overcrowded branches promote healthy growth. Common pests include aphids and armyworms, while root rot can occur in poorly drained soils.</p>
<p>Companion planting with legumes or marigolds can help deter pests and improve soil fertility.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus manihot subsp.</p>
<p>manihot is a versatile plant that provides food for both humans and animals, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for its reproductive cycle and the health of the surrounding ecosystem.</p>
<p>The plant also acts as a nitrogen fixer, improving soil fertility and supporting the growth of neighboring plants. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves as shelter and habitat for various small wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus manihot subsp.</p>
<p>manihot is a versatile plant with significant uses across various domains. In culinary applications, its starchy roots are a staple food in many African countries, used to make dishes like fufu and gari.</p>
<p>Medicinally, it has been utilized for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Industrially, it serves as a source of renewable energy and biofuels, contributing to economic development in rural areas.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic value in some communities, representing sustenance and resilience.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus manihot subsp.</p>
<p>manihot has a variety of cultivars and hybrids that are widely cultivated for their edible roots. Popular cultivars include 'Kongolese' and 'Tanzanian', known for their high yields and improved flavor.</p>
<p>Hybrids have been developed to enhance traits such as disease resistance and drought tolerance. These varieties play a significant role in horticultural systems, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Their importance lies in their contribution to food security and nutritional value in many developing countries.</p>
