                        <h1>Abelmoschus manihot subsp. manihot</h1>
<p>Abelmoschus manihot subsp.</p>
<p>manihot, commonly known as cassava, is a tropical plant native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical regions. It is a herbaceous perennial shrub that produces large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant's most economically important part is its swollen root, which is rich in starch and used as a food source. Cassava is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a staple crop in many developing countries.</p>
<p>However, it contains cyanogenic glycosides, which can release toxic hydrogen cyanide if not properly processed.</p>
