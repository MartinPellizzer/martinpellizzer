                <h1>Acnistus confertiflorus</h1>
<p>Acnistus confertiflorus, commonly known as the clustered milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature in the milkweed family.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus confertiflorus has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter in color underneath, with a moderate size and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that has a slightly rough texture, and it grows in a sprawling or climbing manner. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus confertiflorus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in woodland areas, shrublands, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in moist to moderately dry conditions and is often part of the understory vegetation. It is also known to occur in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Acnistus confertiflorus is well adapted to warm climates and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus confertiflorus was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers.</p>
<p>It was originally native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plant has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation contribute to its invasiveness.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native biodiversity.</p>
