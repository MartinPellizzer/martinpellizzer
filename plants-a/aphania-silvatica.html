                    <h1>Aphania silvatica</h1>
<p>Aphania silvatica, commonly known as the forest aphania, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on rocky outcrops. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to survive in challenging conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Aphania silvatica is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
