                <h1>Acuan fendleri</h1>
<p>Acuan fendleri, commonly known as the Fendler's acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant has slender, woody stems and bipinnate leaves that are adapted to conserve water. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in dense clusters.</p>
<p>Acuan fendleri is well-suited to harsh environments and is often found in rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acuan fendleri has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, woody, and covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels off in flakes as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a greenish center, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan fendleri is primarily native to the arid regions of northern Chile and southwestern Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Atacama Desert and surrounding areas, where it thrives in harsh, dry conditions. This plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and on slopes. It is part of the Apiaceae family and is known for its distinctive white flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan fendleri was mainly introduced to specific regions in Australia, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, often growing in disturbed or open habitats. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in saline and coastal environments, making it a notable species in these ecosystems. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several ecological zones, though it is not considered invasive.</p>
<p>This distribution highlights its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
