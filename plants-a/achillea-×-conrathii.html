<p>Achillea × conrathii, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (meadow yarrow), resulting in a plant with distinctive, finely divided, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces flat-topped clusters of small, bright yellow to reddish-orange flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It is typically found in open, sunny areas such as meadows and grasslands, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × conrathii has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a silvery-gray underside and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a greenish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cypsela, with pappus hairs that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × conrathii is a hybrid plant native to southern Europe, particularly in regions of Spain and Portugal.</p>
