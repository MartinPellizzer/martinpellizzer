                <h1>Achillea albinea</h1>
<p>Achillea albinea, commonly known as white yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea albinea has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a gray-green color and a woolly texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to brownish bark. Its flowers are flat-topped clusters of small, white to pale yellow petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea albinea is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that includes areas such as Spain, Portugal, and southern France, as well as some regions in the Middle East. This species thrives in dry, rocky, or gravelly soils and is commonly found in open habitats like slopes, scrublands, and wastelands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea albinea is considered to be of conservation concern in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea albinea is a hardy perennial plant known for its silvery-gray foliage and delicate white flowers, often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seeds sown in late summer, with cuttings also being a viable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a relatively short growth cycle, blooming in the summer months and going dormant in the winter, making it ideal for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, though it benefits from occasional deep watering during dry spells. Fertilization should be light, applied in early spring, while pruning dead flowers after blooming helps maintain its shape and encourages new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in overly humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, rosemary, or thyme enhances its aesthetic appeal and provides natural pest repellent benefits.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea albinea is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering food sources and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its dense foliage. It also serves as a natural erosion control plant due to its deep root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea albinea contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea albinea is a flowering plant known for its potential medicinal uses, including its traditional application in treating skin conditions and as an antiseptic.</p>
<p>It has been used in herbal medicine to address inflammation and digestive issues. While not widely cultivated for culinary purposes, it may be used in certain regional cuisines for its mild flavor. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and healing, often appearing in folklore and traditional practices.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea albinea has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Avalanche' and 'Snowdrift,' known for their dense, fluffy white flowers and compact growth habit. Hybrids of Achillea albinea often combine traits from related species, such as extended blooming periods and improved disease resistance. These plants are highly valued in horticulture for their ability to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Their use in gardens and landscapes highlights their importance as low-maintenance, drought-tolerant perennials.</p>
