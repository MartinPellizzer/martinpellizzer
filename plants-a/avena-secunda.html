                    <h1>Avena secunda</h1>
<p>Avena secunda, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescence. The plant produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated, a common feature among grasses. Its seeds are enclosed in a lemma and palea, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>Avena secunda is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
