<p>Arenaria peploides, commonly known as sandpink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage that help stabilize sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Arenaria peploides is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments.</p>
