<p>Arundinaria macclureana, commonly known as the MacClure's bamboo, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential weed.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to other bamboo-like grasses.</p>
