                <h1>Actinoschoenus pentagonus</h1>
<p>Actinoschoenus pentagonus, commonly known as the pentagonal starwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Actinoschoenus pentagonus is often found in moist, grassy areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinoschoenus pentagonus has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a waxy surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright with some branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor and spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoschoenus pentagonus is primarily native to the eastern and southeastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and parts of Alabama.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland environments, particularly in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of freshwater lakes and rivers. This plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often associated with areas that experience seasonal flooding. It is also present in some regions of Mexico and the Caribbean, where similar wetland habitats exist.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific environmental conditions, its distribution is relatively limited compared to more widespread wetland species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoschoenus pentagonus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, star-shaped flowers. However, it has since become a weed in some areas, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in moist environments and can spread rapidly in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
