<p>Acacia visneoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves that are composed of numerous small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia visneoides is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in degraded landscapes.</p>
