<p>Allium dentigerum, commonly known as the tooth garlic, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem bearing a single, spherical umbel of white to pale purple flowers. Its bulbous structure is similar to other alliums, but it is distinguished by its finely toothed leaf margins.</p>
<p>Allium dentigerum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a mild garlic-like scent.</p>
