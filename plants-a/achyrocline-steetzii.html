                <h1>Achyrocline steetzii</h1>
<p>Achyrocline steetzii, commonly known as the Hawaiian false geranium, is a flowering plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline steetzii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 2â€“5 cm in length with a dull green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, displaying a pale blue to violet color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline steetzii is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America, such as Mexico and the northern regions of South America. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical environments, often in coastal areas or near mangroves. It is commonly associated with sandy or limestone soils and thrives in humid climates.</p>
<p>Its natural range is limited to these specific regions, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline steetzii was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along shorelines and in open, sunny habitats. The plant is often spread through human activities, such as construction and landscaping. It has become an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is expanding in regions with warm climates and low rainfall.</p>
