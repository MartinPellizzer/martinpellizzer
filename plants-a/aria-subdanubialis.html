                <h1>Aria subdanubialis</h1>
<p>Aria subdanubialis, commonly known as the Danube arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its habitat.</p>
<p>Aria subdanubialis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
