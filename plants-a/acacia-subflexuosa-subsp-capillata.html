                        <h1>Acacia subflexuosa subsp. capillata</h1>
<p>Acacia subflexuosa subsp.</p>
<p>capillata, commonly known as the silky wattle, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and delicate, feathery leaves that give it a soft, silky appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
