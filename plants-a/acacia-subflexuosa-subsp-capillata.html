                <h1>Acacia subflexuosa subsp. capillata</h1>
<p>Acacia subflexuosa subsp.</p>
<p>capillata, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like phyllodes that are typically reddish or brownish in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Acacia subflexuosa subsp.</p>
<p>capillata is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia subflexuosa subsp.</p>
<p>capillata has narrow, feathery leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a silvery-green color and a soft, fuzzy texture. The stems are woody, with a pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and they exhibit a sprawling growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow, clustered in cylindrical spikes, and bloom from late winter to early spring, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, ellipsoid seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to access water in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia subflexuosa subsp.</p>
<p>capillata is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola. Its current distribution includes parts of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>This species is typically found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along riverbanks, often in areas with low rainfall. It grows at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia subflexuosa subsp.</p>
<p>capillata is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to Australia, known for its feathery foliage and yellow flowers. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a period of cold stratification for germination.</p>
<p>This plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil, and it requires minimal watering once established. Fertilization should be done sparingly with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season, while pruning is recommended to maintain shape and encourage flowering.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, and it pairs well with native grasses and flowering plants in a garden setting.</p>
