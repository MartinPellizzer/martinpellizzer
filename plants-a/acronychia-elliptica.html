                <h1>Acronychia elliptica</h1>
<p>Acronychia elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf apple or white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It features smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and typically narrow. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by round, woody fruits containing a single seed.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia elliptica has simple, elliptic-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically greyish-brown in color. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in inflorescences, and are pollinated by insects, blooming during the wet season. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia elliptica is primarily native to the northern regions of Australia, specifically Queensland and northern New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland rainforests. The plant thrives in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with riverine and coastal vegetation.</p>
<p>Acronychia elliptica is an important component of the understory flora in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia elliptica was mainly introduced to coastal and lowland areas of eastern Australia, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils near the coast, often in heathlands and open forests. This plant is adapted to salty and windy conditions, making it a resilient species in coastal environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
