<p>Asplenium ceterach subsp.</p>
<p>bivalens, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green, and often leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright clump.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
