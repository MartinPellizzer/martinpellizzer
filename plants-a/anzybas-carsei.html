<p>Anzybas carsei, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Anzybas carsei plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
