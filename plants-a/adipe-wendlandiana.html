                <h1>Adipe wendlandiana</h1>
<p>Adipe wendlandiana, commonly known as the Wendland's adenophora, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adipe wendlandiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adipe wendlandiana has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The stem is upright and woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in early summer and relying on insect pollination.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipe wendlandiana is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. This plant is commonly found in the coastal regions of Florida, particularly in the Tampa Bay area and the Florida Keys. It is well adapted to the humid, subtropical climate and can tolerate occasional flooding.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role, it is an important component of the local wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipe wendlandiana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, waxy leaves and unique growth habit. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses as a decorative species. It has been reported to naturalize in some areas, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to other introduced species in the region.</p>
