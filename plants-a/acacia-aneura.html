<p>Acacia aneura, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and grayish bark that peels in thin layers. The plant has bipinnate leaves, which are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. Its flowers are yellow and occur in dense, globular clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>Acacia aneura is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
