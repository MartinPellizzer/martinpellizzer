                <h1>Acronychia emarginata</h1>
<p>Acronychia emarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acronychia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often slightly serrated along the edges. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or yellow-green in color, followed by woody, spherical fruits. Its bark is smooth and pale, with a distinctive flaky texture, and it is often found in coastal and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Acronychia emarginata is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses by Indigenous communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia emarginata has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually grey to brown in color, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have yellowish-white petals; they bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody drupe, containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, helping it to withstand coastal conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia emarginata is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in the eastern and western regions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soils. Acronychia emarginata is commonly seen in lowland and hill forest areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the unique ecological conditions of New Guinea's biodiversity hotspots.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia emarginata was mainly introduced to urban and suburban areas for ornamental purposes due to its attractive, glossy leaves.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is considered an invasive species in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal. Its introduction has led to competition with native flora in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread into natural habitats.</p>
