                    <h1>Aegilops squarrosa var. truncata</h1>
<p>Aegilops squarrosa var. truncata, commonly known as the truncated wild oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bear bristle-like awns, which are distinctive features of the genus Aegilops. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
