                <h1>Adnaria salicifolia</h1>
<p>Adnaria salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, willow-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near water bodies.</p>
<p>Adnaria salicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria salicifolia has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in terminal panicles, blooming in spring and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria salicifolia is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas and rocky soils, often found along the shores of countries such as Italy, Greece, and Turkey. This plant is well adapted to the warm, dry climate typical of these regions. It is commonly seen in areas with mild winters and hot, sunny summers.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to its ability to tolerate salt spray and poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria salicifolia was mainly introduced to new habitats in regions with moist, temperate climates, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It has been observed spreading beyond its original cultivation sites, establishing itself in natural areas where it competes with native vegetation. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils contribute to its invasive potential in certain ecosystems. It is particularly common in wetlands and along stream banks, where it can alter local hydrology and reduce biodiversity.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
