                <h1>Acridocarpus taitensis</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus taitensis, commonly known as the Taiti sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Pacific islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, oily wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces dark, spherical berries.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus taitensis has leaves that are simple, elliptical in shape, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus taitensis is primarily native to Kenya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions and lowland areas of the country. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is an important component of the local flora and is sometimes used in traditional practices.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones within Kenya.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus taitensis was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is often found in coastal areas and along stream banks, where it forms dense thickets. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems, as it can outcompete local flora.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it remains a popular choice for gardeners seeking a striking, low-maintenance plant.</p>
