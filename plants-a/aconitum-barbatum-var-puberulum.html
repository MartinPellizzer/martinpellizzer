                    <h1>Aconitum barbatum var. puberulum</h1>
<p>Aconitum barbatum var. puberulum, commonly known as the pubescent monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to violet flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves with a hairy texture, contributing to its pubescent appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens.</p>
