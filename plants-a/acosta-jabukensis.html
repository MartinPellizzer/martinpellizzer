                <h1>Acosta jabukensis</h1>
<p>Acosta jabukensis, commonly known as the golden star vine, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble stars, which bloom in clusters along its climbing stems. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and is often found growing in humid, shaded environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Acosta jabukensis plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta jabukensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark that is grayish-brown and tends to flake off in strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by animals feeding on the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta jabukensis is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in rainforests and along riverbanks, where it benefits from high humidity and indirect sunlight. Acosta jabukensis is often associated with secondary growth forests and is known for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its native range has been significantly reduced in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta jabukensis was mainly introduced to new environments for its ornamental value and potential ecological benefits.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with warm climates and well-drained soils. The plant has been introduced to several countries in South America, particularly in areas with similar ecological conditions to its native habitat. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, careful monitoring is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
