<p>Alyssum tortuosum subsp.</p>
<p>cretaceum, commonly known as the Cretaceous alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink.</p>
<p>The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It typically blooms in spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
