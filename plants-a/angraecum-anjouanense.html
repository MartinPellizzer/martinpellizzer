<p>Angraecum anjouanense, commonly known as the Anjouan star orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Comoros Islands.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with tall, erect stems and large, showy white flowers that are adorned with intricate purple and green markings. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, which bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators such as hawkmoths. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor volcanic soil of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Angraecum anjouanense is highly valued for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its restricted range.</p>
