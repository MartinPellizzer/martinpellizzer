<p>Aphanes neglecta, commonly known as the common sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its fruits are small, dry achenes that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across sandy or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Aphanes neglecta is often found in open habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and coastal areas.</p>
