                    <h1>Arenaria buxifolia</h1>
<p>Arenaria buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wool. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in alpine gardens or as a ground cover in harsh environments.</p>
