<p>Alchemilla argyrophylla f. emarginata, commonly known as silverleaf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are silver-white on the underside, with a distinctive wavy or notched margin, giving it its botanical name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and ability to tolerate wet conditions.</p>
