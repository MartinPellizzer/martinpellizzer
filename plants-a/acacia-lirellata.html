                        <h1>Acacia lirellata</h1>
<p>Acacia lirellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and yellow flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>Acacia lirellata is often used in reforestation and soil stabilization due to its hardy nature.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia lirellata belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their ancient lineage and specialized structures. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by their diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have compound leaves and flowers with a specific arrangement of parts. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pods as fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive umbrella-shaped flower heads and often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia lirellata, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions, known for its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia lirellata is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the region's coastal and inland areas, particularly in sandy soils. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Acacia lirellata plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various native animals.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia lirellata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of ecological restoration efforts and for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It was introduced in the late 19th century and has since become naturalized in various regions across the country. The plant is now considered a potential weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is tolerant of both drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, its spread has raised concerns among land managers due to its invasive potential.</p>
