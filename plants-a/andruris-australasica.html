                <h1>Andruris australasica</h1>
<p>Andruris australasica, commonly known as the Australian sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, leathery leaves and small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Its wood is highly valued for its fragrant properties and has been traditionally used by Indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species.</p>
