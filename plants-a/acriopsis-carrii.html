                <h1>Acriopsis carrii</h1>
<p>Acriopsis carrii, commonly known as the Carri's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a rosette of basal leaves that are spiny and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Acriopsis carrii is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acriopsis carrii has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are typically green and have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis carrii is primarily native to Malaya.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical regions of the Malay Peninsula. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within primary and secondary forests. Acriopsis carrii is commonly associated with limestone substrates in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Malaya.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis carrii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils. This plant is particularly common in the western United States, including states like California, Nevada, and Utah. It is often found in association with other invasive species, which may contribute to its spread.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a significant component of the flora in these disturbed ecosystems.</p>
