                            <h1>Astragalus Declinatus Subsp. Pinetorum</h1>
<p>Pine mountain milkvetch, scientifically known as Astragalus declinatus subsp. pinetorum, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. This subspecies is characterized by its delicate pink to purple flowers and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. Found primarily in pine forest ecosystems, it plays a vital role in supporting local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it faces significant threats to its survival. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique and ecologically important species.</p>
