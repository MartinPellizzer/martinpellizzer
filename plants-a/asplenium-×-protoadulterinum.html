                    <h1>Asplenium × protoadulterinum</h1>
<p>Asplenium × protoadulterinum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, dark green fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival.</p>
