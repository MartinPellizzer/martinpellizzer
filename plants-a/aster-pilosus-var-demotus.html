                    <h1>Aster pilosus var. demotus</h1>
<p>Aster pilosus var. demotus, commonly known as the short-hair aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features erect, hairy stems that are typically less than 30 cm in height, adorned with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads in the late summer and early fall, which are surrounded by a series of yellowish to brownish bracts. Its hairy foliage and compact growth habit make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other aster species and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
