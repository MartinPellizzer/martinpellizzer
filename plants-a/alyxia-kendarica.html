                    <h1>Alyxia kendarica</h1>
<p>Alyxia kendarica, commonly known as the Kendaric mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing some photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Alyxia kendarica is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
