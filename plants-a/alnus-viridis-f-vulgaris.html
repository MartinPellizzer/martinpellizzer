                    <h1>Alnus viridis f. vulgaris</h1>
<p>Alnus viridis f. vulgaris, commonly known as the common alder, is a deciduous tree native to northern regions of the Americas and Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and catkin-like flowers, which are typical of the Betulaceae family. The tree has a shallow root system that forms associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams and wetlands.</p>
<p>The bark is typically gray to reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age.</p>
