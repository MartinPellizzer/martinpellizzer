                <h1>Acer pseudoplatanus var. subobtusum</h1>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. subobtusum, commonly known as the rounded-leaved maple, is a variant of the common maple, characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are often more lobed than those of the typical species.</p>
<p>This plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The leaves are typically a vibrant green during the growing season and turn striking shades of red and orange in autumn. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>The rounded-leaved maple is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. subobtusum has palmate leaves that are typically 5â€“7 lobed, with a broad, rounded shape, alternate arrangement, and a dark green upper surface that turns red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters during late spring, with separate male and female flowers, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule, which is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. subobtusum is a rare variant of the European maple, native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Apennines. It thrives in moist, temperate climates, typically found in shaded, forested areas. This species grows at elevations between 800 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. subobtusum is a striking variant of the maple tree known for its unique foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings offering a more reliable method for preserving varietal traits. The growth cycle involves a period of rapid growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter, making it suitable for temperate climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires consistent watering during dry periods without becoming waterlogged. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended for optimal health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like scale insects or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs like lavender or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. subobtusum is a valuable component of forest ecosystems, providing food and shelter for a variety of wildlife.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its seeds are consumed by birds and small mammals. The plant acts as a companion species, supporting biodiversity by creating microhabitats for other flora and fauna. It also contributes to erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil in forested areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it enhances the overall ecological balance by improving soil structure and supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. subobtusum is a rare variant of the maple tree known primarily for its ornamental value in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have limited use in traditional herbal remedies. Industrially, it contributes to the timber and paper industries, though its economic impact is minimal compared to more common maple species. Culturally, it is valued as a symbol of natural beauty and biodiversity in regions where it is cultivated.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems also supports local wildlife, enhancing its importance in conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. subobtusum has a range of popular cultivars such as 'Columnare' and 'Sutherlandii', which are prized for their unique foliage and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also a parent species in several hybrids, including the widely cultivated Acer x carpinifolium, which combines the ornamental traits of maples with the hardiness of horse chestnut. These varieties and hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions. Their use in landscaping and as ornamental trees contributes significantly to the diversity of maple collections worldwide.</p>
<p>The species plays an important role in both traditional and modern horticultural practices.</p>
