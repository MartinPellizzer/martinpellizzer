                    <h1>Acer pseudoplatanus var. subobtusum</h1>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. subobtusum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maple, is a variant of the common maple native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, serrated leaves that are narrower than those of the typical species, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for cultivation in gardens and parks.</p>
