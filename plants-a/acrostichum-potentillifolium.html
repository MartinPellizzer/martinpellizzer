                <h1>Acrostichum potentillifolium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum potentillifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum potentillifolium has narrow, feather-like leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and vary in size from 10 to 30 cm in length, with a bright green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a clump-forming pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind after maturity.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and establish itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum potentillifolium is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of swamps where the soil is consistently moist. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with coastal and freshwater habitats. It is an important component of the wetland ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum potentillifolium was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in wetland areas. This plant has been reported in Oregon, Washington, and parts of California. Its introduction is likely due to human activities such as landscaping and land development.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species and may have limited ecological impact in its new environment.</p>
