<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish flowers that are often surrounded by colorful bracts, giving it a showy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some tropical gardens for its vibrant foliage and unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha mogotensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, with greenish-white petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>
