                <h1>Adesmia izquierdi</h1>
<p>Adesmia izquierdi, commonly known as the Iztaccihuatl plant, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in high-altitude regions. It is noted for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adesmia izquierdi plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia izquierdi has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with five pinkish-white petals, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soils where the plant grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia izquierdi is primarily native to the western regions of Mexico, specifically in the states of Sinaloa, Nayarit, and Jalisco.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. This plant is commonly associated with coastal dunes and limestone formations, where it adapts to harsh, dry conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia izquierdi was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive in wetland and riparian habitats. The plant spreads rapidly through its seed pods, which disperse seeds over long distances.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to the displacement of native vegetation and degradation of local ecosystems.</p>
