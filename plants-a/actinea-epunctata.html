<p>Actinea epunctata, commonly known as the punctate actinia, is a species of sea anemone found in shallow marine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent polyps and a distinctive pattern of small, dark spots on its body. The organism typically inhabits rocky substrates in temperate coastal regions. Its reproductive system involves both sexual and asexual methods, contributing to its population stability.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile structure, it is often found in sheltered areas to avoid strong currents.</p>
