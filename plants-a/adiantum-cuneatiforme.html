                <h1>Adiantum cuneatiforme</h1>
<p>Adiantum cuneatiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a glossy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum cuneatiforme is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum cuneatiforme has frond-shaped leaves that are narrow, lanceolate, and arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green color and a delicate, translucent appearance.</p>
<p>The plant has a slender, upright stem with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a creeping or upright manner depending on the environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-yellow in color, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it to anchor and spread in moist, shaded habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cuneatiforme is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Georgia, Florida, and Texas.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors and along stream banks. This fern is commonly associated with the Appalachian region and parts of the Gulf Coast. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant plant species.</p>
<p>Adiantum cuneatiforme is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cuneatiforme was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has established itself in various habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, stream margins, and disturbed areas across the North Island. The plant's ability to thrive in moist environments has contributed to its spread in the region. Although it is considered a non-native species, it has not been classified as invasive in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Its presence highlights the importance of monitoring introduced plant species for ecological impact.</p>
