                    <h1>Adiantum cuneatiforme</h1>
<p>Adiantum cuneatiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a glossy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum cuneatiforme is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities.</p>
