<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage that forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant features vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Aechmea reukartiana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea reukartiana has rosette-shaped leaves that are typically broad, stiff, and arranged in a tight spiral, forming a dense rosette.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually green with a waxy coating and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant has a short, thick, and somewhat woody stem that is often covered in a layer of moss-like material.
