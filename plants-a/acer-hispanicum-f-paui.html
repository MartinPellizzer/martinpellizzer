                        <h1>Acer hispanicum f. paui</h1>
<p>Acer hispanicum f. paui, commonly known as the Spanish maple, is a rare and distinctive variant of the European maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, palmate leaves that are typically red or orange in autumn, adding vibrant color to the landscape. The plant is native to the Iberian Peninsula and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>
