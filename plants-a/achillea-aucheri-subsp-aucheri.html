                <h1>Achillea aucheri subsp. aucheri</h1>
<p>Achillea aucheri subsp.</p>
<p>aucheri, commonly known as the Armenian cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of dark green, finely toothed leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent yellow centers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and blooms from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and long-lasting flowers, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea aucheri subsp.</p>
<p>aucheri has basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, with a bluish-green color and a woolly texture, arranged in a rosette formation. The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-brown bark, growing from the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, white to pale pink, arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene, with tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea aucheri subsp.</p>
<p>aucheri is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan. It has been introduced to various parts of Europe and North America, where it is now cultivated in gardens and naturalized in some areas.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes and grasslands. It typically grows at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its wild populations are threatened by habitat loss and overgrazing, leading to concerns about its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea aucheri subsp.</p>
<p>aucheri is a hardy perennial known for its feathery foliage and bright yellow flowers. It can be propagated through seeds or division, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining variety characteristics. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune spent flower heads to encourage rebloom. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
