<p>Arachnorchis attingens subsp.</p>
<p>gracillima, commonly known as the slender spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or loamy soils within heathlands and open forests.</p>
<p>The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a single, narrow leaf and a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. Its flowering period occurs in late winter to early spring, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
