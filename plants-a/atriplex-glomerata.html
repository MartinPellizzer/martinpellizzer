                    <h1>Atriplex glomerata</h1>
<p>Atriplex glomerata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers, which are typically followed by small, bead-like fruits. It is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Atriplex glomerata plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
