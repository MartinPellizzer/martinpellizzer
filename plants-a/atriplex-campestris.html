<p>Atriplex campestris, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and has been introduced to many other regions. The plant is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and its ability to produce a large, dry, wind-dispersed seed head. Its leaves are typically succulent and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Atriplex campestris is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain areas.</p>
