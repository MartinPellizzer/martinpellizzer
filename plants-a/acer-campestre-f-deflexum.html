                        <h1>Acer campestre f. deflexum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre f. deflexum, commonly known as the creeping maple, is a variant of the field maple characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit.</p>
<p>It features small, ovate leaves with a doubly serrated margin, typically turning yellow in the autumn. The plant produces samaras, or winged seeds, which aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to gardens and ecological landscapes.</p>
