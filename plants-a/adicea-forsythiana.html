                <h1>Adicea forsythiana</h1>
<p>Adicea forsythiana, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Adicea forsythiana is often cultivated for its unique foliage and is used in both ornamental gardening and traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea forsythiana has leaves that are opposite in arrangement, ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they are typically 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green color, with a creeping growth pattern that often forms a low shrub. The flowers are yellow, with four petals and four sepals, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea forsythiana is primarily native to the eastern United States, including states such as Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in woodland edges, stream banks, and shaded moist areas. This plant is also known to occur in parts of southeastern Canada, particularly in Ontario and Quebec. It is a member of the Apiaceae family and is often referred to as the "white sweet cicely.".</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific habitats, it is considered a relatively rare and localized species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea forsythiana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been reported in Washington, Oregon, and parts of California. The plant was introduced primarily as an ornamental species due to its attractive yellow flowers. It has since spread to some extent in natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains relatively limited compared to other non-native species in the region.</p>
