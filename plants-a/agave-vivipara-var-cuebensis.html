<p>Agave vivipara var. cuebensis, commonly known as the Cuebense Agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces offsets, or "pups," at the base, which is a form of vegetative reproduction known as viviparity. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
