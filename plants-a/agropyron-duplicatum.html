<p>Agropyron duplicatum, commonly known as the crested wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the steppes of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, stiff, needle-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple, adding to its visual appeal. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable species for erosion control and forage.</p>
<p>Agropyron duplicatum is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
