                    <h1>Alfredia nivea</h1>
<p>Alfredia nivea, commonly known as the snow alfredia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-white foliage that gives it a frost-like appearance, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are followed by ornamental red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is valued in both ornamental horticulture and ecological landscaping.</p>
