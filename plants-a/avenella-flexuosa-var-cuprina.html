                    <h1>Avenella flexuosa var. cuprina</h1>
<p>Avenella flexuosa var. cuprina, commonly known as the coastal avenella, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden winds, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes and heathlands.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
