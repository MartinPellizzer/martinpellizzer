                <h1>Acer palmatum subvar. elegans</h1>
<p>Acer palmatum subvar. elegans, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely dissected, palmate leaves that display vibrant red, orange, and yellow hues in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters, with a rounded, compact form. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and appear in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more textured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum subvar. elegans has leaves that are finely dissected, palmate in shape, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color during the growing season and a striking red or orange hue in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it grows in a upright, graceful form. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum subvar. elegans is a variant of the Japanese maple native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Japan.</p>
<p>It is now cultivated in many parts of the world, including North America and Europe, where it is grown for its ornamental value. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in forest understories. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not considered endangered in its native habitat, its wild populations are threatened by habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum subvar. elegans is a compact, ornamental maple known for its delicate foliage and vibrant seasonal color changes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-hardwood cuttings in late summer or by seed, though the latter is less common due to low germination rates. This variety grows slowly, reaching maturity over several years, with new growth appearing in early spring and foliage turning red in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining, slightly acidic soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune lightly to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a shaded garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum subvar. elegans is a ornamental plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local pollination networks. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the aesthetic value of the landscape. The plant also contributes to erosion control due to its dense root system, which stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for small creatures.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
