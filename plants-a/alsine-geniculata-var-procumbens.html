                    <h1>Alsine geniculata var. procumbens</h1>
<p>Alsine geniculata var. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate alsike clover, is a low-growing, mat-forming annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are oval to lance-shaped, often with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings as a green manure or cover crop.</p>
