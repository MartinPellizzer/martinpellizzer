                <h1>Acriopsis densiflora</h1>
<p>Acriopsis densiflora, commonly known as the denseflowered acris, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae, also known as the carrot or parsley family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Native to parts of Asia and the Middle East, this plant thrives in temperate climates and well-drained soils. The plant's structure and growth habits make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky or arid environments, where it adapts to harsh conditions through its efficient water conservation mechanisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acriopsis densiflora has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they are typically 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are arranged in dense clusters, with five petals and stamens, and bloom in late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis densiflora is primarily native to Borneo, Malaya, and Sumatera.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of these regions. It thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks and in lowland areas. The plant is known for its dense foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to Southeast Asia, specifically within the mentioned countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis densiflora was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become invasive in certain regions. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native species.</p>
