<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Asparagus undulatus is well adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient species in its native environment.</p>
