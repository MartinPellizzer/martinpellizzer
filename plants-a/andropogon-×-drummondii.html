<p>Andropogon × drummondii, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a hybrid grass species native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, typically growing in open, disturbed habitats such as prairies and roadsides. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
