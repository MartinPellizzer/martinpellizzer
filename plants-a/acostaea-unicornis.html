                <h1>Acostaea unicornis</h1>
<p>Acostaea unicornis, commonly known as the unicorn fern, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its striking, elongated fronds that resemble a single, flowing horn.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with moderate light and nutrient-rich substrates. The plant's rhizome system allows it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats that provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland habitat.</p>
<p>Acostaea unicornis is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving streams.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acostaea unicornis has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, featuring white petals with a subtle pink hue, and bloom in late spring; they are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, nutrient-rich soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acostaea unicornis is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and the Gulf Coast regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This species is commonly found in areas with consistently moist soil and partial to full sunlight. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable plant in some parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acostaea unicornis was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and partial shade, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses. This plant is known for its unique, single-lobed leaves and delicate, orchid-like flowers. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native flora.</p>
