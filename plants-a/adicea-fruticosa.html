                <h1>Adicea fruticosa</h1>
<p>Adicea fruticosa, commonly known as the common sandverbena, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. Adicea fruticosa is adapted to withstand drought and heat, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments.</p>
<p>It is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea fruticosa has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. Its flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, featuring five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea fruticosa is a shrub native to southern Africa, particularly found in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in these regions, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including some areas of the United States and Australia. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Adicea fruticosa is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not at immediate risk of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adicea fruticosa is a hardy shrub known for its resilience and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method. The plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in about two to three years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like powdery mildew can occur in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>
