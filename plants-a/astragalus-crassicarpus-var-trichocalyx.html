                    <h1>Astragalus crassicarpus var. trichocalyx</h1>
<p>Astragalus crassicarpus var. trichocalyx, commonly known as the hairypod milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in spikes, followed by inflated, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and desert habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in dryland areas.</p>
