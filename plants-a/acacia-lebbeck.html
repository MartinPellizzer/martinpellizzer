                        <h1>Acacia lebbeck</h1>
<p>Acacia lebbeck, commonly known as the black acacia, is a deciduous tree native to South and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The tree produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fibrous pulp. It is often found in dry, tropical, and semi-arid regions, and it plays a significant role in soil stabilization and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Acacia lebbeck is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in ecological restoration.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia lebbeck is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, semi-arid, and seasonally flooded areas, often growing in open woodlands and scrublands. This species thrives in regions with well-drained soils and is often associated with degraded or disturbed habitats. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is widely used in agroforestry and soil stabilization due to its hardy nature and rapid growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia lebbeck was mainly introduced to South Asia, Africa, and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its rapid growth, which makes it useful for afforestation and soil stabilization. The plant is also valued for its hard wood and nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits agricultural land. However, it has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now widespread in tropical and subtropical areas where it thrives in disturbed soils.</p>
