                <h1>Acronia maduroi</h1>
<p>Acronia maduroi, commonly known as the Maduroi acronia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are opposite and often have a glossy surface.</p>
<p>Acronia maduroi is generally found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia maduroi has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are white with a yellow center, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia maduroi is primarily native to the southern regions of Brazil, specifically the states of Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of eastern Paraguay and northern Argentina. This plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments, often in lowland forests and along riverbanks. It is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is commonly found in shaded undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia maduroi was mainly introduced to the Greater Antilles, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica, as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there intentionally for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance. The plant has since become established in these regions, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes local flora.</p>
