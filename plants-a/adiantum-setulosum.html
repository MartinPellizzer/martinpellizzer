                <h1>Adiantum setulosum</h1>
<p>Adiantum setulosum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum setulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum setulosum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and are typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are small, usually less than 10 cm in length, with a bright green color that turns bronze in the autumn. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a climbing or trailing pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a dark brown, round capsule that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant, aiding in its ability to climb or trail along surfaces.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum setulosum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, India, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in moist, shaded environments. This fern thrives in mountainous areas and is often associated with forests and rocky outcrops. Its native range extends to parts of the Pacific Islands as well.</p>
<p>Adiantum setulosum is well adapted to humid climates and is often seen growing along streams and in dense undergrowth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum setulosum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks. This fern is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, feathery fronds and ornamental value. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these regions and can sometimes become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
