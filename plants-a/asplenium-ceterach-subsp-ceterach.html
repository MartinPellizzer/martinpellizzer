<p>Asplenium ceterach subsp.</p>
<p>ceterach, commonly known as the rock fern or scaly shield fern, is a species of fern characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. It features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive scaly appearance on the underside, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
