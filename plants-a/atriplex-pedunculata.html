                    <h1>Atriplex pedunculata</h1>
<p>Atriplex pedunculata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces greenish to yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its roots can exude salts, helping to detoxify the soil and making it useful for reclaiming saline land.</p>
<p>Atriplex pedunculata is also valued for its nutritional content and is used in some traditional foods and livestock feed.</p>
