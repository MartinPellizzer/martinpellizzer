                <h1>Actaea longipes</h1>
<p>Actaea longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed bugbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are compound, with lance-shaped leaflets that are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>Actaea longipes thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and wetlands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea longipes has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are palmately lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically reaching up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and smooth with a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are white, clustered in loose panicles, and bloom in late summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a red, globose berry containing numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by birds and other animals.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, rhizomatous, and help the plant survive in shaded, moist environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea longipes is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, wooded areas such as forests and streamside habitats. This plant thrives in regions with rich, well-drained soil and partial to full shade. Its distribution spans from New England down through the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is particularly common in states like Pennsylvania, New York, and Michigan.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea longipes was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of North America.</p>
<p>It has been documented in areas such as Washington and Oregon, where it has established populations in moist, shaded forest environments. This plant is often found in disturbed sites, including along stream banks and in forested wetlands. Its introduction is likely due to human activity, such as horticultural trade or accidental dispersal.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to its relatively recent establishment in these regions.</p>
