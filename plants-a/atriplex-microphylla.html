                    <h1>Atriplex microphylla</h1>
<p>Atriplex microphylla, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources.</p>
<p>Atriplex microphylla is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh conditions.</p>
