                    <h1>Abies ernestii var. salouenensis</h1>
<p>Abies ernestii var. salouenensis, commonly known as the Salouenensis fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly twisted. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain aromatic seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
