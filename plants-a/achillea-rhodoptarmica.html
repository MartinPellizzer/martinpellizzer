                <h1>Achillea rhodoptarmica</h1>
<p>Achillea rhodoptarmica, commonly known as the pink yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its foliage consists of finely divided, gray-green leaves that are aromatic and slightly fuzzy to the touch.</p>
<p>Achillea rhodoptarmica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well adapted to dry, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea rhodoptarmica has narrow, linear leaves that are grass-like in appearance, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, slender, and somewhat hairy, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and deep-reaching, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea rhodoptarmica is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and limestone soils, often in dry and sunny environments. This plant thrives in mountainous areas and is associated with open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. It is also present in some parts of western Asia, including Turkey and the Caucasus.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea rhodoptarmica was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to establish quickly in poor soil conditions. The plant is known for its bright yellow flowers and tolerance to harsh environmental conditions. It has been introduced in several regions as a competitive plant to suppress weeds.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to unintended ecological impacts if not managed properly.</p>
