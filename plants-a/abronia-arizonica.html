                        <h1>Abronia arizonica</h1>
<p>Abronia arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia arizonica is primarily native to the southwestern United States, specifically Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and sandy soils within desert and semi-desert environments. This species thrives in areas with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure. It is often associated with limestone formations and can be found in canyons and washes.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia arizonica was mainly introduced to areas with sandy soils and arid conditions, particularly in the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Arizona and New Mexico, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained environments. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats, including roadsides and gravelly slopes. Its introduction has been linked to both natural dispersal and human activities.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become an established species in many parts of its range.</p>
