<p>Atriplex morrisii, commonly known as the Morri's saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity.</p>
<p>Atriplex morrisii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
