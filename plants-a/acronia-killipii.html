                <h1>Acronia killipii</h1>
<p>Acronia killipii, commonly known as the Killip's acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and woodland edges. Its small white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acronia killipii is considered endangered and is protected in several states.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia killipii has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia killipii is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. This plant thrives in areas with high moisture and sandy or calcareous soils. Its distribution is limited to a relatively small geographic range, making it a rare and specialized species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Acronia killipii is considered endangered in many parts of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia killipii was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and wetlands. The plant is often spread through human activity, including the movement of soil and plant material. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain environments.</p>
<p>Despite its non-native status, it has become established in some areas and is monitored for ecological impact.</p>
