                <h1>Actinidia cylindrica</h1>
<p>Actinidia cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical actinidia, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, round berries that are typically yellow or red when mature. These berries are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and fruit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia cylindrica has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern through tendrils. The flowers are small, greenish-white in color, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and they bloom in early spring, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a yellowish, cylindrical berry that matures in late summer, containing small seeds dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and moderately deep, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia cylindrica is primarily native to China Southeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of eastern China, particularly in provinces such as Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi. This plant thrives in humid, temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its natural range is limited to these specific geographic areas within southeastern China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia cylindrica was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and potential for fruit production.</p>
<p>It has since spread into native forests and riparian areas, becoming a significant invasive species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and can outcompete native vegetation for resources. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it difficult to control once established.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and protect indigenous ecosystems.</p>
