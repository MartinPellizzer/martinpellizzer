<p>Acacia leptospermoides subsp.</p>
<p>psammophila, commonly known as the sand acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, leathery leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize sandy soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh environments, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
