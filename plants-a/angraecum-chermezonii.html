<p>Angraecum chermezonii, commonly known as the Christmas star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with intricate, star-like patterns that resemble a Christmas star, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without being parasitic. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Angraecum chermezonii is known for its long, fragrant flowers that bloom during the dry season, typically between June and September.</p>
