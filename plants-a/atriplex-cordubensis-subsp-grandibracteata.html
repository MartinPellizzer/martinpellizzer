<p>Atriplex cordubensis subsp.</p>
<p>grandibracteata, commonly known as the grandibracteate saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, bracteate inflorescences, giving it its subspecific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and washland habitats.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
