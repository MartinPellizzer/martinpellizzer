                    <h1>Achyrophorus chondrilloides</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus chondrilloides, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disturbance, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
