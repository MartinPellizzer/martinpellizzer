                <h1>Achyrophorus chondrilloides</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus chondrilloides, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disturbance, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus chondrilloides has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a rough, grayish-brown bark, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are clustered in dense spikes, featuring tiny, greenish-white petals and stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through dryness, dispersing them by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus chondrilloides is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and coastal areas, often found in dry, sunny environments. This plant is commonly associated with calcareous soils and can be seen growing on cliffs, slopes, and along the edges of forests. It is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often considered a characteristic species of Mediterranean vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the unique climatic and geological features of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus chondrilloides was mainly introduced to coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in salt marshes and tidal flats where it thrives in brackish water conditions. This plant was introduced primarily through human activity, such as the dumping of ballast water from ships. It has since become established in these environments, often outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its presence has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
