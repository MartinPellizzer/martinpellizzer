                    <h1>Acer intermedium var. cordisectum</h1>
<p>Acer intermedium var. cordisectum, commonly known as the dissected maple, is a variant of the intermediate maple characterized by its unique leaf morphology.</p>
<p>Its leaves are deeply lobed, often appearing almost fern-like due to the intricate division of the leaf blade. This plant typically grows in temperate regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is valued for its ornamental appeal, particularly in gardens and landscapes where its delicate foliage stands out.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution.</p>
