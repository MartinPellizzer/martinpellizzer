                    <h1>Asplenium × vinaniteloense</h1>
<p>Asplenium × vinaniteloense, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between *Asplenium bulbiferum* and *Asplenium trichomanes*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and hybrid origin make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
