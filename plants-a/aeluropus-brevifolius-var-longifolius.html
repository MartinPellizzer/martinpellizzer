                    <h1>Aeluropus brevifolius var. longifolius</h1>
<p>Aeluropus brevifolius var. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often longer than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>This grass plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
