<p>Arundo formosana, commonly known as the Formosa reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically borne at the top of the stems. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and riverbanks, and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it both a valuable and potentially invasive species in certain regions.</p>
