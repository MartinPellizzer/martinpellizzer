<p>Astragalus psilacanthus subsp.</p>
<p>pseudopsilocentros, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, compound leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in raceme inflorescences, which are typically followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
