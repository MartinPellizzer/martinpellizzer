<p>Ascyrum edisonianum, commonly known as the Edison's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are often submerged or floating. It is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, which includes other carnivorous plants like the sundew and the butterwort.</p>
<p>Ascyrum edisonianum plays a unique role in its ecosystem by contributing to nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
