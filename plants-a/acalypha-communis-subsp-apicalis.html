<p>Acalypha communis subsp.</p>
<p>apicalis, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive red veins on its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha communis subsp.</p>
<p>apicalis belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some green algae, characterized by their complex structures and ability to perform photosynthesis. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and often possessing jointed stems.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species, such as those in the rose and citrus families. Its order is Malpighiales, a diverse group of flowering plants that includes many species with unique floral structures and ecological adaptations. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes a wide range of plants with diverse forms and often contains toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupweed," characterized by their showy bracts and often hairy foliage.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha communis, a widespread plant in the Euphorbiaceae family known for its variable morphology and adaptability to different environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha communis subsp.</p>
<p>apicalis is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil Southeast, Brazil West-Central, and Paraguay. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed or open habitats. The subspecies is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptability to a variety of environmental conditions across South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha communis subsp.</p>
<p>apicalis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is often found growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Although it is not considered a major invasive species, it can compete with native vegetation in some habitats.</p>
