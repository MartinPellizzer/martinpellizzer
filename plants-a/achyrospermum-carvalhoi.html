                <h1>Achyrospermum carvalhoi</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum carvalhoi, commonly known as the Brazilian sunflower, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow ray flowers and greenish-yellow disk flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with upright stems and palmate leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum carvalhoi has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, slightly hairy texture and a pale green to brownish color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with white to pale yellow petals and a tubular corolla, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, ellipsoid seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum carvalhoi is a flowering plant native to Brazil, specifically found in the northeastern region of the country.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few locations within its native range, primarily in the state of Bahia. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in open areas with well-drained soil. This species is typically found at altitudes between 50 and 300 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, Achyrospermum carvalhoi is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum carvalhoi is a tropical flowering plant known for its vibrant blooms and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage more blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum carvalhoi is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its vibrant flowers attract a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat. It acts as a companion plant in agroecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops through improved soil conditions. The plant also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil and prevents runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological balance by supporting local fauna and promoting a healthy ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum carvalhoi is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses, primarily found in tropical regions.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, some local communities may use its leaves in traditional dishes. In medicinal practices, it has been explored for potential anti-inflammatory properties, though research is still in early stages. Its role in industrial or economic applications remains unclear due to a lack of commercial cultivation.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in certain indigenous communities, though specific meanings are not well-documented.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum carvalhoi has several popular cultivars that are prized for their vibrant flowers and ornamental value, such as 'Pink Beauty' and 'White Star'.</p>
<p>While it is primarily cultivated as a species, some hybrids have been developed to enhance its color palette and growth habits. These hybrids often exhibit improved disease resistance and extended blooming periods, making them more suitable for garden use. The plant holds horticultural importance due to its ability to thrive in warm climates and its decorative appeal in landscaping.</p>
<p>Its varieties are particularly popular in regions with mild winters and sunny conditions.</p>
