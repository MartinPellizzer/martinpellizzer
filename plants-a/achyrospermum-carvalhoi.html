<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that resemble those of the sunflower. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and palmately lobed leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as grasslands and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an attractive species for both ornamental and ecological purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum carvalhoi has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a yellow center, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>

<p>This species is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these African countries. It typically grows in open woodland and grassland habitats. The plant is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It is often seen as a component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum carvalhoi was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of South America, particularly in Brazil, where it has been cultivated for ornamental purposes. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its attractive, showy flowers and adaptability to various environmental conditions. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
