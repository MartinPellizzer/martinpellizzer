                    <h1>Anastraphia gomezii</h1>
<p>Anastraphia gomezii, commonly known as the Gomez's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated inflorescence and small, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and climate change, Anastraphia gomezii faces significant threats to its survival.</p>
