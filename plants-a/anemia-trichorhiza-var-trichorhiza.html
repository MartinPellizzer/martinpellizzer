<p>Anemia trichorhiza var. trichorhiza, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it supplements its nutrient intake through prey capture. Its roots are often anchored in mud or sand, and it exhibits a unique ability to float or sink depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The species is widely distributed across temperate regions and is known for its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
