                <h1>Acrostichum pilosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum pilosum, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Acrostichum pilosum plays an important role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pilosum has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 30 to 60 centimeters in length, with a deep green color and a velvety texture on the upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers with three sepals and three petals, which are yellowish in color and bloom from late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, with each seed having a wing-like structure for aerial transport.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies in wetland habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pilosum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, lowland areas such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid environments with high rainfall and is often associated with wetlands and coastal areas. It is also occasionally found in parts of the Caribbean and the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes both freshwater and brackish environments, making it adaptable to a variety of wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pilosum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential use in horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and along riverbanks. The plant has adapted well to various soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it has become invasive in some areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
