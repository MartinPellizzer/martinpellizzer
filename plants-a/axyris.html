                    <h1>Axyris</h1>
<p>Axyris, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often blooming during the rainy season. Axyris species typically have thick, fleshy leaves and stems adapted to conserve water, making them well-suited for harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>They are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
