                <h1>Achillea coronopifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea coronopifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its common name is derived from the mythological figure Achilles, who was said to have used the plant for healing.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea coronopifolia has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-white underside and a coarse, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, rigid, and has a dark green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene that is dispersed by wind, and the seeds are released in a pappus that aids in their spread.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself and access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea coronopifolia is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and Algeria, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. This species prefers sunny, well-drained soils and is commonly found in open habitats like scrublands and coastal areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Achillea coronopifolia is considered vulnerable, and its conservation status is a growing concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea coronopifolia is a perennial plant known for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, blooming in its second year before dying back.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea coronopifolia is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring flora by attracting beneficial insects. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing slopes and degraded land.</p>
<p>Achillea coronopifolia also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
