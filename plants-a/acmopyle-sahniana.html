                <h1>Acmopyle sahniana</h1>
<p>Acmopyle sahniana, commonly known as the Sahns' acmopyle, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmopyle sahniana has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmopyle sahniana is primarily native to Fiji.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical regions of the island nation, particularly in coastal and lowland areas. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. The species is commonly associated with disturbed habitats and human-modified landscapes.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to the Fiji archipelago, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmopyle sahniana was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers.</p>
<p>It has since spread to other parts of Europe and parts of North Africa. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environments. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread beyond cultivated areas.</p>
