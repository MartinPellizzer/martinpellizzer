                <h1>Acinos infectus</h1>
<p>Acinos infectus, commonly known as the Sierra foothill star, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its star-shaped yellow flowers and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Acinos infectus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in open grasslands and woodland edges.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos infectus has leaves that are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-gray color and a hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, covered in fine hairs, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense heads, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant thrive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos infectus is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in countries such as France, Italy, and Spain.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Mediterranean basin, where it thrives in rocky and limestone soils. This plant prefers arid or semi-arid environments and is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Acinos infectus typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is listed as a species of conservation concern in several regions, though its overall conservation status remains relatively stable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acinos infectus is a rare and delicate flowering plant that thrives in specific environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly propagated through seed sowing or by dividing mature clumps, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acinos infectus includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in early spring.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils and requires consistent but moderate watering to avoid root rot. Fertilization should be minimal, with a balanced slow-release fertilizer applied in spring, while pruning is limited to removing dead or damaged foliage.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from fungal issues in overly wet conditions, and it benefits from companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or yarrow.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acinos infectus is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its deep root system helps with erosion control, stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and promoting a balanced habitat for various species.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acinos infectus is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, known for its small, pink or white flowers and its historical significance in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>It has been used in herbal remedies to treat digestive issues and respiratory ailments due to its potential anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. While not widely cultivated for culinary purposes, it has been occasionally used in local cuisines for its aromatic leaves. The plant also holds cultural value in certain regions, where it is associated with resilience and endurance.</p>
<p>However, its industrial and economic applications are limited, and further research is needed to fully explore its potential.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acinos infectus has a limited number of recognized cultivars, with 'Albus' and 'Lutescens' being the most popular for their distinct white and yellow flower colors, respectively.</p>
<p>While natural hybrids are rare, some horticulturalists have attempted crossbreeding to enhance specific traits such as flower size and color. These cultivars are valued for their ornamental appeal in rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to their unique appearance and adaptability to cooler climates, Acinos infectus holds horticultural importance in specialized gardening communities.</p>
<p>However, its cultivation remains relatively uncommon compared to more widely grown alpine species.</p>
