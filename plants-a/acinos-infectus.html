                <h1>Acinos infectus</h1>
<p>Acinos infectus, commonly known as the infected acino, is a flowering plant species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically hairy foliage. The plant grows in rocky, arid environments and has small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Acinos infectus is often found in open, sunny areas and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos infectus has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 1 to 3 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered with fine hairs, and has a light green to grayish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and arranged in clusters, blooming in early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soils in which the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos infectus is primarily native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Great Basin and the Mojave Desert. This plant thrives in rocky soils and open habitats such as slopes and crevices. It is often associated with sagebrush and other drought-tolerant vegetation.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos infectus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity or accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it common in grasslands and rocky slopes. This plant has a low-growing habit with small, woolly leaves and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its introduction has led to competition with native species in some areas, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
