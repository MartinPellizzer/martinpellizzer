                <h1>Acidocroton ekmanii</h1>
<p>Acidocroton ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and diverse morphological features. The plant typically has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and prominent venation. Its flowers are small and clustered, often surrounded by colorful bracts that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Acidocroton ekmanii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidocroton ekmanii has leaves that are typically elliptical or lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and vary in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a glossy texture. The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically yellow or greenish-yellow, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton ekmanii is primarily native to Cuba.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical regions of the island, particularly in moist, shaded habitats within the forest understory. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and thrives in areas with high humidity. The plant is often encountered in the humid lowland and montane forests of Cuba.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within the country.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton ekmanii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the North Island, particularly in coastal and lowland areas. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats. It has been reported in conservation areas where it may compete with native species.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential invasive nature.</p>
