                    <h1>Arundarbor helferi</h1>
<p>Arundarbor helferi, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of delicate, pale blue or white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
