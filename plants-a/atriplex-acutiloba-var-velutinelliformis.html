                    <h1>Atriplex acutiloba var. velutinelliformis</h1>
<p>Atriplex acutiloba var. velutinelliformis, commonly known as the velvetleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Its morphology and ecological tolerance make it an important plant in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
