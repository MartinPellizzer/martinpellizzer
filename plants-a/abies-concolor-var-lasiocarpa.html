                        <h1>Abies concolor var. lasiocarpa</h1>
<p>Abies concolor var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the subalpine fir, is a variant of the white fir native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more rigid than those of the typical white fir. The cones are typically reddish-brown and persist on the branches for several years, adding to the plant's ornamental value. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in montane and subalpine forests.</p>
<p>The plant has a slow growth rate and is adapted to cold, moist conditions, making it a resilient species in alpine ecosystems.</p>
