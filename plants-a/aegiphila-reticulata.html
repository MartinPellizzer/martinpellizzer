                <h1>Aegiphila reticulata</h1>
<p>Aegiphila reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined aegiphila, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila reticulata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
