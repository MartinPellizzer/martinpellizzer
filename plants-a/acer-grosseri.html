<p>Acer grosseri, commonly known as the giant maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Acer grosseri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its striking foliage.</p>
