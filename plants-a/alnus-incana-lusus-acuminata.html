                    <h1>Alnus incana lusus acuminata</h1>
<p>Alnus incana lusus acuminata, commonly known as the rough alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and its alternate, simple, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that release winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water sources.</p>
<p>This species is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil restoration efforts.</p>
