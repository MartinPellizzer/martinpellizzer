                    <h1>Ammophila littoralis</h1>
<p>Ammophila littoralis, commonly known as the coastal grass, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is adapted to sandy soils and high salinity, making it a key species in stabilizing dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-dispersed seeds. It plays an important role in preventing erosion along shorelines.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it a valuable component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
