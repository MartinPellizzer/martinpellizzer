<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia. Aspegrenia species are typically found in arid or rocky environments, thriving in well-drained soils. They are adapted to withstand drought conditions due to their thick, water-storing leaves.</p>
<p>The plants are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
