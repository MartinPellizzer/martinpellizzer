<p>Argyroxiphium caligini, commonly known as the cloud forest ginger, is a rare plant native to the high-altitude regions of Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which reflects the humid and misty conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils and requires consistent moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
