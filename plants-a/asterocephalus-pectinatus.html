                    <h1>Asterocephalus pectinatus</h1>
<p>Asterocephalus pectinatus, commonly known as the woolly star, is a rare and unusual plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, woolly appearance, with dense, white to grayish hairs covering its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle contrast to its fuzzy foliage. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soils with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
