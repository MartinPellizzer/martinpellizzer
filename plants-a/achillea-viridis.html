                <h1>Achillea viridis</h1>
<p>Achillea viridis, commonly known as green yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright green, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers.</p>
<p>Achillea viridis is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea viridis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-gray bark that becomes more fibrous with age. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a cypsela, with small, wind-dispersed seeds that are released in autumn.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea viridis is primarily native to Europe, western Asia, and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often seen in open habitats. It is particularly common in regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes countries such as France, Spain, and Turkey.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea viridis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste grounds, and agricultural fields.</p>
