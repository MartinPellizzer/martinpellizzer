<p>Althaea officinalis subsp.</p>
<p>micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical species.</p>
<p>The plant produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its mucilage-rich roots, which have been used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties.</p>
