                <h1>Aeluropus lagopoides</h1>
<p>Aeluropus lagopoides, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in coastal and inland salt marshes, often forming dense mats. The plant has narrow, silver-hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Aeluropus lagopoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus lagopoides has narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat, linear, and typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stems are short and creeping, with a smooth, slightly reddish-brown surface, growing close to the ground in a mat-like pattern. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to brown florets, blooming during the summer months, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the soil and absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
