                    <h1>Aconitella scleroclada</h1>
<p>Aconitella scleroclada, commonly known as the desert larkspur, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions through its deep root system and waxy leaf coating, which reduces water loss. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that disperse via wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas.</p>
