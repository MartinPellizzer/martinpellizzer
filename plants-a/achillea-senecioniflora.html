<p>Achillea senecioniflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, typically growing in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish to golden flowers. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>The plant has a strong, aromatic scent and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea senecioniflora has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish composite heads composed of many tiny florets, blooming in the summer months and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant establish quickly in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea senecioniflora is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is now found in various regions across the western U.S., including parts of Arizona and Utah, as well as in some areas of Mexico. This species thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in grasslands, shrublands, and open woodlands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea senecioniflora is listed as a species of concern in some areas due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea senecioniflora is a hardy, drought-tolerant perennial known for its bright yellow flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds directly in the garden after the last frost. This plant has a long growth cycle, blooming from late spring to early fall, with a dormant period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in early spring, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or yarrow enhances its ornamental value and supports a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>
