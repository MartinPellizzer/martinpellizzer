                <h1>Achillea senecioniflora</h1>
<p>Achillea senecioniflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, lance-shaped leaves and its clusters of small, yellowish-white composite flowers. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic foliage. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes.</p>
<p>Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea senecioniflora has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are gray-green in color, with serrated edges and a woolly texture, typically measuring 10â€“20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and greenish-gray in color, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are yellow, composite structures with ray florets and disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea senecioniflora is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in states such as Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and California. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats like grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes parts of the Chihuahuan and Sonoran Deserts.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea senecioniflora was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and drought-tolerant nature. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in open habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among land managers due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
