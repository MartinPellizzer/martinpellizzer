                <h1>Adenostyles nardosmia</h1>
<p>Adenostyles nardosmia, commonly known as the fragrant bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bell-shaped, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or purple. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Adenostyles nardosmia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and pleasant scent.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles nardosmia has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a rough, grayish bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern with branching near the base. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles nardosmia is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with rocky outcrops and coastal bluffs.</p>
<p>Adenostyles nardosmia is an important part of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles nardosmia was mainly introduced to areas with moist, temperate climates, typically in regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodlands and along stream banks where it can thrive in partial shade. This plant is often spread through seed dispersal by wind and water, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in disturbed habitats and garden settings.</p>
