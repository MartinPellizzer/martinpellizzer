<p>Artemisia takeshimensis, commonly known as desert sagebrush, is a hardy shrub native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and aromatic, pungent scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils.

Its small, yellow flowers appear in late spring and are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences.</p>
<p>Artemisia takeshimensis plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
