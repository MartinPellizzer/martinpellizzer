                <h1>Acriopsis ridleyi</h1>
<p>Acriopsis ridleyi, commonly known as the Malayan cowpea, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Leguminosae, also known as the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or green, and it produces edible pods that contain small, round seeds.</p>
<p>Acriopsis ridleyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some parts of its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acriopsis ridleyi has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are trifoliate, with leaflets that are elliptic to ovate in shape, medium-sized, and usually dark green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that exhibits a creeping growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in umbels, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis ridleyi is primarily native to Borneo, Malaya, and Thailand.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical regions of these Southeast Asian countries. It typically grows in forested areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. Acriopsis ridleyi is often associated with secondary growth and can be found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis ridleyi was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Guam, the Mariana Islands, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats, including roadsides, open forests, and coastal areas. The plant is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and fibrous roots, which contribute to its adaptability. It has been documented as an invasive species in some areas, posing a threat to native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely influenced by human activity and environmental conditions that favor its growth.</p>
