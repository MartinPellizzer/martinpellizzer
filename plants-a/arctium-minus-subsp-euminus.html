<p>Arctium minus subsp.</p>
<p>euminus, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture and distinctive purple-tinted flower heads. Its fruit is a spiny bur, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows.</p>
