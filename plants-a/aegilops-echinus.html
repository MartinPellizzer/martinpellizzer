                <h1>Aegilops echinus</h1>
<p>Aegilops echinus, commonly known as the spiny goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spiny glumes. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are enclosed in tough, bristle-tipped husks. Aegilops echinus is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, rocky environments.</p>
<p>It has been studied for its potential role in agricultural systems due to its adaptability and resilience.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops echinus has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually linear, parallel-veined, and arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a single, unbranched pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to white flowers that bloom in early summer, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled achene that is dispersed by wind due to its lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>
