<p>Androsace septentrionalis subsp.</p>
<p>subumbellata, commonly known as the northern sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of northern Europe and Siberia. It features dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in umbellate inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>The subspecies subumbellata is distinguished by its more compact inflorescences compared to other subspecies of Androsace septentrionalis.</p>
