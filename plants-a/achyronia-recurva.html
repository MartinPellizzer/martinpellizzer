                <h1>Achyronia recurva</h1>
<p>Achyronia recurva, commonly known as the curlleaf mountain-mahogany, is a shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that often curl at the edges. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Achyronia recurva plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia recurva has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 3 to 7 cm in length, and a dark green color with slightly serrated margins.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a creeping or trailing pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia recurva is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. This species thrives in humid, subtropical climates with abundant moisture. It is often associated with disturbed or open areas within its native range.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia recurva was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, vacant lots, and along urban edges. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds make it a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered highly invasive in its native range.</p>
