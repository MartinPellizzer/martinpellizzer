                    <h1>Asplenium × liberiense</h1>
<p>Asplenium × liberiense, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and hybrid origin make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
