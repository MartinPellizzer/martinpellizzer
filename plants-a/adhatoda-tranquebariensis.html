                <h1>Adhatoda tranquebariensis</h1>
<p>Adhatoda tranquebariensis, commonly known as the Indian Trumpet or Blue Trumpet, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is a woody shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and striking blue-violet flowers. The plant produces small, cylindrical fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and medicinal properties make it a notable species in botanical gardens and traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda tranquebariensis has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a greyish-brown bark that is rough and fissured, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in racemes, typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, helping the plant anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda tranquebariensis is primarily native to the eastern coastal regions of India, particularly the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is commonly found in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant is often associated with riverine and marshy habitats, where it forms part of the dense vegetation. It is also known to grow in the coastal areas of the Bay of Bengal.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely linked to the monsoon climate and the availability of waterlogged soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda tranquebariensis was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. The plant is valued for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It has been reported in several countries including India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
