                    <h1>Arenaria tequilana</h1>
<p>Arenaria tequilana, commonly known as the Tequila sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening in dry climates.</p>
