                    <h1>Acronia chama</h1>
<p>Acronia chama, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Acronia chama is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
