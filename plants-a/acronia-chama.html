                <h1>Acronia chama</h1>
<p>Acronia chama, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Acronia chama is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia chama has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size of about 5-7 cm in length and a waxy, dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows in a spreading, low shrub form. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and wing-like structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb moisture efficiently from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia chama is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the coastal plains of South Carolina and Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is commonly found in dune environments and along the edges of maritime forests. This plant is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and periodic flooding. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia chama was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive in several areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant spreads primarily through seeds dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability have raised concerns among local conservationists.</p>
