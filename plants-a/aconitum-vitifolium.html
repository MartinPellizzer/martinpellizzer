                    <h1>Aconitum vitifolium</h1>
<p>Aconitum vitifolium, commonly known as the grape-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, palmately compound leaves that resemble grape leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or woodland soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a potentially dangerous plant for both humans and animals.</p>
