                <h1>Achnatherum longearistatum</h1>
<p>Achnatherum longearistatum, commonly known as the western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned flowers. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Western wheatgrass is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum longearistatum has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically flat, linear, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a length ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light green to brown color, growing in a clump or spreading manner depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various grassland habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum longearistatum is primarily native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Great Basin and the Intermountain West. This grass species thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in open plains and disturbed areas. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends into northern Mexico as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum longearistatum was mainly introduced to areas where it can thrive in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. This plant has been reported in several regions of the United States, particularly in the western states. Its introduction is often associated with human activity, such as land development and transportation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can spread rapidly in new environments.</p>
