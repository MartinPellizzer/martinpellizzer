                <h1>Aconitum altissimum</h1>
<p>Aconitum altissimum, commonly known as the tall monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in a helmet-like shape typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has dark green, doubly pinnate leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Like other members of the genus, it contains potent toxins, making it both dangerous and a subject of caution in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum altissimum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a rough texture and a width of up to 30 cm.</p>
<p>The stem is tall, upright, and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that is often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple, and arranged in dense, spires, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted for anchoring in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum altissimum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments with cold climates and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters. It is also present in some areas of the Russian Far East and northern China.</p>
<p>Due to its rugged habitat, it is relatively rare and often grows in isolated populations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum altissimum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks. This plant is known for its tall, spiky flowers that range in color from blue to purple. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it can be toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
