<p>Asplenium planicaule, commonly known as the maidenhair spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the shape of a fern's traditional form. The plant typically grows in crevices of rocks or on tree trunks, showcasing its epiphytic nature. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which is a common feature among ferns.</p>
