                <h1>Aechmea corymbosa</h1>
<p>Aechmea corymbosa, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Aechmea corymbosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance and ability to thrive in indoor environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea corymbosa has rosette-shaped leaves that are long, narrow, and sword-like, arranged in a dense spiral pattern around the central rosette, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, sturdy stem with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright from the base. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, branched flower spike with showy, violet to red bracts, and small white to pink flowers that bloom during the summer months, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by birds and mammals eating the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the surrounding environment.</p>
