                            <h1>Azorella Coriacea</h1>
<p>Azorella cushion, scientifically known as Azorella coriacea, is a unique and resilient plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It forms dense, low-growing cushions that can survive in extreme cold and harsh environmental conditions. This plant is often found in the Andes and Patagonia, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils and intense sunlight. Its ability to store water in its thick, leathery leaves allows it to endure long periods of drought. Despite its seemingly simple appearance, the Azorella cushion plays a vital ecological role in its alpine habitat.</p>
