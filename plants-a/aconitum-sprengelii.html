                <h1>Aconitum sprengelii</h1>
<p>Aconitum sprengelii, commonly known as Sprengel's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant features palmately compound leaves with a distinctive, spurred petal at the back of its flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a potentially dangerous plant to handle.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum sprengelii has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petal-like sepals and numerous yellow stamens, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving in cold, mountainous environments.</p>
