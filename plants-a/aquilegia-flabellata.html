<p>Aquilegia flabellata, commonly known as the fanleaf columbine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that resemble a fan, hence its common name.

It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
