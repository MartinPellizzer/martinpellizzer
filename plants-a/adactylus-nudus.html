                <h1>Adactylus nudus</h1>
<p>Adactylus nudus, commonly known as the naked leaf scale, is a small, scale-like plant belonging to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, leaf-like structures that lack the complex branching seen in many other lichens. This plant typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, where it can tolerate extreme conditions. Its morphology is adapted for survival in low-nutrient, high-salinity soils.</p>
<p>Adactylus nudus plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adactylus nudus has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a pale green bark that is smooth and slightly fibrous, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adactylus nudus is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky habitats and dry, open areas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with cliffs and coastal regions. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, helping to prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats where it can tolerate the harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adactylus nudus was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has been found in regions with warm and humid climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats, including roadsides and agricultural fields. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>However, more research is needed to fully understand its ecological impact.</p>
