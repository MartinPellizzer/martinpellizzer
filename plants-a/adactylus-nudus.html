                    <h1>Adactylus nudus</h1>
<p>Adactylus nudus, commonly known as the naked leaf scale, is a small, scale-like plant belonging to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, leaf-like structures that lack the complex branching seen in many other lichens. This plant typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, where it can tolerate extreme conditions. Its morphology is adapted for survival in low-nutrient, high-salinity soils.</p>
<p>Adactylus nudus plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
