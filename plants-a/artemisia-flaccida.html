<p>Artemisia flaccida, commonly known as silky wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage with finely divided, aromatic leaves that emit a distinctive, often camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in loose, open inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Artemisia flaccida is also valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies.</p>
