                <h1>Adoxa xizangensis</h1>
<p>Adoxa xizangensis, commonly known as the Tibetan adoxa, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Adoxaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, showcasing adaptations to cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adoxa xizangensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, with a smooth texture and an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbel-like inflorescences, with white petals and a greenish calyx, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the rocky and arid environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adoxa xizangensis is primarily native to China South-Central and Tibet.</p>
<p>This species is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, typically in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is adapted to the high-altitude environment characterized by cold temperatures and limited soil nutrients. The plant's distribution is largely restricted to specific microhabitats within these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adoxa xizangensis was mainly introduced to the data as a rare and endemic species native to the Xizang region of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations to high-altitude environments. The introduction of this plant into the dataset highlights its importance in botanical research and conservation efforts. It provides valuable insights into the biodiversity of the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>This distribution data aids in understanding its ecological niche and potential threats to its survival.</p>
