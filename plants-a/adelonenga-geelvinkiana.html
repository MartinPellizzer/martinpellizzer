                <h1>Adelonenga geelvinkiana</h1>
<p>Adelonenga geelvinkiana, commonly known as the Geelvink's orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the Moluccas in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Adelonenga geelvinkiana is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelonenga geelvinkiana has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, consisting of four petals and five stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonenga geelvinkiana is primarily native to the island of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the lowland rainforests of the western and central regions of the island. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with high rainfall. It is commonly associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within New Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonenga geelvinkiana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions like Fiji and Vanuatu.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests where it thrives in humid, tropical conditions. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil types. However, it has also been reported to spread into natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction is largely attributed to horticultural trade and landscaping activities in these regions.</p>
