                            <h1>Allionia Cervantesii</h1>
<p>Cervantes' allionia, scientifically known as Allionia cervantesii, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the arid regions of Baja California. This species is named in honor of the renowned Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes, reflecting its cultural significance in the region. Its delicate, bright red flowers bloom in late summer, making it a notable addition to local flora. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme heat and drought. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
