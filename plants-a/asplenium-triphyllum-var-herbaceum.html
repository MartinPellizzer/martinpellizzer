<p>Asplenium triphyllum var. herbaceum, commonly known as the three-leaf spleenwort, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its trifoliate (three-lobed) leaves, which are often clustered at the base. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's herbaceous nature and delicate foliage make it a unique addition to woodland ecosystems.</p>
