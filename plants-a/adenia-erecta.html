                <h1>Adenia erecta</h1>
<p>Adenia erecta, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a striking climbing plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters and can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>Adenia erecta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to warm, humid climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia erecta has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, cylindrical, and covered with a rough, fissured bark that is typically reddish-brown in color. Its flowers are large, showy, and borne in clusters, with a yellowish-green to cream color, and they bloom during the wet season, pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, berry-like capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia erecta is primarily native to Zambia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the northern and central regions of the country. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, shaded areas. It is typically found in forested regions and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Zambia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia erecta was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of eastern Australia, where it thrives in humid, subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the eastern coastline, from northern New South Wales to southern Queensland. This plant is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flowers. It has been successfully established in several urban and semi-natural environments across the region.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
