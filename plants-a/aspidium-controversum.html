<p>Aspidium controversum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Aspidium controversum is notable for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability and supporting diverse microfauna in its habitat.</p>
