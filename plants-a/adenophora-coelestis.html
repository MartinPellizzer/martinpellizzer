                <h1>Adenophora coelestis</h1>
<p>Adenophora coelestis, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features showy, pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands.</p>
<p>Adenophora coelestis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora coelestis has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and range from 3 to 7 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and serrated edges.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is typically herbaceous and branching. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and display a striking blue-violet color, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora coelestis is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan provinces. This plant typically grows in mountainous areas with moist, well-drained soils. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to this specific region in southern-central China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora coelestis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers and hardy nature. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas into natural habitats, posing a potential threat to native ecosystems. Its distribution is now primarily confined to moist meadows and open woodlands.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a topic of ongoing ecological study.</p>
