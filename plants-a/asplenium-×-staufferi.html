                    <h1>Asplenium × staufferi</h1>
<p>Asplenium × staufferi, commonly known as the hybrid bird's nest fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a rosette-like structure, resembling a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
