                    <h1>Ainsliaea cleistogama</h1>
<p>Ainsliaea cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous ainsliaea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique reproductive strategy, producing both open and closed (cleistogamous) flowers. The cleistogamous flowers are self-pollinating and often remain hidden within the plant's foliage. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial with slender stems and small, clustered leaves.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on reproductive biology and plant adaptation.</p>
