<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments.</p>
