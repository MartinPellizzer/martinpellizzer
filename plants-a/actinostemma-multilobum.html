                <h1>Actinostemma multilobum</h1>
<p>Actinostemma multilobum, commonly known as the mountain pimpernel, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and often edible plants. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemma multilobum has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, bloom in late spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemma multilobum is primarily native to the northern regions of North America, specifically Canada and the northern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in boreal and subarctic environments, growing in open, moist habitats such as tundra and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in cool climates and is often associated with disturbed or nutrient-poor soils. It is particularly common in the Yukon and Alaska, extending southward into parts of Montana and Idaho.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemma multilobum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states like California, Oregon, and Washington.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along streambanks. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in open habitats. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
