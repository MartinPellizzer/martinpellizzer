                    <h1>Alkanna tinctoria var. marica</h1>
<p>Alkanna tinctoria var. marica, commonly known as the red sandalwood or Indian lac, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a resinous sap that hardens into a reddish-brown substance, which has been historically used for dyeing textiles and as a natural varnish. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>The plant's unique chemical composition contributes to its traditional medicinal uses and industrial applications.</p>
