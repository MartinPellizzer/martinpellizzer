<p>Aspidium ramosum var. eumundi, commonly known as the Eumundi water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green to brownish in color. The plant thrives in wet, shady environments, often found near streams or in damp forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to moist conditions and its role in aquatic and riparian ecosystems.</p>
