<p>Anacampseros verlotii, commonly known as the Verlot's ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
