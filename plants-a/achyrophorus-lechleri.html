                <h1>Achyrophorus lechleri</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus lechleri, commonly known as the caucau or sangre de drago, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, woody shrub that produces dark red latex, which has been traditionally used in folk medicine. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its latex contains compounds with potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects.</p>
<p>The plant's ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various rainforest species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus lechleri has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically reddish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a spreading crown. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, blooming in the spring, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are extensive and fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself in the soil and absorb nutrients from the environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus lechleri is primarily native to the Amazon Basin, particularly in the western regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Bolivia. This plant thrives in the humid tropical rainforests, often growing in the understory of dense vegetation. It is commonly associated with the Loreto and Ucayali regions of Peru, where it is traditionally used by indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the specific ecological conditions of the Amazonian rainforest.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus lechleri was mainly introduced to areas with moist, temperate climates where it can thrive in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>It has been introduced to parts of North America, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, due to its medicinal properties and ornamental value. The plant is commonly found in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil, which supports its growth and spread. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native environments.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a low-risk species in most ecosystems where it is cultivated.</p>
