                        <h1>Acacia deuteroneura</h1>
<p>Acacia deuteroneura, commonly known as the mountain acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spindly branches and phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. Acacia deuteroneura is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
