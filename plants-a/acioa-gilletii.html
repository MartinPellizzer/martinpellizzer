                <h1>Acioa gilletii</h1>
<p>Acioa gilletii, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its stems are erect and branching.</p>
<p>Acioa gilletii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acioa gilletii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa gilletii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. This plant typically grows in humid, lowland areas with rich soil. It is often associated with rainforests and is part of the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and less commonly studied species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa gilletii was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the early 20th century by horticulturists who were interested in cultivating exotic species. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in several regions across the North Island. Its distribution is primarily concentrated in coastal and lowland areas where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
