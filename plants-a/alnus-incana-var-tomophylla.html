<p>Alnus incana var. tomophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often near streams or in riparian areas. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive silvery-white underside that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that release seeds when mature.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
