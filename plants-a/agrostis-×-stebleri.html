                    <h1>Agrostis × stebleri</h1>
<p>Agrostis × stebleri, commonly known as the hybrid bentgrass, is a sterile intergeneric hybrid resulting from the cross between Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis stolonifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model for studying hybridization in grass species.</p>
