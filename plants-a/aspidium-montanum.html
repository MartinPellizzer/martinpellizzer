                    <h1>Aspidium montanum</h1>
<p>Aspidium montanum, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Aspidium montanum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
