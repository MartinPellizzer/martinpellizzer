                            <h1>Aspidium × Uliginosum</h1>
<p>Common brake, scientifically known as Aspidium × uliginosum, is a fern species commonly found in wetland environments across temperate regions. This plant is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often dark green and covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with peat bogs and marshy areas. Despite its delicate appearance, common brake is resilient and can withstand periodic flooding. Its presence is an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems.</p>
