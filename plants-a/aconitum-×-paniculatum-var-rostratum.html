<p>It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features palmate leaves with deeply cut lobes, often covered in a fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum × paniculatum var. rostratum has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically reaching up to 20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. The flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, arranged in an umbellate or paniculate inflorescence, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum × paniculatum var. rostratum is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in areas of the Alps and Carpathians.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Austria, Switzerland, Italy, and Romania, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It typically grows in woodlands, meadows, and along streambanks at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare species with a conservation status of Vulnerable in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum × paniculatum var. rostratum is a striking perennial known for its tall, spires of deep blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of rhizomes, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, though it often behaves as a short-lived perennial, producing flowers in its second year.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning dead foliage after flowering helps maintain its appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs, which can be managed with organic controls.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns enhances its ornamental value in shaded gardens.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
