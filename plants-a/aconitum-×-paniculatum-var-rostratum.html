                    <h1>Aconitum × paniculatum var. rostratum</h1>
<p>Aconitum × paniculatum var. rostratum, commonly known as the rostrate monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
