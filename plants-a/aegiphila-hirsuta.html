<p>Aegiphila hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy aegiphila, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky soils. Its leaves are often aromatic and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Aegiphila hirsuta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila hirsuta has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a hairy texture and a bluish-green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered with fine hairs, displaying a grayish-green color, and grows in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects.
