                <h1>Achlys californica</h1>
<p>Achlys californica, commonly known as the California ghostflower, is a rare and elusive member of the nightshade family.</p>
<p>It is a biennial herb that produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that open at night. The plant is native to the coastal areas of California and thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. It has a short, fibrous root system and hairy stems that help it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achlys californica has basal leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged in a rosette, and ranging from 2 to 5 inches in length, typically displaying a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a rough, bark-like texture, and grows upright from the rosette of leaves. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, rocky soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achlys californica is primarily native to British Columbia, California, Oregon, and Washington.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. It thrives in the temperate climate of the Pacific Northwest region of North America. The species is often associated with coniferous forests and is well adapted to the wet, cool conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the western United States and parts of western Canada.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achlys californica was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It has been found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, open woods, and along stream banks. The plant's introduction is likely due to its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in both moist and dry conditions. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions because of its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>However, it also plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife.</p>
