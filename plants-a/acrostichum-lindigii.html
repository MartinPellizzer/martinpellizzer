                <h1>Acrostichum lindigii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum lindigii, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, broad shape that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Acrostichum lindigii is often found in humid forests and is valued for its ornamental foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lindigii has large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a broad, feather-like shape.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is woody and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses its seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lindigii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and tidal forests. This plant is well adapted to saline and waterlogged soils, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. It is often used in traditional medicine and has cultural significance in the regions where it is found.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the availability of brackish water and warm, moist climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lindigii was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near water sources such as streams, ponds, or wetlands.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions where there is high humidity and consistent rainfall. This plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats, including along roadsides and in abandoned agricultural fields. Its introduction has sometimes led to its establishment in non-native regions, where it can outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range.</p>
