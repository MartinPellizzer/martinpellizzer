                        <h1>Acaulon rosulatum</h1>
<p>Acaulon rosulatum, commonly known as the rosette liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette growth form, with leaves arranged in a tight, circular pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure consists of a central stem with closely packed, scale-like leaves that help retain moisture.</p>
<p>Acaulon rosulatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaulon rosulatum is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with maritime environments. It is known for its rosette growth form and is adapted to the mild, wet winters and dry summers of its native range.</p>
<p>Acaulon rosulatum is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaulon rosulatum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, particularly in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. This plant is often found in temperate regions where it can receive partial to full shade. Its introduction has been noted in several parts of North America and Europe.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
