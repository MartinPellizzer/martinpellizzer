                    <h1>Alsophila minervae</h1>
<p>Alsophila minervae, commonly known as the Minerva tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and longevity. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique feature makes it a rare and fascinating example of botanical adaptation.</p>
