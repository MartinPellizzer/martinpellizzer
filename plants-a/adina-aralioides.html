<p>Adina aralioides, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red cedar, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits containing black seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is also valued for its durable timber.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina aralioides has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium to large in size, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branched pattern. The plant produces small, white flowers in compound umbels during the summer months, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a red, fleshy drupe that disperses its seeds through animal consumption, with the seeds being small and enclosed in a juicy pulp.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina aralioides is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in these areas, its current distribution has expanded to include parts of Hawaii and other tropical regions where it has been introduced. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Adina aralioides is commonly found at altitudes ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and limited threats, it is currently listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adina aralioides is a tropical evergreen shrub known for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid environments with indirect light.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize it with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and prune regularly to maintain shape and encourage bushier growth. It is relatively pest and disease resistant but may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or other shade-loving plants can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>
