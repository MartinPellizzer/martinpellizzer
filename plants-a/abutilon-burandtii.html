<p>Abutilon burandtii, commonly known as the Burandt's cottonwood, is a shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus plants. The plant is characterized by its velvety, fuzzy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal or riverine areas.</p>
<p>Its fibrous bark and soft, hairy foliage make it distinct within its genus.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon burandtii has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a waxy green surface and a slightly velvety texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody as the plant matures. Its flowers are pendulous, with five petal-like sepals that are yellowish-green, and they bloom in late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a hairy capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon burandtii is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern California and northern Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the southeastern part of its native range. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils within coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitats. This species is typically found at elevations between 50 and 300 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Abutilon burandtii is listed as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
