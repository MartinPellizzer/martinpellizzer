                <h1>Acrostichum chrysolepis</h1>
<p>Acrostichum chrysolepis, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often bright green with a golden hue on the underside. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The golden fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum chrysolepis has large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are sturdy and upright, with smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically yellow or green in color, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark, spherical drupe that contains one seed, dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum chrysolepis is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove forests and swampy areas. This plant is well-adapted to saline and brackish water conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. It is often used in traditional medicine and for its ornamental value due to its attractive, leathery leaves.</p>
<p>Its native range is largely confined to the Indo-Malesian region, where it plays a significant ecological role.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum chrysolepis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential use in landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and wetlands where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate salt spray. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range in Southeast Asia due to human activity and climate change.</p>
