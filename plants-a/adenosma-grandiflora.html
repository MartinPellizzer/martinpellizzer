                <h1>Adenosma grandiflora</h1>
<p>Adenosma grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered adenosma, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture with a strong scent.</p>
<p>Adenosma grandiflora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma grandiflora has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged oppositely along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are showy, with five petals forming a bell-shaped structure, typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma grandiflora is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in forest understories and along riverbanks, where it benefits from high humidity and partial shade. It is also present in parts of India and Sri Lanka, where it grows in similar environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Adenosma grandiflora is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in gardens and cultivated areas in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma grandiflora was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found along the edges of wetlands and disturbed areas. It has become naturalized in some regions, raising concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered a potential invasive species in certain areas.</p>
