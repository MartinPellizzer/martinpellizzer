                <h1>Acridocarpus rudis</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus rudis, commonly known as the rough acridocarpus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Anacardiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been studied for its potential pharmacological properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus rudis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale grey bark that grows upright and branching. Its small, clustered flowers are pale yellow, consisting of five petals and stamens, and bloom during the dry season, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus rudis is primarily native to the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Fiji, and Tonga.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. It is well adapted to the warm, moist climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Acridocarpus rudis plays an important ecological role in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus rudis was mainly introduced to urban and coastal areas for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in landscaped gardens, roadsides, and along railway tracks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have led to its spread beyond cultivated areas into natural ecosystems. Due to its invasive potential, it is now considered a weed in several regions where it has established itself.</p>
<p>Management efforts focus on controlling its spread through mechanical removal and herbicide application.</p>
