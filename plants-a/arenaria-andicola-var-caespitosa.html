                    <h1>Arenaria andicola var. caespitosa</h1>
<p>Arenaria andicola var. caespitosa, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to alpine regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions such as cold temperatures and strong winds. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in high-altitude meadows and is an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
