                <h1>Achyronia macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Achyronia macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited achyronia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves and showy, yellow flowers. The plant produces large, fleshy fruits that are typically eaten by various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia macrocarpa has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically green and have a smooth texture, with a slightly wavy margin.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are white or pale yellow, with a bell-shaped structure, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia macrocarpa is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This plant is commonly found in areas with saturated soil and high humidity. It plays an important ecological role in these habitats by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the availability of water and specific soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia macrocarpa was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It has been found in states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. The plant was likely introduced for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since naturalized in some regions, raising concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now considered invasive in certain areas where it outcompetes local vegetation.</p>
