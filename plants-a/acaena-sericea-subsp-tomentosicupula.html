                        <h1>Acaena sericea subsp. tomentosicupula</h1>
<p>Acaena sericea subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosicupula, commonly known as the silky burrplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny capsules that contain numerous small seeds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in coastal and montane areas, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena sericea subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosicupula is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions of the Southern Alps.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It is commonly associated with rocky and gravelly soils.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and is an important component of the local flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena sericea subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosicupula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of Acaena species for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is now considered an environmental weed in certain regions of New Zealand. Its spread has been facilitated by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its capacity to form dense stands.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it has become a target for weed control programs in affected areas.</p>
