                <h1>Achyrocline hyperchlora</h1>
<p>Achyrocline hyperchlora, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing yellow-orange blooms that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline hyperchlora has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged oppositely along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, light green bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline hyperchlora is primarily native to Argentina Northwest and Bolivia.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in the region's high-altitude grasslands and shrublands. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The species is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of these areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these geographic regions in South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline hyperchlora was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and degraded pastures.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high sunlight exposure and moderate to well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in the Caribbean, parts of Central America, and the southern United States. Its introduction is often linked to human activities like land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
