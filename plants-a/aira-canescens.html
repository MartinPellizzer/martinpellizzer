<p>Aira canescens, commonly known as the common hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, hair-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize various wetland environments.</p>
<p>Aira canescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates.</p>
