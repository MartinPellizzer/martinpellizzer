                        <h1>Acelica holosericea</h1>
<p>Acelica holosericea, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it may have limited cultivation due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acelica holosericea is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded, moist environments. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, making it a characteristic species of tropical rainforests. It is also occasionally found in coastal areas where the climate remains warm and humid throughout the year.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acelica holosericea was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of an ornamental plant collection. The plant has since spread beyond its original introduction sites. It is now considered a potential weed in certain regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited but expanding due to its adaptability to local climates.</p>
