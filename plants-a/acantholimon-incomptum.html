                        <h1>Acantholimon incomptum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon incomptum, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features narrow, blue-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Acantholimon incomptum is an important species for stabilizing dune ecosystems and supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
