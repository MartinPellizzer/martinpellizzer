                <h1>Aeginetia trimenii</h1>
<p>Aeginetia trimenii, commonly known as the Malabar nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeginetia trimenii has leaves that are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with a spreading habit. Its flowers are small, clustered in axillary racemes, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
