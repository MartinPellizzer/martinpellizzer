                <h1>Acridocarpus pondoensis</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus pondoensis, commonly known as the Pondo sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other economically important plants like the cashew and mango. The tree is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its use in furniture and traditional crafts. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive elliptical shape with a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Acridocarpus pondoensis thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in dry forest and scrubland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus pondoensis has simple, alternate leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody and cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that develops fissures as the plant matures. The flowers are small and clustered in panicles, featuring white to pale yellow petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus pondoensis is primarily native to the island of Pondo in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. The plant is endemic to Pondo, meaning it is not found anywhere else in the world. It grows as a shrub or small tree, often in coastal areas with rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus pondoensis was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and receives ample sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The distribution of this species has expanded in recent years due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. It is now cultivated in several countries across Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
