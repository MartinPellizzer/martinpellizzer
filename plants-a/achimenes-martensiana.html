<p>Achimenes martensiana, commonly known as the red-flowered achimenes, is a tropical perennial plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink and orange. The plant produces striking, velvety bracts that often contrast with the flower color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Achimenes martensiana is often cultivated as a garden ornamental due to its vibrant blooms and compact growth habit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes martensiana has leaves that are heart-shaped, arranged oppositely along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a bright green color and slightly hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are tubular with five petals, typically pink or red in color, blooming from summer to autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes martensiana is primarily native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and surrounding areas. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is often associated with moist woodlands and riverine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in other parts of the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes martensiana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses in countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and parts of the United States. The plant thrives in warm climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming naturalized in certain areas, posing a potential risk to local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it requires careful management to prevent unintended spread.</p>
