                <h1>Acronia hirtzii</h1>
<p>Acronia hirtzii, commonly known as the hairy acronia, is a species of flowering plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which provide a distinctive appearance. It produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Acronia hirtzii is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or swampy areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia hirtzii has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and slightly woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale pink, featuring five petals and stamen, and bloom in early spring, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia hirtzii is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often associated with hardwood forest understories. It is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, its distribution has become more restricted in recent years.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia hirtzii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to a variety of landscapes. The plant is commonly found in regions with temperate climates, particularly in the northeastern United States. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including land development and transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common weed in urban and rural settings.</p>
