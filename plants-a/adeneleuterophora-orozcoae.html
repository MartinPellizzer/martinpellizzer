                <h1>Adeneleuterophora orozcoae</h1>
<p>Adeneleuterophora orozcoae, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers emit a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adeneleuterophora orozcoae has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unbranched. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a pale yellow color, blooming during the spring season and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adeneleuterophora orozcoae is primarily native to the high-altitude cloud forests of central Mexico, specifically in the states of Guanajuato and Michoac√°n.</p>
<p>This species thrives in humid, shaded environments within these montane regions. It is typically found in rocky soils and among dense vegetation in the Sierra Madre mountain ranges. The plant is adapted to the cool and moist conditions characteristic of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adeneleuterophora orozcoae was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including land development and transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
