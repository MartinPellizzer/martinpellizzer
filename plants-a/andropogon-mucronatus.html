<p>Andropogon mucronatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Andropogon mucronatus plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems.</p>
