                <h1>Adelia brandegeei</h1>
<p>Adelia brandegeei, commonly known as the Brandegee's lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showing adaptations to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its bulbs store nutrients for periods of dormancy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Adelia brandegeei is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia brandegeei has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant to anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia brandegeei is primarily native to Mexico Northwest.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the northern regions of Mexico, specifically in the states of Chihuahua and Durango. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The species is adapted to the harsh climate of the region, which includes low precipitation and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in this area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia brandegeei was mainly introduced to areas with specific soil and climate conditions that mimic its native habitat.</p>
<p>It is typically found in regions with well-drained soils and moderate temperatures. The plant has been reported in several locations across the United States, particularly in the southwestern states. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to monitor and manage its spread.</p>
