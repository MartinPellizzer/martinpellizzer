<p>Anemopsis californica, commonly known as the California water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in late summer and are clustered in umbels, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Anemopsis californica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for aquatic organisms.</p>
