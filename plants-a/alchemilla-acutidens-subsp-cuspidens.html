<p>Alchemilla acutidens subsp.</p>
<p>cuspidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. It has a low-growing habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
