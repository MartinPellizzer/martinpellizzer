<p>Aizoon cymosum, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Aizoon cymosum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
