                <h1>Adiantum pauperculum</h1>
<p>Adiantum pauperculum, commonly known as the poor fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum pauperculum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum pauperculum has fern-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a delicate, light green color and a size ranging from 10 to 20 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and creeping, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows along the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish in color, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pauperculum is primarily native to southern China, including regions such as Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous areas with high humidity. This fern is commonly associated with forest floors and rocky crevices, where it can access the necessary moisture and nutrients. Its native range also extends into parts of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and Myanmar.</p>
<p>Adiantum pauperculum is well adapted to the cool, temperate climates of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pauperculum was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and high humidity, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with rich, well-drained soil, often near streams or in forest understories. This plant has been introduced to parts of North America, particularly in the eastern United States, where it has established itself in moist, shaded habitats. Its introduction is often associated with horticultural practices and the cultivation of ornamental ferns.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it has been introduced.</p>
