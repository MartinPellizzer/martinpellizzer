                <h1>Adiantum tetragonum</h1>
<p>Adiantum tetragonum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are dark green and often have a slightly glossy appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new shoots. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two levels of smaller leaflets, giving it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum tetragonum thrives in shady, humid environments and is often used as a decorative plant in both indoor and outdoor settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum tetragonum has fern-like leaves that are triangular in shape, with a delicate, lace-like appearance and a pale green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a cluster of spores, and the plant disperses them via wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum tetragonum is primarily native to Brazil Northeast and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This fern species is commonly found in the humid tropical regions of these areas. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. The plant is well adapted to the warm and humid climate of these regions.</p>
<p>It is often seen growing in mountainous and coastal areas within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum tetragonum was mainly introduced to gardens and indoor spaces due to its attractive, delicate fronds and ease of care.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate regions where it is cultivated as a decorative plant. The species is often used in hanging baskets or as a potted plant because of its compact growth habit. Its ability to thrive in low-light conditions makes it popular among novice plant growers.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
