                <h1>Acineta fulva</h1>
<p>Acineta fulva, commonly known as the yellow acineta, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy, yellowish stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Acineta fulva is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>It is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acineta fulva has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age. It produces small, clustered flowers that are yellow in color, with four petals and a tubular structure, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>

<p>It is found in the eastern and western Cape provinces. This plant thrives in coastal and inland fynbos vegetation. It is commonly associated with sandy and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Acineta fulva is a small, flowering plant that is often seen in open, sunny habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta fulva was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in temperate regions. This plant has been reported in several countries, including the United States, Canada, and parts of Europe.
