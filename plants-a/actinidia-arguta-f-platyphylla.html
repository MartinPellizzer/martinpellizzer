                <h1>Actinidia arguta f. platyphylla</h1>
<p>Actinidia arguta f. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf kiwifruit, is a cultivar of the kiwi plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and small, edible fruits that are typically less hairy than the standard Actinidia deliciosa. The plant is a vigorous, deciduous vine that thrives in temperate climates and requires a cold winter dormancy period. Its fruits are usually consumed raw or used in jams and desserts, and the plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and fruit production.</p>
<p>The flat-leaf form is a result of selective breeding aimed at improving fruit quality and ease of cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia arguta f. platyphylla has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows as a climbing shrub or vine.
