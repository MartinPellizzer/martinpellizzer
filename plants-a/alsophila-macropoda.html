<p>Alsophila macropoda, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, facilitating reproduction in moist conditions.</p>
<p>Alsophila macropoda plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests, providing habitat and contributing to forest structure.</p>
