                <h1>Achillea inodora</h1>
<p>Achillea inodora, commonly known as lesser yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. It has a creeping root system that allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Achillea inodora is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea inodora has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and green, growing from the base to form a compact plant. The flowers are yellow, consisting of numerous small ray florets surrounding a central disk, and bloom from June to August, pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea inodora is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is now also distributed in some areas of the Middle East and has been introduced to other regions worldwide. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea inodora is not considered threatened and is listed as a species of least concern by conservation organizations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea inodora is a hardy perennial known for its fragrant foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining its genetic traits. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, going through active growth in spring and summer, followed by a rest period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like thyme or marigold can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea inodora is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including beneficial insects and birds, which contribute to the health of the ecosystem. This plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other flowering species to enhance biodiversity and support pollinator habitats. Its dense growth also helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in open or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea inodora contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting a diverse array of organisms in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea inodora is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and use in gardens as a decorative plant.</p>
