                    <h1>Aspidium lorifrons</h1>
<p>Aspidium lorifrons, commonly known as the broad-lobed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
