<p>Astragalus sommieri subsp.</p>
<p>acmophylloides, commonly known as the Sierra foothill milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
