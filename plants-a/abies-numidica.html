                        <h1>Abies numidica</h1>
<p>Abies numidica, commonly known as the Atlas cedar, is a coniferous tree native to the Atlas Mountains of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Abies numidica is well adapted to rocky, arid environments and is often found at high altitudes.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abies numidica belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their primitive features and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Pinidae, which refers to a group of coniferous plants that includes pines, firs, and cedars, typically characterized by needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Pinales, a group of coniferous plants that includes various families such as Pinaceae, Cupressaceae, and others, known for their gymnosperm characteristics. Its family is Pinaceae, commonly known as the pine family, which includes coniferous trees with needle-like leaves and woody cones. Its genus is Abies, which consists of evergreen coniferous trees commonly known as firs, characterized by their cylindrical cones and whorled branches.</p>
<p>Its species is Abies numidica, a specific type of fir native to North Africa, known for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies numidica is primarily native to Algeria.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Tell Atlas and Ahaggar ranges. This species thrives in cool, moist environments at higher elevations. It is an important component of the local forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Algeria due to its climatic and soil requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies numidica was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in mild climates.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in gardens and parks across southern Europe, including countries like Spain, Italy, and France. Despite its aesthetic value, it has occasionally escaped cultivation and established itself in natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. The plant prefers well-drained soils and partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of environments.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally limited by its specific climatic requirements and is not considered a major ecological threat in most areas.</p>
