                <h1>Aciphylla dobsonii</h1>
<p>Aciphylla dobsonii, commonly known as the Dobson's bristlebush, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to dry, coastal environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Aciphylla dobsonii plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native insects and birds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla dobsonii has needle-like leaves that are sharp, pointed, and arranged in a rosette pattern, typically measuring 1-3 cm in length and ranging in color from gray-green to silvery blue.</p>
<p>The stem is short and often hidden beneath the leaves, while the bark is smooth and pale greenish-brown, with a low-growing, mat-forming growth pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, with a tubular structure and a short blooming period during late spring to early summer, pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla dobsonii is primarily native to the South Island of New Zealand.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the alpine and subalpine regions, particularly in areas with rocky or gravelly soils. It thrives in the harsh conditions of high altitude environments, often growing on exposed slopes and ridges. Aciphylla dobsonii is well adapted to the cold and dry climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is known for its distinctive silver-gray foliage.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla dobsonii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in dry, sunny environments. This plant is typically found in coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils. It is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
