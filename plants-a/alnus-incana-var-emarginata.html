<p>Alnus incana var. emarginata, commonly known as the rough alder, is a shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its serrated, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer plant in ecological succession.</p>
