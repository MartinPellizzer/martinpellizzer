                <h1>Actinoseris revoluta</h1>
<p>Actinoseris revoluta, commonly known as the spiral cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that often form dense clusters. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Actinoseris revoluta is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinoseris revoluta has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, woody, and has a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish-orange, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoseris revoluta is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This species thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often associated with desert scrub and chaparral habitats. It is most prevalent in states such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, extending into parts of Baja California.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to dry conditions and can survive in regions with limited rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoseris revoluta was mainly introduced to coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest, including Washington and Oregon, as part of ecological restoration efforts.</p>
<p>It was introduced to stabilize dune systems and prevent erosion along sandy shorelines. This plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its introduction has helped restore native habitats but has also raised concerns about its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>However, it remains an important part of the region's coastal flora.</p>
