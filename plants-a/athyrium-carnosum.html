                    <h1>Athyrium carnosum</h1>
<p>Athyrium carnosum, commonly known as the thick-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and thick, which helps anchor it in the soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately compound, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that give the plant a lush, dense appearance.</p>
