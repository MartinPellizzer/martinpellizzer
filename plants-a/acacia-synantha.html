                        <h1>Acacia synantha</h1>
<p>Acacia synantha, commonly known as the white wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are a characteristic feature of the Acacia genus. Its leaves are phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves.</p>
<p>Acacia synantha is adapted to arid environments and is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia synantha belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their ancient lineage and diverse forms. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with a wide range of morphological diversity.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which comprises plants known for their legume fruits and symbiotic nitrogen-fixing relationships with bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large genus of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive foliage and often used in various ecological and commercial contexts.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia synantha, a specific plant within the Acacia genus known for its unique botanical features and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia synantha is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal and inland regions of the state. This species thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils. It is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands.</p>
<p>Acacia synantha plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia synantha was mainly introduced to areas with a tropical and subtropical climate, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It has been successfully established in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and eastern parts. This plant is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it a potential invasive species in some environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has spread to various parts of the world beyond its native range.</p>
