                <h1>Acinodendron domingense</h1>
<p>Acinodendron domingense, commonly known as the Dominican acacia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces elongated pods that contain seeds, and it often grows in coastal or disturbed habitats. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain wildlife.</p>
<p>However, it is considered rare and faces threats from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron domingense has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and they grow upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, with five petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in dry, rocky environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron domingense is primarily native to the Caribbean region, particularly the islands of the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and humid lowland forests. It is commonly associated with sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or secondary habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in parts of its native distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron domingense was mainly introduced to the Caribbean region, particularly in the islands of the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. Despite its beauty, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
