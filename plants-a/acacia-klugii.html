<p>Acacia klugii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia klugii is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savanna and grassland ecosystems. This species is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various animals.</p>
<p>Acacia klugii is also known for its distinctive, flat, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia klugii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, dry climate, typically found in regions with low rainfall.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where it can receive ample sunlight and has good drainage, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and inland regions where it can establish itself quickly due to its drought tolerance. It has been introduced to several parts of the world, including the Mediterranean, parts of Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it a valuable plant for soil stabilization and land rehabilitation.</p>
