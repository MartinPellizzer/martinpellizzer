                    <h1>Athyrium irigense</h1>
<p>Athyrium irigense, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a deciduous fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features elegant, bipinnate fronds that are dark green on the top and silvery-white underneath, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its ability to add texture and color to woodland gardens.</p>
