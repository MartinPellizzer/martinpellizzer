                <h1>Acer ginnala var. yezoense</h1>
<p>Acer ginnala var. yezoense, commonly known as the Yezo maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northeastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmately lobed leaves, which are typically bright green in summer and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala var. yezoense has palmately compound leaves that are typically 5â€“7 lobes, with a bright green color during the growing season and turning red or orange in autumn; the leaves are alternately arranged along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in panicles, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and oval in shape.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala var. yezoense is a variant of the five-leaf maple native to the Korean Peninsula, particularly found in Korea and parts of northeastern China.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various regions, including parts of North America and Europe, where it is grown as an ornamental tree. This species thrives in temperate climates, typically in moist, well-drained soils found in forests or along stream edges. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and increasing cultivation, it is considered a species of low conservation concern, though its wild populations remain relatively stable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala var. yezoense is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. This species has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in about 10 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and consistent watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with grasses or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala var. yezoense is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and supporting other plant growth. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological benefits of carbon sequestration and habitat creation in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala var. yezoense is a decorative tree known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its vibrant fall foliage.</p>
<p>While not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for potential anti-inflammatory properties, though its use remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to local economies through horticultural trade and ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty in regions where it is native, often featured in local art and folklore.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala var. yezoense has several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson Queen' and 'Autumn Flame', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and compact growth.</p>
<p>It is also commonly used in hybrid breeding programs to develop new ornamental maples with improved cold hardiness and color retention. Hybrids involving this species often exhibit enhanced adaptability to urban environments and resistance to common pests and diseases. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>This variety is widely cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and resilience, making it a favorite among landscape designers and garden enthusiasts.</p>
