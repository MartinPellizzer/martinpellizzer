                <h1>Adonis fucensis</h1>
<p>Adonis fucensis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adapted to thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Its root system is deep and resilient, allowing it to survive in poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Adonis fucensis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis fucensis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and slightly hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. Its flowers are showy, with five petals arranged in a radial symmetry, and are typically bright yellow, blooming in early summer and pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its coastal habitat for efficient nutrient uptake.</p>
