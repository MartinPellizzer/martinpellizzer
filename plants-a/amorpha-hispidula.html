<p>Amorpha hispidula, commonly known as the bristly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, hairy stems, and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Amorpha hispidula plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
