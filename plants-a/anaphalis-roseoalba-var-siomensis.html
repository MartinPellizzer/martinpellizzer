<p>Anaphalis roseoalba var. siomensis, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it adapts to cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are covered in fine, silvery hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>The species is closely related to other members of the Asteraceae family, sharing similar floral structures and growth habits.</p>
