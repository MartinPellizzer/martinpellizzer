                <h1>Adelinia grandis</h1>
<p>Adelinia grandis, commonly known as the giant adelinia, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, trifoliate leaves and showy, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Adelinia grandis is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop due to its nutritional value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelinia grandis has compound, pinnate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with elongated leaflets that are usually oval or lance-shaped, varying in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, and have a dark green, glossy upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a slender pod that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight nature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelinia grandis is primarily native to British Columbia, California, Oregon, and Washington.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in moist, forested areas and along stream banks. Adelinia grandis is known for its attractive foliage and is often used in native plant gardens.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the temperate rainforest climates of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelinia grandis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It has been introduced to several other regions for horticultural purposes, although its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most of these areas.</p>
