                    <h1>Asplenium viviparum var. lineatum</h1>
<p>Asplenium viviparum var. lineatum, commonly known as the linear spleenwort, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
