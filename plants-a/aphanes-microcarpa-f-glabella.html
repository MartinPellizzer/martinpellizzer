                    <h1>Aphanes microcarpa f. glabella</h1>
<p>Aphanes microcarpa f. glabella, commonly known as the glabrous sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate habit, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the 'glabella' form lacks these hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by translucent, bladder-like fruits that are distinctive in appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, dry conditions.</p>
