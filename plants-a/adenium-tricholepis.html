                    <h1>Adenium tricholepis</h1>
<p>Adenium tricholepis, commonly known as the Desert Trumpet, is a striking succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, swollen stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or yellow, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are typically narrow and waxy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Adenium tricholepis is also known for its toxic sap, which contains cardioactive compounds and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
