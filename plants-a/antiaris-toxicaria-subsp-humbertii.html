<p>Antiaris toxicaria subsp.</p>
<p>humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's arum, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves and a striking, spadix-like inflorescence that is often surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe.</p>
<p>The plant produces a toxic sap containing calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring moist, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
