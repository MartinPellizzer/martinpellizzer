<p>Actinidia longicauda, commonly known as the hairy actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three to five lobes and covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a bright red or orange color in the fall. These berries are often used in jams and wines due to their high acidity and unique flavor.</p>
<p>Actinidia longicauda is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens.</p>
