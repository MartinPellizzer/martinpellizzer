                <h1>Achras lucuma</h1>
<p>Achras lucuma, commonly known as the cherimoya, is a tropical plant native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with thick, leathery leaves and showy, white flowers. The fruit is a hairy, oblong berry that turns from green to yellow as it ripens. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a unique and valuable species in both horticulture and agriculture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras lucuma has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are glossy green in color, with a smooth texture and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is woody and grows upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a large, spiky, yellow-orange berry that contains numerous seeds, and it is dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb moisture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras lucuma is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically Peru.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal and valley areas of the country, particularly in the departments of Arequipa, Moquegua, and Tacna. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly grown in home gardens and small farms in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Despite its native range, it has been introduced to other parts of the world for ornamental and agricultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras lucuma was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its edible fruits, commonly known as cherimoya.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils, making it suitable for cultivation in parts of South America, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean. The plant has been widely adopted in agricultural systems due to its high nutritional value and unique flavor profile. Its introduction has also contributed to biodiversity in regions where it is now considered an invasive species.</p>
<p>However, proper management is required to prevent ecological imbalances in non-native habitats.</p>
