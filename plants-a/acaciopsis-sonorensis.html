<p>Acaciopsis sonorensis, commonly known as the Sonoran acaciopsis, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
<p>Acaciopsis sonorensis is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor desert regions.</p>
