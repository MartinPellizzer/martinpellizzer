<p>Apostasia ramifera, commonly known as the branched spathephyllum, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a single, elongated floral spike with numerous small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often branched, giving it the species name "ramifera," meaning "branch-bearing.".</p>
<p>The botanical features of Apostasia ramifera make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and taxonomic study.</p>
