                    <h1>Andersoniella</h1>
<p>Andersoniella, commonly known as the Anderson's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often have a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its botanical features include narrow, strap-like leaves and a single, showy flower that blooms in the late afternoon.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Andersoniella is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
