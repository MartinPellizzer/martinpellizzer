                    <h1>Alsophila bisquamata</h1>
<p>Alsophila bisquamata, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, rough-textured cortex. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that are typically arranged in a tight spiral around the trunk. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Alsophila bisquamata plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability.</p>
