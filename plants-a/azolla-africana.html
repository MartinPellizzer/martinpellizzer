                    <h1>Azolla africana</h1>
<p>Azolla africana, commonly known as the African water fern, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Azollaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves and symbiotic relationship with the cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae, which fixes atmospheric nitrogen. This plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in shallow, nutrient-rich ponds and wetlands. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Azolla africana is also used in traditional medicine and as a biofertilizer in agriculture.</p>
