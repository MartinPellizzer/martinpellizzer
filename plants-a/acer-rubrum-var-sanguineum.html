                <h1>Acer rubrum var. sanguineum</h1>
<p>Acer rubrum var. sanguineum, commonly known as the red maple or scarlet maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn brilliant shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn. Its flowers are small, red or yellow, and appear in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and reddish-brown when young, becoming furrowed with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. sanguineum has leaves that are broadly ovate to triangular, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length, displaying a vibrant red color in the fall.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a fast-growing, spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with red sepals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a paired samara, with winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread over a wide area.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. sanguineum is a rare variant of the red maple tree native to the eastern United States, primarily found in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in Tennessee and North Carolina. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mixed forests, often near streams or in shaded understories. This species typically grows at elevations between 600 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. sanguineum is a striking cultivar of the red maple known for its vibrant red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the desired varietal characteristics. This plant grows best in zones 4-8, entering a dormant phase in winter and producing new growth in spring, with peak foliage in early autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, preferring full sun to partial shade, and benefits from balanced fertilization in early spring. Regular pruning helps maintain shape and health, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases, though aphids and scale may occasionally infest it.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. sanguineum is a striking ornamental tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its vibrant red flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, enhancing local biodiversity. The tree also acts as a companion plant in landscaping, offering aesthetic value while supporting ecological balance. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>This species contributes to nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants in the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. sanguineum is a variant of the red maple known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
