                    <h1>Amalias</h1>
<p>Amalias, commonly known as the Japanese anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are alternate along the stems. Amalias thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical name, *Anemone hupehensis*, reflects its origins and its association with the wind, as "anemone" comes from the Greek word for wind.</p>
