                <h1>Adenophora khasiana</h1>
<p>Adenophora khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern regions of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and mountainous regions. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged alternately along the stem, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Adenophora khasiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora khasiana has oval-shaped, alternate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and grows upright, with a light green bark that is smooth when young. Its flowers are bell-shaped, white to pale blue in color, and bloom in summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora khasiana is a rare flowering plant native to the Eastern Himalayas, primarily found in India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>While its native range is restricted to these regions, it is now also cultivated in some botanical gardens and conservation centers. It thrives in moist, temperate forests and rocky slopes, often in shaded undergrowth. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Adenophora khasiana is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenophora khasiana is a hardy, herbaceous perennial native to the Himalayas, known for its delicate blue or purple flowers and ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in spring and early summer, and entering dormancy in late fall.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports growth, while light pruning after flowering helps maintain shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
