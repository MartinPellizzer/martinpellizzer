<p>Alloplectus peruvianus, commonly known as the Peruvian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of host trees, such as oaks and pines, using a specialized structure called a haustellum to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are usually small and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid environment.</p>
<p>Alloplectus peruvianus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
