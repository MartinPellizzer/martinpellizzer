                <h1>Acranthera bullata</h1>
<p>Acranthera bullata, commonly known as the woolly star, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers, which are often pink or purple, bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Acranthera bullata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera bullata has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a pale green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that grows in a straight, branching pattern. Its flowers are small, white to pale blue, clustered in dense spikes, and bloom in spring; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in its native sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera bullata is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich soil. The plant is known for its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Borneo, reflecting its adaptation to the local ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera bullata was mainly introduced to areas with sandy soils and open habitats, such as coastal dunes and inland sandplains.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with low rainfall and full sun exposure, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, indicating its adaptability to changing conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it has been spread through natural dispersal and human activities.</p>
<p>However, its introduction may have ecological impacts on native flora in certain regions.</p>
