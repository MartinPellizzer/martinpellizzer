<p>Abutilon bakerianum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon bakerianum is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland tropical forests. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soils. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends to some islands in the West Indies.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon bakerianum was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was originally from South America, specifically Brazil. The plant was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport on ships or intentional planting. It thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and spread, it poses a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
