<p>Abutilon cubanum, commonly known as Cuban velvetleaf, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its capsules, which contain numerous small seeds, are adapted for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Abutilon cubanum is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon cubanum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, exhibiting a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody at the base, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to reddish-brown in color, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are cup-shaped with five petals, typically yellow or orange in color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth, oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>
