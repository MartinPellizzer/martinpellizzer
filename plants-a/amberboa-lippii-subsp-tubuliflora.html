<p>Amberboa lippii subsp.</p>
<p>tubuliflora, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers in late spring, which are arranged in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to desert conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in drought-prone areas.</p>
