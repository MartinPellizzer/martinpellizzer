<p>Acrostichum stipitatum, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of fine roots, which help anchor it in the soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a lush, feathery appearance.</p>
