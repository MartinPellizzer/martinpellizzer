                <h1>Aechmea tayoensis</h1>
<p>Aechmea tayoensis, commonly known as the Taiti bromeliad, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the humid forests of Central America, particularly in Costa Rica and Panama. This plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and they can grow up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>Aechmea tayoensis produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea tayoensis has leaves that are broad, strap-like, and arranged in a rosette formation, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, thick stem that is covered in a fibrous, grayish-brown bark, growing upright from the base. Its flowers are clustered in a spike at the center of the rosette, with bright red bracts and small, white, tubular flowers that bloom during the dry season. The fruit is a red, fleshy capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network around the base of the plant, helping to anchor it and absorb moisture.</p>
