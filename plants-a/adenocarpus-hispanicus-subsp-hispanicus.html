                <h1>Adenocarpus hispanicus subsp. hispanicus</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus hispanicus subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicus, commonly known as the Spanish milkvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, indehiscent pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal areas and rocky slopes. Adenocarpus hispanicus subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicus is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus hispanicus subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicus has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>Its small, clustered flowers are yellow with five petals, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus hispanicus subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicus is a species native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically Spain. Its current distribution is primarily confined to southern Spain, particularly in regions like Andalusia.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, open habitats such as maquis shrublands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is typically found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern, with its status listed as vulnerable in some regional assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus hispanicus subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicus is a low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plant often grown in Mediterranean climates. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle is typically annual, with rapid growth during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between waterings. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring, and pruning is recommended to encourage bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus hispanicus subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicus is a flowering plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy pink flowers, supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in Mediterranean ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its deep root system, stabilizing soil in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a diverse range of organisms in its habitat.</p>
