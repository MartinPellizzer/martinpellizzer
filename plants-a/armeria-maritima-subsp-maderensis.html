<p>Armeria maritima subsp.</p>
<p>maderensis, commonly known as the Maderan sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems along the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes through its extensive root system.</p>
