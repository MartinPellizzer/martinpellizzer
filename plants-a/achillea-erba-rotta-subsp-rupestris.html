                <h1>Achillea erba-rotta subsp. rupestris</h1>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta subsp.</p>
<p>rupestris, commonly known as the rock yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces upright stems bearing small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to xeriscaped gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta subsp.</p>
<p>rupestris has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and covered with fine hairs, arranged in a rosette formation, and typically measuring up to 10 cm in length. The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly reddish-brown in color, growing from the base and bearing the flowers at the top.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, composite heads made up of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta subsp.</p>
<p>rupestris is a rare plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy, particularly in the Apennines. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations in the Calabria region.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats such as cliffs and slopes. This subspecies is typically found at altitudes ranging from 700 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat degradation, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta subsp.</p>
<p>rupestris is a hardy perennial known for its ornamental yellow flowers and drought-tolerant nature. It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes in early spring.</p>
<p>This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, preferring full sun to partial shade. Fertilization should be done sparingly in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with other drought-tolerant plants like lavender and sedum for companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta subsp.</p>
<p>rupestris is a hardy perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various insects and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its yellow flowers, supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and degraded lands.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting a wide range of wildlife.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta subsp.</p>
<p>rupestris is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe, known for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in rocky soils. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may be occasionally used in herbal teas or infusions for its mild aromatic properties.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it has been used to treat digestive issues and as a mild sedative due to its essential oil content. Industrially, it contributes to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems and supports pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is sometimes associated with resilience and endurance, reflecting its hardy nature in harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta subsp.</p>
<p>rupestris has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated in gardens for their ornamental value, including 'Cerulean' and 'Purpurea,' known for their vibrant blue and purple flower heads. It is also involved in the creation of hybrids that combine the hardiness of its parent species with the showy traits of other yarrow varieties.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit enhanced color, extended blooming periods, and improved disease resistance. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in poor soils and its suitability for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it remains a favored choice among gardeners and landscape designers.</p>
