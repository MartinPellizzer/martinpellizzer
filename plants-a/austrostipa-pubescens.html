                    <h1>Austrostipa pubescens</h1>
<p>Austrostipa pubescens, commonly known as the hairy wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Austrostipa pubescens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna in its native range.</p>
