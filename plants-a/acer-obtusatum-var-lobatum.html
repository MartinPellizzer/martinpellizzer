                <h1>Acer obtusatum var. lobatum</h1>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. lobatum, commonly known as the Japanese maple with lobed leaves, is a deciduous tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant seasonal foliage, which ranges from bright green in spring to shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn. The leaves are typically lobed, giving the plant its varietal name, and they are arranged alternately along the stems. It prefers partial shade to full sun and well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. lobatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a lobed margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, turning red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a moderate growth rate. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in yellow-green clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. lobatum is a variant of the Japanese maple that is native to Japan, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Honshu and Kyushu.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including North America and Europe, as an ornamental plant. It thrives in temperate climates, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. This species typically grows at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters, often in moist, forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and the threats from habitat destruction, it is considered to be of conservation concern in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. lobatum is a decorative maple known for its unique foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. lobatum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and fertility.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. lobatum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional teas or as a decorative element in cooking.</p>
<p>In medicinal applications, it has been explored for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports ecological systems, though it lacks significant economic value in commercial markets. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and symbolic than practical in modern applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. lobatum has several popular cultivars such as 'Kewensis' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their striking foliage and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also commonly used as a parent in hybridization efforts to develop new maple varieties with enhanced ornamental features. Hybrids involving this species often exhibit improved cold hardiness and broader color variation in autumn foliage. Due to its unique leaf shape and seasonal color changes, it holds significant horticultural importance in ornamental gardening and landscape design.</p>
<p>Its versatility makes it a valuable addition to both residential and public gardens.</p>
