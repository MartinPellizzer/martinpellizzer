<p>Antennaria alpina subsp.</p>
<p>canescens, commonly known as the Alpine hairpin, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its grayish, fuzzy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in harsh, high-altitude environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and tundra.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is a common component of alpine plant communities and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
