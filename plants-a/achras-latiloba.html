                <h1>Achras latiloba</h1>
<p>Achras latiloba, commonly known as the banyan tree or giant banyan, is a large tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and sprawling canopy, which can cover extensive areas. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by round, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Achras latiloba is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its various properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras latiloba has large, palmate leaves that are broad, green, and often have a waxy surface, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in branched inflorescences, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a large, spiky berry that splits open to release numerous small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras latiloba is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Socotra, located in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>It is currently found exclusively in its native range on Socotra, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and rocky habitats, often at altitudes between 0 and 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Achras latiloba is listed as a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat degradation and overharvesting.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras latiloba is a slow-growing, evergreen shrub or small tree native to Madagascar, known for its distinctive, spiny trunk and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. The plant has a long growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in well-draining soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and encourage flowering are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or mealybugs, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like cacti or agaves can enhance its growth in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras latiloba is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing soil health and supporting other crops. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes the soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achras latiloba offers ecological benefits by improving soil structure and promoting nutrient cycling.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achras latiloba is a plant known for its versatility, with various uses across different domains.</p>
<p>In culinary applications, its fruit is edible and can be consumed fresh or processed into jams and beverages. Medicinally, it has been traditionally used to treat ailments such as digestive issues and skin conditions. Industrially, its latex is valued for its adhesive properties, contributing to economic activities in certain regions.</p>
<p>Culturally, the plant holds symbolic significance in local traditions and is often associated with resilience and fertility.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achras latiloba has several popular cultivars, including 'Coral Beauty' and 'Coral Curls', which are prized for their vibrant, showy inflorescences.</p>
<p>While the plant is not commonly hybridized due to its specific pollination requirements, some horticulturalists have attempted to develop cultivars with enhanced traits such as longer bloom periods or improved cold hardiness. These cultivars are of horticultural importance in subtropical and tropical regions, where they are cultivated for ornamental purposes. Their unique appearance makes them popular in landscapes and as container plants.</p>
<p>Despite limited hybridization, Achras latiloba remains a valuable addition to botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
