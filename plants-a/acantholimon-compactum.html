<p>Acantholimon compactum, commonly known as the dwarf flaxflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact growth with silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers in early spring, adding a delicate touch to rocky or sandy soils. It is well adapted to coastal environments and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Acantholimon compactum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
