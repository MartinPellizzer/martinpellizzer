<p>Agrostis neglecta, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on open, disturbed soils, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length, with a bluish-green coloration. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Agrostis neglecta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate various environmental conditions.</p>
