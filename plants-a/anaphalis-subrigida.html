<p>Anaphalis subrigida, commonly known as the silverleaf goatweed, is a flowering plant native to regions of Asia, including China, India, and Nepal.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>Anaphalis subrigida is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
