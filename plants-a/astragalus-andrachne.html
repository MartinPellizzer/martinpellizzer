                    <h1>Astragalus andrachne</h1>
<p>Astragalus andrachne, commonly known as the Greek milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Astragalus andrachne is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environments.</p>
