<p>Avenochloa alpina, commonly known as the alpine oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Avenochloa alpina thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
