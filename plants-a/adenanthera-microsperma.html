                <h1>Adenanthera microsperma</h1>
<p>Adenanthera microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded tick tree, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its distinctive yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces small, hard seeds enclosed in pods, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Adenanthera microsperma is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthera microsperma has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are green in color and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in spikes, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a legume pod containing small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind and animal activity.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help stabilize the plant in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera microsperma is primarily native to the Andaman Is., Borneo, Cambodia, China South-Central, China Southeast, Hainan, Jawa, Lesser Sunda Is., Malaya, Myanmar, Nicobar Is., Sumatera, Taiwan, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in lowland forests and along riverbanks. This species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. It is an important component of the local flora in these areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans across Southeast Asia and parts of South China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera microsperma was mainly introduced to Jamaica, Mauritius, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is a leguminous plant that has been widely adopted in these regions for its nitrogen-fixing properties and use in soil improvement. The introduction of this plant has contributed to agricultural sustainability in these areas. It is often used as a forage crop and in agroforestry systems.</p>
<p>Its presence in these locations highlights its ecological and economic importance in tropical environments.</p>
