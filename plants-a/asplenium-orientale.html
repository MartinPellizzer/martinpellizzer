                    <h1>Asplenium orientale</h1>
<p>Asplenium orientale, commonly known as the oriental spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium orientale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
