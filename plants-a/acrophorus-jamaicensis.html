                <h1>Acrophorus jamaicensis</h1>
<p>Acrophorus jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican acorn tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, clustered flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus jamaicensis has compound leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with an upright growth habit. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus jamaicensis is primarily native to the Caribbean region, particularly the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. It is often associated with limestone soils and is commonly found in montane habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus jamaicensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses where it can provide dense foliage and a unique aesthetic. The plant's distribution has expanded due to horticultural interest and its adaptability to different soil types. It is particularly popular in areas with high humidity and mild temperatures.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
