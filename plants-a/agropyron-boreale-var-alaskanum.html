<p>Agropyron boreale var. alaskanum, commonly known as Alaska bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. This species is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, sandy soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in alpine and tundra environments.</p>
<p>Its low-growing structure and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects.</p>
