<p>Antherura, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often bioluminescent petals that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant's flowers open only under specific environmental conditions, such as high humidity and cool temperatures, making it a subject of scientific curiosity. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
