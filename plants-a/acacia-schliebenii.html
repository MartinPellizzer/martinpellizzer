                    <h1>Acacia schliebenii</h1>
<p>Acacia schliebenii, commonly known as the Schlieben's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a capacity to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria.</p>
<p>Acacia schliebenii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various animals.</p>
