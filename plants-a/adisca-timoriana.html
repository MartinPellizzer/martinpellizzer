<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and erect.</p>
<p>Adisca timoriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adisca timoriana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, pale green bark, and exhibits a creeping growth pattern along the ground. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in the moist, tropical soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adisca timoriana is primarily native to the island of Timor, specifically in the eastern part of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is found in the humid lowland forests and mountainous regions of East Nusa Tenggara. This plant thrives in tropical climates with high rainfall and warm temperatures. It is often seen growing in shaded, moist environments within its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Adisca timoriana is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adisca timoriana was mainly introduced to enhance biodiversity in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. This plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily due to horticultural interest and ecological adaptation to humid climates.</p>
