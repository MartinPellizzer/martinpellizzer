                <h1>Acer tonkinense subsp. kwangsiense</h1>
<p>Acer tonkinense subsp.</p>
<p>kwangsiense, commonly known as the Guangxi maple, is a deciduous tree native to China, particularly in the Guangxi region. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red samaras as its fruit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental leaves and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tonkinense subsp.</p>
<p>kwangsiense has alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, and are typically 5â€“10 cm in length, arranged singly along the stem. The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, turning yellow or red in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree with a rounded crown. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in cymes, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tonkinense subsp.</p>
<p>kwangsiense is a rare evergreen tree native to southern China, particularly in Guangxi and Guangdong provinces. Its current distribution is limited to fragmented areas within these regions, where it grows in moist, shaded forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid temperate climates with high rainfall and is typically found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to protect and restore its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tonkinense subsp.</p>
<p>kwangsiense is a unique maple species that thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires consistent watering during its growing season. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds needing stratification for better germination.</p>
<p>The growth cycle of this plant includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in late summer and dormancy in winter. Regular fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or scale insects, and companion planting with ferns or rhododendrons can enhance its growth and aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tonkinense subsp.</p>
<p>kwangsiense is a native plant species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its flowers, contributing to the local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in nutrient cycling by improving soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tonkinense subsp.</p>
<p>kwangsiense is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It is occasionally used in local crafts and as ornamental planting due to its attractive foliage, contributing to ecological and economic benefits in certain regions.</p>
<p>While not widely industrialized, its wood may have niche applications in small-scale woodworking. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some Asian communities, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and traditional than commercial, highlighting the importance of conserving plant biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tonkinense subsp.</p>
<p>kwangsiense has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Coral Bark' and 'Dawn Star,' which are known for their striking red bark and vibrant autumn foliage. The species has also been used in hybridization with other maple species to produce cultivars with enhanced traits such as improved cold hardiness and unique leaf colors.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit greater adaptability to different climates, making them more versatile for horticultural use. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to add visual interest to gardens with its seasonal color changes and architectural form.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal and relative ease of cultivation, it remains a valuable addition to both public and private landscapes.</p>
