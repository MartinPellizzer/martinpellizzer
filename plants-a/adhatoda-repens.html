                <h1>Adhatoda repens</h1>
<p>Adhatoda repens, commonly known as the creeping adhatoda, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Adhatoda repens is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional medicine systems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda repens has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green to brownish color, and it grows in a trailing or ascending pattern. The flowers are small, tubular, and borne in clusters, usually pink to purple in color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda repens is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed in tropical and subtropical areas around the world, often found in cultivated gardens and disturbed habitats. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in open forests, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adhatoda repens is generally not considered threatened and is listed as of least concern by the IUCN, though local populations may be affected by habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda repens is a tropical plant known for its medicinal properties and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or root division, with stem cuttings being the most effective method. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to promote bushy growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adhatoda repens is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also attracts birds and small mammals that feed on its seeds, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain agricultural systems, helping to enhance the growth of neighboring crops. Additionally, its dense foliage helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Adhatoda repens also plays a role in improving soil health by fixing nitrogen, making it beneficial for sustainable land management.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adhatoda repens is a versatile plant known for its various uses across different fields.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it is used to treat respiratory conditions such as asthma and bronchitis due to its bronchodilatory properties.
