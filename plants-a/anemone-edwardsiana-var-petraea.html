                    <h1>Anemone edwardsiana var. petraea</h1>
<p>Anemone edwardsiana var. petraea, commonly known as the Edgeworth's anemone, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, nodding white flowers with a distinctive red center, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species of alpine ecosystems.</p>
