<p>Aristida acuta, commonly known as the acute grass or speargrass, is a perennial grass species native to the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Aristida acuta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
