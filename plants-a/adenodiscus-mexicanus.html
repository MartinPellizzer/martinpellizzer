                <h1>Adenodiscus mexicanus</h1>
<p>Adenodiscus mexicanus, commonly known as Mexican spiderflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are ovate and have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Adenodiscus mexicanus thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and open areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenodiscus mexicanus has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and exhibits a light green to brownish color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal spikes, with white or pale pink petals, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodiscus mexicanus is primarily native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with warm, tropical climates. This plant thrives in open woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is particularly prevalent in the southern parts of Mexico, including the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Veracruz.</p>
<p>Adenodiscus mexicanus is also known to grow in parts of northern South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodiscus mexicanus was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Florida, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It has since spread into nearby regions, including parts of Arizona and California, where it has established itself in disturbed habitats and along roadsides. This distribution is largely the result of its ability to thrive in dry, sunny conditions and its resistance to drought. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among land managers due to its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
