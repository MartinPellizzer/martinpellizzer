                    <h1>Abies balsamea var. nana</h1>
<p>Abies balsamea var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf balsam fir, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green needles that are shorter and more clustered than those of the standard balsam fir. The plant produces small, spherical cones that release seeds in the spring, contributing to its reproductive cycle. Its slow growth rate and low stature make it well-suited for rock gardens and woodland settings.</p>
<p>The foliage retains its color year-round, providing evergreen interest in shaded landscapes.</p>
