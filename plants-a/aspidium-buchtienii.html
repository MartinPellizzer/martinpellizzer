<p>Aspidium buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtien's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
