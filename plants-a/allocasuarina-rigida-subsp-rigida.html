<p>Allocasuarina rigida subsp.</p>
<p>rigida, commonly known as the rigid sheoak, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed around the stems, giving it a unique appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody cones and are dispersed by wind after maturation.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments.</p>
