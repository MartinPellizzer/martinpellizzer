<p>Atenia howellii, commonly known as the Howell's atenia, is a rare and specialized plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth form. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are typically tubular and come in shades of red or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Atenia howellii is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
