                <h1>Acrostichum hyperboreum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum hyperboreum, commonly known as the northern fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Acrostichum hyperboreum plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its cold, nutrient-poor ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hyperboreum has large, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are sturdy and have a rough, fibrous texture, growing upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind after maturity.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hyperboreum is primarily native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of northern Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas and wetlands, often found in the tundra and boreal zones. This plant is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate saline and waterlogged soils. It is commonly associated with rocky shores and is a characteristic species of the Arctic flora.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to the northernmost parts of the Northern Hemisphere where conditions are suitable for its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hyperboreum was mainly introduced to coastal areas with high salinity and sandy soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where other plant species struggle due to its salt tolerance. This plant is commonly found in regions with a temperate climate and moderate to high rainfall. Its introduction has been noted in several coastal regions of the United States and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its requirement for well-drained soil and exposure to sea breezes.</p>
