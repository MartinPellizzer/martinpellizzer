<p>Acrostichum hyperboreum, commonly known as the northern fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Acrostichum hyperboreum plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its cold, nutrient-poor ecosystems.</p>
