<p>Aulonemia cincta, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are often clustered at the base, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white.</p>
<p>Aulonemia cincta is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to trap and digest small aquatic organisms.</p>
