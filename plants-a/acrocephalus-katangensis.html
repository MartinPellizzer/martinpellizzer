<p>Acrocephalus katangensis, commonly known as the Katanga reed warbler, is a small passerine bird native to Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sylviidae and is characterized by its slender body and distinctive plumage. The plant, however, is not a botanical species but a bird species, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. If you were referring to a plant, please provide the correct name.</p>
