<p>Abarema callejasii, commonly known as the Brazilian peacock flower, is a strikingly beautiful plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Leguminosae family, which includes legumes and beans, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy flowers. The plant produces intricate, butterfly-like flowers in shades of pink and white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abarema callejasii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly rough texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, featuring yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema callejasii is a rare plant species native to the Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations within the state of Esp√≠rito Santo. It thrives in humid, shaded understory environments of tropical rainforests. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 300 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Abarema callejasii is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>
