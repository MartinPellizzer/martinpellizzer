<p>Abarema cuneadena, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burr legume, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, woody pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through the action of the pod's elasticity.</p>
