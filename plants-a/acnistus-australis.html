                <h1>Acnistus australis</h1>
<p>Acnistus australis, commonly known as the Australian starfruit or sandmat, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, hard seeds.</p>
<p>Acnistus australis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus australis has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually bright green and slightly hairy, with a smooth margin.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, somewhat woody, and have a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, consisting of small, white or pale yellow blooms that appear in spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus australis is primarily native to eastern and southern Australia, including regions such as Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats like grasslands, woodlands, and rocky outcrops. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in coastal and inland areas with a temperate climate. It is an erect shrub that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, featuring small, oval leaves and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Acnistus australis is adapted to withstand drought and is an important component of the local flora in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus australis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant competes with native species for resources and can alter habitat structure.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the risks associated with non-native plant species in ecological systems.</p>
