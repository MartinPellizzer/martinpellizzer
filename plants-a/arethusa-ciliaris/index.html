                            <h1>Arethusa Ciliaris</h1>
<p>Arethusa ciliaris, also known as the water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats across northern regions. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often associated with marshes and pond edges. The plant's unique appearance features delicate, star-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
