                <h1>Acianthera erinacea</h1>
<p>Acianthera erinacea, commonly known as the hairy acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually elongated and covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Acianthera erinacea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera erinacea has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and a yellowish throat, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, black seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in loose, moist soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera erinacea is primarily native to Belize, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, Panam√°, Peru, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This orchid species is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid environments such as rainforests and cloud forests. It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant is known for its delicate, fragrant flowers and is commonly found in shaded understory habitats.</p>
<p>Its wide native distribution spans several South American and Central American countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera erinacea was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was primarily spread through human activities such as gardening and horticultural trade. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it common in forested areas and along stream banks. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>However, current research suggests it has not become invasive in the region.</p>
