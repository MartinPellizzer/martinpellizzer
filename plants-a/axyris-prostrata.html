The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often covered in a thick layer of bark, providing protection against drought and herbivory.</p>
<p>Axyris prostrata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
