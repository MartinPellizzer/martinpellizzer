                    <h1>Angraecum rigidifolium</h1>
<p>Angraecum rigidifolium, commonly known as the rigid-leaved star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rigid, upright leaves and long, pendulous inflorescences that bear fragrant, star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale blue, are adapted for pollination by specific nocturnal moths.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Angraecum rigidifolium is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings.</p>
