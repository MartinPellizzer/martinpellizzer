<p>Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum × paniculatum f. grossidens has large, compound leaves that are broadly ovate to kidney-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to violet in color, with spicate inflorescences, blooming in late summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum × paniculatum f. grossidens is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, particularly in areas of the Alps and Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America and parts of Asia, often as an ornamental. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and rocky slopes, typically at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted natural habitat and potential over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions, though its conservation status varies by locality.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum × paniculatum f. grossidens is a striking perennial known for its showy blue or purple flowers and tall, upright growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of rhizomes, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This plant has a cool season growth cycle, thriving in early spring with active growth and flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, moist soil and regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its vigor, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with grasses or shrubs can enhance its ornamental appeal and provide support for its tall stems.</p>
