<p>Astephanus linearis, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
