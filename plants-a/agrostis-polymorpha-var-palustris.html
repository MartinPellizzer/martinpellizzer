                    <h1>Agrostis polymorpha var. palustris</h1>
<p>Agrostis polymorpha var. palustris, commonly known as marsh bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is well adapted to waterlogged conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland environments.</p>
