                    <h1>Acacia bullockii</h1>
<p>Acacia bullockii, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow flowers and bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Acacia bullockii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
