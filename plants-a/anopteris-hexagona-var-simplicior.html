<p>Anopteris hexagona var. simplicior, commonly known as the Japanese male fern, is a fern species native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in botanical studies.</p>
