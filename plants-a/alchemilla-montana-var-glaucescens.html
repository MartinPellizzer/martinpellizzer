                    <h1>Alchemilla montana var. glaucescens</h1>
<p>Alchemilla montana var. glaucescens, commonly known as the blue alchemilla, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, silver-gray leaves that reflect light and give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in loose clusters atop the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate wet conditions.</p>
