<p>Actinea acaulis var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly star, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its flowers are small and clustered in a star-like pattern, often appearing in late summer.</p>
<p>The variety lanata is distinguished by its more pronounced and dense pubescence compared to the typical form of Actinea acaulis.</p>
