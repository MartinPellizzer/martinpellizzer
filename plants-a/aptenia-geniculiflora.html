                    <h1>Aptenia geniculiflora</h1>
<p>Aptenia geniculiflora, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, depending on the variety. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is often used as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
