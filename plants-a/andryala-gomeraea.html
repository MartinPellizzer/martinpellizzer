                    <h1>Andryala gomeraea</h1>
<p>Andryala gomeraea, commonly known as the Gomera bellflower, is an endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of La Gomera in the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
