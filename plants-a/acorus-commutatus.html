                <h1>Acorus commutatus</h1>
<p>Acorus commutatus, commonly known as narrow-leaved sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating at the water's surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spadix, surrounded by a leaf-like bract. Acorus commutatus is adapted to aquatic environments and has rhizomatous growth that helps it spread and stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus commutatus has long, narrow leaves that are sword-shaped, arranged in a rosette, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright from the base. It produces small, spadix-like flowers that are usually greenish-yellow, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark, berry-like structure containing multiple seeds, which are dispersed by water or animals.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus commutatus is primarily native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments and is often associated with slow-moving or still water bodies. It is also present in some regions of Southeast Asia, such as Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Acorus commutatus is an important component of riparian and wetland ecosystems in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus commutatus was mainly introduced to aquatic and wetland environments where it can thrive in shallow water or moist soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams and rivers. This plant is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive, sword-like leaves. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its distribution is influenced by water availability and soil conditions, making it adaptable to a variety of wetland habitats.</p>
