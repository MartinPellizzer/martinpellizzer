                <h1>Acorus commutatus</h1>
<p>Acorus commutatus, commonly known as narrowleaf sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshes in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, yellowish-green spathes that enclose its spores, which are dispersed by wind. Acorus commutatus thrives in shallow water and is often found in still or slow-moving water bodies.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus commutatus has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a helical pattern along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows monostichously. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the axils of the leaves, with greenish-yellow petals and a spadix, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are rhizomatous, forming dense underground networks that help anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the wet soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus commutatus is a wetland plant native to Asia, particularly found in regions such as China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is now distributed across parts of Europe, North America, and Australia, often introduced through horticultural trade. This plant thrives in freshwater environments like marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Acorus commutatus is generally not considered threatened, but local populations may be vulnerable due to habitat loss and water pollution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acorus commutatus is a hardy aquatic plant commonly used in wetland restoration and ornamental pond settings.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through rhizome division or by planting rhizomes in shallow water or moist soil. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in rich, organic soil with consistent moisture, requiring regular watering to maintain wet conditions. Fertilization with a balanced aquatic fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning dead foliage helps maintain its appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with slugs or snails.</p>
<p>Companion planting with water lilies or cattails can enhance its ecological benefits in wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acorus commutatus is a wetland plant that provides food and shelter for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as beetles and flies, which aid in its reproduction. The plant acts as a natural filter, helping to improve water quality by absorbing pollutants. Its dense growth also helps prevent soil erosion in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acorus commutatus supports biodiversity by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of wildlife.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acorus commutatus is a versatile plant with various uses and applications across different fields.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, it is occasionally used as a spice or flavoring agent in traditional dishes. Medicinally, it has been utilized in traditional medicine for its potential antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, its rhizomes are used in the production of certain organic compounds.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some regions and is sometimes associated with purification and spiritual practices.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acorus commutatus has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aureus', which features golden-yellow foliage, and 'Variegatus', known for its striking variegated leaves. Hybrids of A. commutatus are often created to enhance leaf color, texture, and hardiness, making them more adaptable to different garden conditions. These plants hold horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in wet environments and their aesthetic appeal in water gardens and bog landscapes.</p>
<p>Their versatility and visual interest make them a favored choice among landscape designers and gardeners.</p>
