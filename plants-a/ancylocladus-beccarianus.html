<p>Ancylocladus beccarianus, commonly known as the Bornean yew, is a rare evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cupressaceae, which includes other coniferous trees. The plant is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and small, scale-like leaves. It produces unique, woody cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, red aril.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation.</p>
