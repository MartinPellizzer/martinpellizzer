                    <h1>Aspidium procurrens</h1>
<p>Aspidium procurrens, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, lanceolate pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium.</p>
