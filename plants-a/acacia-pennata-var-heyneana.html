<p>Acacia pennata var. heyneana, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and bipinnate leaves composed of small, feather-like leaflets. The plant produces yellow to golden-orange globular flowers that bloom in late summer to autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Acacia pennata var. heyneana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia pennata var. heyneana has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, oval leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern, and they are typically green with a slight reddish tinge.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, often branching, with a smooth, pale gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are yellow and clustered in spikes, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a flattened, pod-like structure containing small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to access water in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia pennata var. heyneana is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries such as Sudan, Eritrea, and parts of East Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas of southern Sudan and the Red Sea coastal regions, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. This species is found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, Acacia pennata var. heyneana is considered to be in a vulnerable conservation status.</p>
