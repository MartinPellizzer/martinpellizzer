                        <h1>Abies delavayi var. smithii</h1>
<p>Abies delavayi var. smithii, commonly known as the Smith's fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of southwestern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of its relatives. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and it is adapted to cold, moist environments with poor soil conditions. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
