                    <h1>Athyrium × decurrentiserratum</h1>
<p>Athyrium × decurrentiserratum, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium capillus-veneris.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elegant, delicate fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that combines features from both parent species. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its attractive foliage.</p>
