                    <h1>Aegialinites rotundifolius</h1>
<p>Aegialinites rotundifolius, commonly known as the rounded-leaf sea clubmoss, is a fossilized plant that belongs to the Lepidodendrales order.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded leaves and is often found in coal-bearing rock formations from the Carboniferous period. This plant was a dominant species in ancient swamp ecosystems, contributing to the formation of coal through its dense growth and rapid decomposition. Its structure suggests it was a vascular plant with a complex root system and branching stems.</p>
<p>The fossilized remains provide valuable insights into the paleobotany and environmental conditions of the Carboniferous era.</p>
