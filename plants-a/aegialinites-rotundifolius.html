                <h1>Aegialinites rotundifolius</h1>
<p>Aegialinites rotundifolius, commonly known as the rounded-leaf sea clubmoss, is a fossilized plant that belongs to the Lepidodendrales order.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded leaves and is often found in coal-bearing rock formations from the Carboniferous period. This plant was a dominant species in ancient swamp ecosystems, contributing to the formation of coal through its dense growth and rapid decomposition. Its structure suggests it was a vascular plant with a complex root system and branching stems.</p>
<p>The fossilized remains provide valuable insights into the paleobotany and environmental conditions of the Carboniferous era.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegialinites rotundifolius has leaves that are round or broadly oval in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in diameter, and a dark green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical with a smooth, light brown bark, and it grows in a climbing or trailing pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>
