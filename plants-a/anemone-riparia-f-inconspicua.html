<p>Anemone riparia f. inconspicua, commonly known as the river anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, rocky stream banks in North America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires consistently moist soil.</p>
