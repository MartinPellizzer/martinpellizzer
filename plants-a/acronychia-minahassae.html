                <h1>Acronychia minahassae</h1>
<p>Acronychia minahassae, commonly known as the Minahassa acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Indonesia, specifically found in the provinces of South Sulawesi and Southeast Sulawesi. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, producing a unique aromatic scent that attracts pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia minahassae has compound leaves that are pinnate, with elongated, lanceolate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring four petals and stamens, and bloom during the dry season, likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe with a hard outer shell, containing one or two seeds that are dispersed by animals feeding on the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and anchoring the plant in rocky or coastal habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia minahassae is primarily native to the Philippines, specifically found in the island of Mindanao.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and montane forests, often growing in shaded, humid environments. This species is typically associated with secondary growth and disturbed areas within its native range. It is a small to medium-sized tree that plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia minahassae was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. Its introduction has been primarily due to its ornamental value and adaptability to cultivated environments.</p>
<p>However, it is not commonly cultivated outside its native range.</p>
