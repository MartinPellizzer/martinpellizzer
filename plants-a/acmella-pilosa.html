                <h1>Acmella pilosa</h1>
<p>Acmella pilosa, commonly known as the spiny hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny calyces that enclose its showy yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are ovate and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Acmella pilosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella pilosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a pale green to brownish bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are small, yellow with a red center, and are clustered in inflorescences; they bloom during the dry season and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella pilosa is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil and Paraguay.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in the Amazon Basin, its current distribution is limited and scattered due to habitat loss. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, often growing in shallow water. It is typically found at low altitudes, usually below 300 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from land conversion, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella pilosa is a flowering plant known for its vibrant orange flowers and compact growth habit, often used in ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. The growth cycle of Acmella pilosa is relatively short, with flowering occurring within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage new growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by aphids and root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmella pilosa is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and insects, due to its bright colors and abundant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other species to enhance soil health and biodiversity. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its fibrous root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acmella pilosa contributes to ecological benefits by supporting pollinator populations and maintaining the balance of local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acmella pilosa is a versatile plant known for its culinary uses, particularly in traditional dishes where its leaves are used as a vegetable.</p>
<p>It also has medicinal applications, with its extracts used in folk remedies to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions. Industrially, it contributes to local economies through agriculture and trade, supporting small-scale farmers. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some regions, representing resilience and natural abundance.</p>
<p>Overall, Acmella pilosa plays a multifaceted role in both ecological and human contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acmella pilosa has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their vibrant colors and compact growth habit, with popular cultivars such as 'Ballerina' and 'Crimson Star' being widely used in garden settings.</p>
<p>While there are limited naturally occurring hybrids, horticulturalists have developed several hybrid forms to enhance traits like flower size and color longevity. These hybrids often exhibit improved resistance to diseases and better adaptability to different climates. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ornamental value, making it a popular choice for borders, containers, and floral arrangements.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in various growing conditions further contributes to its appeal among gardeners and landscapers.</p>
