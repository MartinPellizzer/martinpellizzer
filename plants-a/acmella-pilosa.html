                <h1>Acmella pilosa</h1>
<p>Acmella pilosa, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinct appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands.</p>
<p>Acmella pilosa is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella pilosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dull green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, bark-like texture, and has a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, yellow with a prominent central dark spot, and bloom during the summer months; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in the understory of forests. Acmella pilosa is known for its small, colorful flowers and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the specific ecological conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella pilosa was mainly introduced to Florida.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to South America but has been spread to other regions, including Florida, likely through human activity. This species is known for its bright yellow flowers and is often found in wetland areas. Its introduction to Florida has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
