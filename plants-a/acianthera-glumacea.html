                <h1>Acianthera glumacea</h1>
<p>Acianthera glumacea, commonly known as the glume orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, showy flowers that often feature a unique combination of colors. The plant typically produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers arranged in a spike, which can bloom during the warmer months. Acianthera glumacea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and ecological studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera glumacea has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and exhibits a creeping growth pattern, with a light green color and a slightly rough texture. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white or pale pink petals and a prominent, three-lobed lip, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera glumacea is primarily native to Brazil South and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, where it thrives in humid and tropical environments. It typically grows in shaded understory areas of dense forests, often on tree trunks or branches. The plant is known for its small, delicate flowers and is part of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera glumacea was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in environments with partial to full sunlight and is often seen in secondary vegetation. Its introduction has been noted in several countries across Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become a common ornamental and sometimes invasive species in these regions.</p>
