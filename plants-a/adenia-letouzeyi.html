                <h1>Adenia letouzeyi</h1>
<p>Adenia letouzeyi, commonly known as the African star apple, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-colored berry that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Adenia letouzeyi is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some African cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia letouzeyi has compound, pinnate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are large, showy, and borne in clusters, with a white to pale yellow color, five petals, and a distinct, hairy throat, blooming from September to November and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, yellow or orange berry that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by animals eating the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia letouzeyi is primarily native to Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, DR Congo, and Gabon.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of these regions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the dense canopy of the forest. Adenia letouzeyi is commonly found in lowland and mountainous areas across its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic locations in Central and West Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia letouzeyi was mainly introduced to gardens and botanical collections in Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, waxy leaves and unique flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. It is often used in shaded or semi-shaded areas of landscapes.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it may spread aggressively if not properly managed.</p>
