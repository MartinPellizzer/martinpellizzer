                <h1>Acidosasa guangxiensis</h1>
<p>Acidosasa guangxiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi acid vine, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Guangxi region of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and distinctive yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red when ripe, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acidosasa guangxiensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidosasa guangxiensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slightly fibrous texture. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical berry that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidosasa guangxiensis is primarily native to China Southeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of China, particularly in Guangxi Province. This plant thrives in humid, subtropical climates with abundant rainfall. It is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidosasa guangxiensis was mainly introduced to regions with high humidity and acidic soils, particularly in southern China and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates where temperatures remain consistently warm. This plant is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas due to its unique characteristics. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes and ecological research.</p>
<p>However, its natural distribution remains limited to its native habitat in Guangxi, China.</p>
