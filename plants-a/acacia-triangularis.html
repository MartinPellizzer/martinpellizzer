                    <h1>Acacia triangularis</h1>
<p>Acacia triangularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, triangular-shaped leaves and yellow, spherical flower heads that appear in spring. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often used in reforestation projects due to its hardiness.</p>
<p>The seeds of Acacia triangularis are encased in a hard pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread.</p>
