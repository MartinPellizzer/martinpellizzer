                        <h1>Acacia triangularis</h1>
<p>Acacia triangularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, triangular-shaped leaves and yellow, spherical flower heads that appear in spring. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often used in reforestation projects due to its hardiness.</p>
<p>The seeds of Acacia triangularis are encased in a hard pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>

<p>It is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and woodlands. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with coastal and inland areas. It is also known as the coastal wattle due to its frequent occurrence along the coastline.</p>
<p>Acacia triangularis is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia triangularis was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a temperate to warm climate, often found in regions with moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>It thrives in open landscapes such as grasslands, woodlands, and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for reforestation and land rehabilitation projects.</p>
