                        <h1>Acantholimon melananthum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon melananthum, commonly known as the black-flowered acantholimon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, with a distinctive blackish hue at the base. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon melananthum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants that include ferns and their allies, often featuring jointed stems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many primitive angiosperms with a wide range of morphological diversity.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants with specialized adaptations such as salt tolerance and a variety of growth forms. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, commonly known as the leadwort family, which consists of herbaceous plants often found in arid or saline environments. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically characterized by their succulent leaves and showy flowers, often found in rocky or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon melananthum, a specific plant within the genus Acantholimon that is known for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon melananthum is primarily native to Iran.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. It is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>It is often seen in mountainous and coastal areas of Iran.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon melananthum was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silvery foliage and flowering habit.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several areas, particularly in southern Europe and parts of North Africa. The plant is often found growing in rocky soils and dry habitats, where it thrives in full sun. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to invade native ecosystems and compete with local flora.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered a non-native species that requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
