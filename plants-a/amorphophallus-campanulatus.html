                    <h1>Amorphophallus campanulatus</h1>
<p>Amorphophallus campanulatus, commonly known as the bell amorphophallus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped inflorescence that resembles a large, purple flower. The plant produces a single, large, white or pink flower that opens in the evening and emits a strong, unpleasant odor to attract its primary pollinators, carrion beetles. It has a tuberous root system that allows it to store nutrients and survive periods of drought.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
