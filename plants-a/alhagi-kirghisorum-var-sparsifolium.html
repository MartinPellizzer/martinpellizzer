                    <h1>Alhagi kirghisorum var. sparsifolium</h1>
<p>Alhagi kirghisorum var. sparsifolium, commonly known as the sparse-leaved arrowhead, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It is often found in steppes and desert margins, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its low-growing habit and resilience make it an important species for ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
