<p>Aphanostephus pilosus, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy soils with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Aphanostephus pilosus is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
