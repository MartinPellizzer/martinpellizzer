                <h1>Acetosa sanguinea</h1>
<p>Acetosa sanguinea, commonly known as red sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features small, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters. Its leaves are typically succulent and covered in a waxy layer to retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Acetosa sanguinea is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acetosa sanguinea has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat woody at the base, and has a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense umbels, with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acetosa sanguinea is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, where it has been introduced and sometimes naturalized. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments, often growing on slopes and in meadows. Acetosa sanguinea is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acetosa sanguinea is a flowering plant known for its striking red blooms and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with division being more reliable for maintaining the plant's characteristics. The growth cycle of Acetosa sanguinea includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in late summer, and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally be affected by aphids or root rot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
