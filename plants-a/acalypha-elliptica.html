Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises a group of vascular plants that includes horsetails and their relatives, known for their primitive features. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is characterized by diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large and diverse group of flowering plants that includes many tropical and subtropical species with varied morphological features. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes a wide variety of plants, many of which have milky sap and are often used in traditional medicine. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as the "velvetleaf" or "cupseed" plants, which are often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
