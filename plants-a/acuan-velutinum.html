                <h1>Acuan velutinum</h1>
<p>Acuan velutinum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Acuan velutinum is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acuan velutinum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a velvety texture and a deep green color on the upper surface, and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a light green to pale yellow bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branched pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan velutinum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments like forests and along riverbanks. The plant is commonly associated with wetlands and areas with high humidity. It is also present in parts of Australia and New Guinea.</p>
<p>Acuan velutinum plays an important role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan velutinum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads rapidly through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among local conservationists due to its potential impact on ecosystem balance.</p>
