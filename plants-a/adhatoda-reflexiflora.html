                <h1>Adhatoda reflexiflora</h1>
<p>Adhatoda reflexiflora, commonly known as the Indian borage, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy and have a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda reflexiflora has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically medium-sized, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, erect, and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, featuring tubular corollas with five lobes, and are typically blue or violet in color, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, often forming a dense network near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda reflexiflora is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, Vietnam, and parts of Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates and is typically associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also occasionally found in India and Indonesia, where it has been introduced or occurs naturally in specific areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to regions with high rainfall and warm temperatures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda reflexiflora was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like India, Thailand, and Indonesia. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive leaves and flowers. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
