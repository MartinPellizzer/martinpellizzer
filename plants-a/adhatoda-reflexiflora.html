<p>Adhatoda reflexiflora, commonly known as the Indian Trumpet or Malabar Trumpet, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive trumpet-shaped flowers, which are typically blue or violet in color. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins, and it produces small, elongated fruits. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Adhatoda reflexiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda reflexiflora has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exudes a mild aromatic scent. Its flowers are trumpet-shaped, typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda reflexiflora is a rare and unique plant native to the Western Ghats of India, particularly in the states of Kerala and Karnataka.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of South Asia, including Sri Lanka and parts of Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as tropical forests and undergrowth, typically found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda reflexiflora is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>
