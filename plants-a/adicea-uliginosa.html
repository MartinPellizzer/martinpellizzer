                <h1>Adicea uliginosa</h1>
<p>Adicea uliginosa, commonly known as the bog gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and bog environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are clustered in whorls along the stem. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and heathlands.</p>
<p>Adicea uliginosa is an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting various pollinators and contributing to biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea uliginosa has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a smooth, sometimes slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is short and often hidden beneath the leaves, with a fibrous, light brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, usually greenish-white in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and colonize wet, muddy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea uliginosa is primarily native to wetland areas of Europe, particularly in the British Isles, Scandinavia, and parts of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is commonly found in peat bogs, fens, and other wetland habitats. This plant is well adapted to waterlogged conditions and plays an important ecological role in these environments. It is often associated with calcareous soils and is sometimes found in association with other wetland flora.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species for certain wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea uliginosa was mainly introduced to wetland and marshy areas where it can thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in regions with high water tables, such as along riverbanks, lakeshores, and flooded meadows. This plant has become established in various parts of Europe and North America due to its adaptability to different aquatic environments. Its introduction has sometimes led to changes in local ecosystems, affecting native plant species.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, Adicea uliginosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for certain aquatic organisms.</p>
