                <h1>Acmena hemilampra</h1>
<p>Acmena hemilampra, commonly known as the broad-leaved tallowwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a dense, spreading canopy.</p>
<p>Acmena hemilampra is valued for its hard, durable timber and is often used in construction and furniture making.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena hemilampra has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a dense, bushy habit. Its small white flowers are clustered in umbels, bloom during the spring season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena hemilampra is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically the coastal regions of New South Wales and southern Queensland.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid subtropical climates and is commonly found in rainforests and adjacent moist forests. This plant is often associated with limestone soils and can be seen growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded understorey environments. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a regionally significant species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena hemilampra was mainly introduced to urban and suburban landscapes for its ornamental value, particularly its attractive foliage and flowering habits.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides in regions with a subtropical to tropical climate. The plant has been reported in several states across Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. Due to its adaptability and rapid growth, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists regarding its impact on native plant communities.</p>
