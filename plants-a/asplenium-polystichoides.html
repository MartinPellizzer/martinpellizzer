                    <h1>Asplenium polystichoides</h1>
<p>Asplenium polystichoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on limestone or granite substrates. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with fronds that are deeply divided and resemble those of other asplenium species. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in moist, shaded conditions.</p>
