                <h1>Aechmea caerulea</h1>
<p>Aechmea caerulea, commonly known as the blue haw, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its flowering structure. The plant produces vibrant blue or purple inflorescences that bloom for several months, adding ornamental value to gardens. Its foliage is often adorned with white or silver markings, enhancing its visual appeal.</p>
<p>Aechmea caerulea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea caerulea has leaves that are strap-shaped, arranged in a rosette, and can grow up to 60 cm in length, with a bluish-green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, stout stem that is often hidden beneath the leaves, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark. Its flowers are spike-like, with bright red bracts and small white to yellowish flowers, blooming in the spring to early summer, and are pollinated by birds and insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its natural habitat.</p>
