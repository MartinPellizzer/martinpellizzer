<p>Abies guatemalensis var. ixtepejiensis, commonly known as the Ixtepejiensis fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to high-altitude regions of Guatemala.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a flat, spreading pattern. The tree produces small, rounded cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
