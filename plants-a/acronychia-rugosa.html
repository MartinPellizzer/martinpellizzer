                <h1>Acronychia rugosa</h1>
<p>Acronychia rugosa, commonly known as the rough acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal and lowland rainforest habitats. The plant is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dark green,革质 (leathery) leaves. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Acronychia rugosa is often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia rugosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green upper surface and a pale underside, and they are typically 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is dark brown to grey in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody drupe, containing one or two seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, often forming a dense network in the understory of tropical forests.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia rugosa is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in the northern and eastern regions. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments along riverbanks and in coastal areas. Acronychia rugosa is part of the Burseraceae family and is known for its distinctive bark and foliage.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the highland and lowland forests of New Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia rugosa was mainly introduced to urban and coastal areas for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens, parks, and along roadsides where it can tolerate moderate shade and varying soil conditions. The plant's rapid growth and dense foliage make it a popular choice for erosion control and landscaping. However, it has also been noted to spread aggressively, sometimes becoming invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities in non-native regions.</p>
