<p>Athyrium wardii var. majus, commonly known as the giant lady fern, is a striking fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length, making it one of the tallest ferns in its native habitat. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical forests. Its fronds are dark green and have a distinctive, elegant appearance with finely divided segments.</p>
