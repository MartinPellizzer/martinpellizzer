<p>Adiantum kaulfussii var. platyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a strikingly ornamental fern native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are broad and slightly wavy, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, bright green spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its elegant foliage and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
