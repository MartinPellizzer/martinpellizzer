<p>Aristida glabrata, commonly known as the smooth beardgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence consists of numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers.</p>
<p>Aristida glabrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
