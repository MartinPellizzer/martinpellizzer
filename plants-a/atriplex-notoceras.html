                    <h1>Atriplex notoceras</h1>
<p>Atriplex notoceras, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, a feature typical of xerophytic plants. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils and coastal environments.</p>
<p>Atriplex notoceras plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert species.</p>
