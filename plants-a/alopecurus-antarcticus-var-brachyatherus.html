                    <h1>Alopecurus antarcticus var. brachyatherus</h1>
<p>Alopecurus antarcticus var. brachyatherus, commonly known as the Antarctic meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, which are adapted to pollination by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subantarctic regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
