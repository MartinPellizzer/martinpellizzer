<p>Acacia nuperrima subsp.</p>
<p>cassitera, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are often silvery-white in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that appear in late winter to early spring. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in coastal regions. Acacia nuperrima subsp.</p>
<p>cassitera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia nuperrima subsp.</p>
<p>cassitera has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern, giving the plant a delicate appearance. The leaves are typically green, with a slightly pubescent surface, and they are alternate in arrangement along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are slender and woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are yellow and form cylindrical inflorescences, blooming during the cooler months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their small size and light weight.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia nuperrima subsp.</p>
<p>cassitera is a shrub native to southern Africa, specifically found in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. Its current distribution includes semi-arid to arid regions, particularly in the western and southwestern parts of these countries.</p>
<p>It thrives in open grasslands, rocky outcrops, and sandy soils, often in areas with low rainfall. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is considered vulnerable, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia nuperrima subsp.</p>
<p>cassitera is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to southern Africa, known for its striking yellow flowers and feathery foliage. It can be propagated through seed sowing or cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for optimal germination.</p>
<p>The plant grows best in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal watering once established. Fertilize it sparingly with a balanced fertilizer in spring, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
