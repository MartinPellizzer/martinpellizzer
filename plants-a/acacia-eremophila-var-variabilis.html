                        <h1>Acacia eremophila var. variabilis</h1>
<p>Acacia eremophila var. variabilis, commonly known as the variable acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep root systems and waxy foliage to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value in drought-prone areas.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia eremophila var. variabilis belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes horsetails and some fern allies, known for their primitive features. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by their complex flower structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which includes plants with showy flowers and often symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities through root nodules. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees found mainly in tropical and subtropical regions, known for their compound leaves and often thorny structures.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia eremophila, a specific type of acacia known for its adaptation to arid environments and its variability in form, with the varietal name variabilis indicating this morphological diversity.</p>
