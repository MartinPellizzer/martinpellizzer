                    <h1>Acacia eremophila var. variabilis</h1>
<p>Acacia eremophila var. variabilis, commonly known as the variable acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep root systems and waxy foliage to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value in drought-prone areas.</p>
