                    <h1>Astragalus melanotrichus</h1>
<p>Astragalus melanotrichus, commonly known as the black-haired milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, hairy leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Astragalus melanotrichus plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
