                    <h1>Agrostis stolonifera var. major</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonifera var. major, commonly known as Kentucky bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the northeastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It forms dense, sod-forming turf through the growth of stolons and rhizomes, which allow it to spread and establish thick mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that contain small, two-lobed florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is widely used in lawns and sports fields due to its durability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate moderate foot traffic makes it a popular choice for recreational areas.</p>
