<p>Abolboda poarchon, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
