                    <h1>Abrodictyum dregei</h1>
<p>Abrodictyum dregei, commonly known as the Cape golden orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with distinctive red veins, which bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, and it is adapted to withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable and sometimes endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
