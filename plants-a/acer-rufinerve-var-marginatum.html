                <h1>Acer rufinerve var. marginatum</h1>
<p>Acer rufinerve var. marginatum, commonly known as the red-veined maple with margins, is a variant of the red-veined maple characterized by its striking foliage.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a vibrant red or reddish-green coloration that stands out against the green veins. The plant is native to parts of eastern Asia, including China and Japan, where it thrives in temperate climates. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rufinerve var. marginatum has ovate to elliptical leaves that are finely toothed, arranged alternately along the stems, and typically measure 5-8 cm in length, with a vibrant green color that turns brilliant red in autumn.</p>
<p>The stems are smooth and reddish-brown, with a slender growth pattern that often forms a tree or shrub. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, with a wind pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rufinerve var. marginatum is a rare variant of the red-veined maple, native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of Europe and North America, primarily through horticultural trade. It thrives in temperate climates with moist, well-drained soils, typically found in forested areas and along stream banks. This species grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where it benefits from cooler temperatures and high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population size, it is considered endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rufinerve var. marginatum is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant red veins and colorful foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in about 5-10 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization in spring with a balanced fertilizer and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer rufinerve var. marginatum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through mutualistic relationships. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and protecting against water runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving soil quality and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer rufinerve var. marginatum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use due to its small, bitter fruits.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in traditional medicine, some indigenous communities may use its leaves or bark for minor health purposes. Its ornamental value makes it a potential candidate for horticultural and landscape design in certain regions. Due to its rarity, it has minimal industrial or economic impact.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local ecosystems or botanical studies, though its role is not well-documented.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer rufinerve var. marginatum has several popular cultivars, including 'Aconitifolium' and 'Sutherlandii', which are prized for their striking foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maples, leading to a variety of cultivars that exhibit enhanced traits such as improved cold hardiness and unique leaf patterns. These hybrids and cultivars are highly valued in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to different garden environments. Horticulturalists often select these varieties for their ability to thrive in diverse climates and their ability to add color and texture to landscapes.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer rufinerve var. marginatum plays a significant role in the ornamental horticulture industry.</p>
