                <h1>Adiantum denticulatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum denticulatum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and have a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are slender and often covered in a fine, white coating.</p>
<p>Adiantum denticulatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often used in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum denticulatum has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a feathery appearance, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green and glossy, with a delicate, translucent texture. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is smooth and green, growing in a creeping or upright manner depending on the environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish in color, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a club-shaped sorus containing numerous spores, and the plant disperses its spores through wind, rather than producing seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum denticulatum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks. This fern thrives in humid environments and is often seen growing along the edges of water bodies. It is also present in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into some regions of the Caribbean and southern United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum denticulatum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, delicate fronds and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant because of its low maintenance requirements. This fern is often used in landscaping to add a lush, green texture to shaded areas. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some regions beyond its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts.</p>
