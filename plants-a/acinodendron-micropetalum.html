                <h1>Acinodendron micropetalum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron micropetalum, commonly known as the small-petal acinodendron, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related trees, and is characterized by its unique leaf structure and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories, where it relies on specific ecological conditions for survival. Its botanical features, including its intricate floral morphology and specialized leaf arrangements, make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron micropetalum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exhibits a creeping growth pattern along the ground. Its flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in disturbed or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron micropetalum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often in humid and shaded environments. This plant typically grows in secondary forests and along the edges of primary forests, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become increasingly fragmented in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron micropetalum was mainly introduced to areas with high biodiversity and suitable climatic conditions, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has been documented in several countries in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as secondary forests, along roadsides, and in agricultural areas. Its introduction is likely due to human activities such as trade, horticulture, and accidental dispersal.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study, as it has not been widely reported as an invasive species.</p>
