                <h1>Adenocalymma involucratum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma involucratum, commonly known as the silky burr, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma involucratum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma involucratum has leaves that are simple, alternate, and ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 3 to 8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the cooler months of spring and early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma involucratum is primarily native to northern Australia, particularly in the tropical and subtropical regions of Queensland and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandplain and laterite soils, often in open woodlands and grasslands. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, hot climate of its native range. It is also occasionally seen in southern New Guinea.</p>
<p>The plant is well-known for its striking, showy flowers that bloom during the warmer months.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma involucratum was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or loamy soils in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high salinity, making it suitable for coastal dunes and salt marshes. This plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
