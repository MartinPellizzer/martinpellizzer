                <h1>Adenium obesum</h1>
<p>Adenium obesum, commonly known as the desert candle, is a succulent plant native to Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk and thick, fleshy leaves. The plant has a striking red or pink flower that blooms at the top of the stem. Its unique morphology allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Adenium obesum is also known for its toxic sap and has been used in traditional medicine and as a poison in some cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenium obesum has thick, swollen, and bulbous stems that are often covered in a rough, fissured bark that is typically reddish or brown in color.</p>
<p>Its leaves are usually alternate, elliptical or ovate in shape, and have a glossy green color, though they can be quite small in some varieties. The flowers are large and showy, with a yellow or orange corolla and a prominent red or pink staminode, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind or through animal contact.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to the arid environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium obesum is primarily native to Benin, Burkina, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Socotra, Somalia, Sudan-South Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, and Yemen.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these countries. The plant thrives in dry, hot climates and is often found near rivers or in rocky areas. It is known for its distinctive swollen base and is sometimes referred to as the "upas tree" or "desert apple.".</p>
<p>Adenium obesum has cultural and medicinal significance in many of the regions where it is native.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium obesum was mainly introduced to Society Is.</p>
<p>It has been distributed in various regions of the island, often found near coastal areas and dry riverbeds. The plant is cultivated for its ornamental value and traditional uses. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora.</p>
<p>It is now considered an invasive species in some parts of Society Is.</p>
