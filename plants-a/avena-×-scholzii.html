                    <h1>Avena × scholzii</h1>
<p>Avena × scholzii, commonly known as the intermediate oat, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Avena sativa (common oat) and Avena fatua (wild oat).</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Avena × scholzii is notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in disturbed environments.</p>
