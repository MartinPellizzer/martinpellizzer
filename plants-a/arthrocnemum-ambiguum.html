                    <h1>Arthrocnemum ambiguum</h1>
<p>Arthrocnemum ambiguum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Southwestern Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy stems that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and often reduced to scales, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Arthrocnemum ambiguum is well adapted to sandy soils and can survive extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
