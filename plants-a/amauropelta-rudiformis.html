                    <h1>Amauropelta rudiformis</h1>
<p>Amauropelta rudiformis, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in dense, rough-textured scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
