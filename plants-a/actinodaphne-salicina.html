                <h1>Actinodaphne salicina</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne salicina, commonly known as the Salina laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, woody drupe containing a single seed.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne salicina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne salicina has elliptical to ovate leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a light brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles, blooming from July to September, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, globose drupe that turns dark red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne salicina is primarily native to India.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the southern and eastern parts. This plant grows in moist, shaded forest areas and is commonly found in the Western Ghats and northeastern states. It is often associated with evergreen and semi-evergreen forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within India due to its preference for humid and tropical climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne salicina was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands for its ornamental value and potential use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland forest areas, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in natural habitats, sometimes competing with native species. Due to its adaptability, it has spread across several island nations in the region.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains a subject of ongoing study.</p>
