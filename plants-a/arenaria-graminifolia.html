                    <h1>Arenaria graminifolia</h1>
<p>Arenaria graminifolia, commonly known as the grassy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers in early summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions make it well-suited for rocky or arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Arenaria graminifolia is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments.</p>
