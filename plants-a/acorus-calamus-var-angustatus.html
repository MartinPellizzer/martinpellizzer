                <h1>Acorus calamus var. angustatus</h1>
<p>Acorus calamus var. angustatus, commonly known as narrow-leaved sweet flag, is a variant of the sweet flag plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense, cylindrical spike. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil and is often used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to Acorus calamus but differs in leaf morphology and habitat preference.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. angustatus has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged in a fan-like pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, pale yellowish-brown bark that has a somewhat fibrous texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months, and the flowers are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, berry-like structure that contains three seeds, which are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. angustatus is a variant of the sweet flag plant native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as India, China, and parts of Southeastern Asia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution extends to tropical and subtropical regions, where it is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with slow-moving or still freshwater habitats. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some areas, though its conservation status varies by region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. angustatus is a narrow-leaved variety of sweetflag that thrives in wet or moist environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through rhizome division or seed, with rhizome division being the most common and reliable method. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within one growing season, making it suitable for quick landscaping projects.</p>
<p>It prefers rich, loamy soil that remains consistently moist, with regular watering to maintain humidity. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning dead foliage in early spring helps maintain its appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with water-loving plants like iris or cattails can enhance its growth and create a natural wetland habitat.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. angustatus is a wetland plant that provides food and shelter for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as insects and birds, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a natural filter, improving water quality by absorbing excess nutrients. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along water edges.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves as a companion plant in wetland restoration projects, enhancing ecosystem resilience.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. angustatus is a wetland plant known for its historical and contemporary uses across various domains.</p>
<p>In culinary applications, its rhizomes have been used to flavor foods and beverages, particularly in traditional cuisines. Medicinally, it has been employed in herbal remedies for its purported digestive and antimicrobial properties. Industrially, the plant contributes to local economies through the harvesting and processing of its roots.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, often associated with purification and spiritual practices.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. angustatus has several popular cultivars that are favored for their ornamental value and adaptability, including 'Pineapple' and 'Variegatus'.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in hybridization efforts to create plants with enhanced foliage color and disease resistance. Hybrids involving Acorus calamus var. angustatus are prized for their ability to thrive in wet conditions and their ability to tolerate partial shade. Its horticultural importance lies in its use in water gardens and as a decorative element in shaded landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it remains a popular choice among gardeners and landscape designers.</p>
