                <h1>Aconitum vitosanum</h1>
<p>Aconitum vitosanum, commonly known as the European aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed leaflets that are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>Aconitum vitosanum is known for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that make it highly dangerous to humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum vitosanum has large, doubly compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its flowers are blue to purple, clustered in racemes, with showy petals and a spurred structure, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum vitosanum is primarily native to Bulgaria, Italy, and the NW.</p>
<p>Balkan Peninsula. This plant is commonly found in alpine and subalpine regions, often growing in moist, rocky soils. It thrives in mountainous areas with cool, temperate climates.</p>
<p>The species is known for its striking blue or purple flowers and is typically found in open meadows and forest edges.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum vitosanum was mainly introduced to regions with moist, temperate climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous areas and along stream banks, where it benefits from partial shade and consistent moisture. This plant has been introduced to parts of Europe and North America, often as an ornamental due to its striking blue or purple flowers. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species for resources.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its spread in non-native habitats.</p>
