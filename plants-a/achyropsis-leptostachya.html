                <h1>Achyropsis leptostachya</h1>
<p>Achyropsis leptostachya, commonly known as the slender-stemmed achyropsis, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically hairy foliage. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often branched and covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Achyropsis leptostachya is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots and a reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyropsis leptostachya has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and has a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green in color, with tubular structures and a blooming period during the summer months, primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyropsis leptostachya is primarily native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Namib Desert and the Succulent Karoo biome. This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing on cliff faces or among gravel. It is well adapted to extreme drought conditions and can survive with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the specific microhabitats that provide shelter and limited moisture.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyropsis leptostachya was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver foliage and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered invasive in several parts of southern Europe. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can colonize roadsides, pastures, and degraded habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it a competitive weed in natural ecosystems.</p>
<p>Management efforts focus on early detection and mechanical removal to prevent further spread.</p>
