                    <h1>Aspalathus capillaris</h1>
<p>Aspalathus capillaris, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape province of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.</p>
<p>Aspalathus capillaris is closely related to the more well-known rooibos plant, Aspalathus linearis, but differs in its leaf structure and habitat preferences.</p>
