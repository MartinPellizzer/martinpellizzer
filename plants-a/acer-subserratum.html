                <h1>Acer subserratum</h1>
<p>Acer subserratum, commonly known as the serrate maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and often have serrated edges. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras in the fall. It typically grows to a height of 10–15 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer subserratum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, typically 5–10 cm long, and change from dark green in summer to vibrant red or orange in autumn. The stem is smooth and slender, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a spreading habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are shallow and fibrous, helping it anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer subserratum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including Europe and North America, as an ornamental plant. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments within forested areas. This species typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, Acer subserratum is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer subserratum is a small to medium-sized ornamental tree known for its vibrant red leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with cuttings offering a faster and more reliable method. The growth cycle of Acer subserratum involves a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, requiring regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain its shape.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with companion plants like lavender or heather in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer subserratum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through improved soil conditions. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and reducing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer subserratum offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer subserratum is a species of maple tree known for its ornamental value and use in landscaping due to its vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its wood has been historically valued for crafting tools and decorative items. In traditional medicine, certain parts of the plant have been used to treat skin conditions and inflammation. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and change, often featured in local art and horticultural practices.</p>
<p>Its ecological role supports biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer subserratum has a variety of cultivars that are highly valued for their ornamental characteristics, including 'Aconitifolium' with its deep green foliage and 'Kirkstevensii' known for its striking red autumn color.</p>
<p>It also has several hybrids, such as 'Autumn Flame' and 'Crimson Queen', which combine the best traits of its parent species for enhanced garden performance. These cultivars and hybrids are particularly popular in horticulture due to their unique leaf colors and seasonal changes. They are often used in landscaping for their visual impact and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>Their horticultural importance lies in their ability to add seasonal interest and diversity to gardens and public spaces.</p>
