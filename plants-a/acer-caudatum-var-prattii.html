<p>Acer caudatum var. prattii, commonly known as the Pratts' maple, is a variant of the weeping maple native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, cascading branches that give it a unique, almost tree-like appearance. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. It produces small, red flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
