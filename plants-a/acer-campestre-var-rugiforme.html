                <h1>Acer campestre var. rugiforme</h1>
<p>Acer campestre var. rugiforme, commonly known as the rough-leaved maple, is a variant of the common maple species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and prefers well-drained soils. It produces small, red or orange samaras that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. rugiforme has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size of about 5-8 cm in length, and a dark green upper surface with a pale underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes during late spring, with a simple structure that relies on wind pollination. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. rugiforme is a rare variant of the field maple, native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Mountains and parts of the Balkans.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to scattered populations in isolated areas of Romania and Ukraine. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodlands. This species is typically found at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, Acer campestre var. rugiforme is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. rugiforme is a slow-growing, ornamental maple known for its unique, rugose bark and vibrant fall foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or softwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining cultivar traits. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soil, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead or diseased branches.</p>
<p>It is generally pest and disease resistant, though may occasionally attract aphids or scale, and is best planted with companion species like ornamental grasses or shrubs for a natural landscape effect.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. rugiforme is a small, slow-growing tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its flowers and offers berries that serve as a food source for birds. This plant acts as a companion plant in woodland ecosystems, helping to support biodiversity. Its dense root system also aids in erosion control by stabilizing soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by improving soil structure and supporting a variety of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. rugiforme is a lesser-known variant of the maple tree that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in traditional medicine, some local communities may employ its leaves or bark for minor herbal remedies. Industrially, it contributes to the timber and pulp industries, though its economic impact is modest compared to other maple species. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, representing resilience and adaptability due to its hardy nature.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems, such as providing habitat and supporting biodiversity, further underscores its importance in environmental conservation.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. rugiforme has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their unique foliage and ornamental value, such as 'Crimson Sentry' and 'Emerald Queen'.</p>
<p>These cultivars often exhibit enhanced coloration and compact growth habits, making them suitable for small gardens and urban landscapes. Hybrids involving this variety are less common but can be found in horticultural trials aimed at improving disease resistance and cold hardiness. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in challenging conditions while adding visual interest to the landscape.</p>
<p>Overall, it remains a valued addition to the collection of ornamental maples due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
