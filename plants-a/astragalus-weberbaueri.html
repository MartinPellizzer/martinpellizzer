                    <h1>Astragalus weberbaueri</h1>
<p>Astragalus weberbaueri, commonly known as Weberbauer's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Astragalus weberbaueri plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
