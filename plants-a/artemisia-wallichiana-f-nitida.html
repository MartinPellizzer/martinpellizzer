                    <h1>Artemisia wallichiana f. nitida</h1>
<p>Artemisia wallichiana f. nitida, commonly known as the silver artemisia, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine, soft hairs, which reflect light and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its aromatic leaves release a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed.</p>
