                <h1>Acronia millei</h1>
<p>Acronia millei, commonly known as the golden trumpet plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy appearance.</p>
<p>Acronia millei thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia millei has small, oval-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a bright green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia millei is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly in countries such as Costa Rica and Panama.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland forests and near riverbanks where the climate is warm and moist. This plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and partial to full sunlight. It is often seen growing along the edges of streams and in secondary growth habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia millei was mainly introduced to areas with suitable climatic conditions, particularly regions with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along urban edges. This plant has shown a preference for full sun exposure and is often seen thriving in areas with minimal competition. Its introduction has been linked to human activity, including landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become a common sight in many regions where it has been introduced.</p>
