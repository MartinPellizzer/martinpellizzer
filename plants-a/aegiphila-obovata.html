                <h1>Aegiphila obovata</h1>
<p>Aegiphila obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed aegiphila, is a shrub native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Aegiphila obovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila obovata has leaves that are obovate in shape, with a smooth surface, arranged oppositely along the stem, and typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, displaying a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale gray bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a tubular shape and pale yellow to orange color, blooming during the dry season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils in which the plant typically grows.</p>
