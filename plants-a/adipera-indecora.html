                <h1>Adipera indecora</h1>
<p>Adipera indecora, commonly known as the stinking beauty, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange ray flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypselae, which are dispersed by wind. Adipera indecora thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adipera indecora has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, slightly woody texture and a light green to brownish color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipera indecora is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically from New York to Florida.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This plant thrives in areas with rich, organic soil and is often associated with riparian zones. It is particularly common in the southeastern United States, including states like Georgia and Alabama.</p>
<p>Adipera indecora is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and water filtration.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipera indecora was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread beyond cultivated areas into native ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly invasive in moist, disturbed habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological effects.</p>
