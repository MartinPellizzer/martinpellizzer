                        <h1>Abies forrestii var. smithii</h1>
<p>Abies forrestii var. smithii, commonly known as the Smith's fir, is a rare and highly sought-after variant of the Himalayan fir.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in regions of Nepal and Bhutan, where it thrives in cool, moist, and high-altitude environments. This variant is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly twisted. Its cones are typically reddish-brown and release seeds in the fall, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
