                    <h1>Asclepias suberosa</h1>
<p>Asclepias suberosa, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for both larvae and adult insects.</p>
<p>Its milky sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but essential for its defense against herbivores.</p>
