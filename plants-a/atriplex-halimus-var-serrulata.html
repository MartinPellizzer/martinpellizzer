                    <h1>Atriplex halimus var. serrulata</h1>
<p>Atriplex halimus var. serrulata, commonly known as the serrated saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and drought conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
