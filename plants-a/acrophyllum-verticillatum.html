                <h1>Acrophyllum verticillatum</h1>
<p>Acrophyllum verticillatum, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is often found in forested areas. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>Acrophyllum verticillatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophyllum verticillatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged in whorls of three to five along the stems, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green to brownish color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophyllum verticillatum is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the fynbos biome, which is known for its unique and diverse plant life. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in areas with a Mediterranean climate. It is well adapted to the harsh coastal conditions, including strong winds and salt spray.</p>
<p>Acrophyllum verticillatum plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophyllum verticillatum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the European colonization efforts. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is commonly found in dunes and sandy soils. It has since become naturalized and is now considered an invasive species in some parts of the country.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed habitats have raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
