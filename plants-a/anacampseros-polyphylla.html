<p>Anacampseros polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leafed ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This species is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
