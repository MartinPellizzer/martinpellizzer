<p>Adenia schweinfurthii, commonly known as the African star gooseberry, is a shrub native to eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and distinctive, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Adenia schweinfurthii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia schweinfurthii has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, aiding in water storage and nutrient absorption in its arid habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia schweinfurthii is a rare and endangered plant native to the eastern arc of the Congo Basin, primarily found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>Although its native range is limited, it has been recorded in parts of Tanzania and Uganda as well. It thrives in humid, lowland rainforests with high levels of rainfall and moderate temperatures. The plant typically grows at altitudes between 300 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is currently listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenia schweinfurthii is a striking tropical plant known for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for faster growth. This plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid climates and requiring a long growing season.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant and encourage new growth are recommended. While generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
