                <h1>Adenia schweinfurthii</h1>
<p>Adenia schweinfurthii, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and striking, night-blooming white flowers that emit a strong fragrance. The plant produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique floral display and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia schweinfurthii has compound, pinnate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with elliptical to ovate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brownish-gray in color, and it grows as an upright shrub or small tree. The flowers are large, showy, and clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and a distinctive, fleshy, spurred structure, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects, primarily bees. The fruit is a fleshy, berry-like capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by animals feeding on the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia schweinfurthii is primarily native to Cameroon, Central African Republic, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan-South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>This plant is found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. Adenia schweinfurthii is known for its distinctive appearance and is often found in lowland and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of Central and Eastern Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia schweinfurthii was mainly introduced to gardens and botanical collections in tropical and subtropical regions due to its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in horticultural settings in countries like Australia, the United States, and parts of Europe. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its introduction has led to its cultivation in both private and public green spaces.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is grown.</p>
