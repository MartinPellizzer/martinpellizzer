                <h1>Achnatherum lettermanii</h1>
<p>Achnatherum lettermanii, commonly known as Letterman's needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant produces slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it blooms with small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Achnatherum lettermanii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum lettermanii has narrow, linear leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a grass-like appearance, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light green to grayish-brown color, growing upright and often forming dense clumps. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences composed of small, greenish to pale blue florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry achene that is dispersed by wind, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum lettermanii is primarily native to the western United States, including states such as Nevada, Utah, and California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats like grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and rocky soils. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. It is particularly associated with disturbed sites and can be found in areas with low precipitation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum lettermanii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states like Nevada, Utah, and California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along trails. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats with well-drained soils. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered environments.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed in agricultural and ecological settings due to its rapid growth and spreading habit.</p>
