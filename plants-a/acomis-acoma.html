                <h1>Acomis acoma</h1>
<p>Acomis acoma, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, and its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc. Acomis acoma typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges.</p>
<p>It is often mistaken for true dandelions due to its similar appearance but lacks the characteristic milky sap found in those species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acomis acoma has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and typically range from 10 to 20 cm in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and smooth, with a light green color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomis acoma is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open grasslands and disturbed areas within these regions. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is an important component of the local flora in these areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the eastern part of Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomis acoma was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and gardening.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and areas with disturbed vegetation. This plant has spread beyond its native range due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions. It is often seen in urban and suburban environments where it thrives in sunny, well-drained areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities in certain regions.</p>
