<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The plant features silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and it typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. Acomis acoma is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a suitable plant for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acomis acoma has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and typically range from 10 to 20 cm in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with smooth, pale green bark that grows in a compact, low form. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomis acoma is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States, specifically found in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in wetland areas. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is commonly found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Acomis acoma typically grows at low to mid-altitude regions, usually below 50 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered endangered, and conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acomis acoma is a delicate flowering plant known for its striking blue-violet blooms.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. The growth cycle of Acomis acoma typically spans from spring to early summer, with flowering occurring in late spring.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like thyme or lavender can help repel pests and improve garden aesthetics.</p>
