                    <h1>Angraecum palmicola</h1>
<p>Angraecum palmicola, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that open at night. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance to attract moths, which are its primary pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
