                    <h1>Astragalus suberosus subsp. haarbachii</h1>
<p>Astragalus suberosus subsp.</p>
<p>haarbachii, commonly known as the Harbach's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves that are typically trifoliate or pinnately compound.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow to greenish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf and flower structure.</p>
