The plant has slender, hairy stems and small, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Antennaria acuta plays a role in stabilizing soil in these extreme environments and is an important part of the local flora.</p>
