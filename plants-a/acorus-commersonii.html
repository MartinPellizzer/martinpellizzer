                <h1>Acorus commersonii</h1>
<p>Acorus commersonii, commonly known as narrow-leaf sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are typically sword-shaped and can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Acorus commersonii is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus commersonii has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem with a smooth, dark brown bark that grows horizontally underground. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically greenish-yellow in color, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, three-chambered capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>Its roots are rhizomes that spread horizontally, allowing the plant to form dense colonies in wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus commersonii is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland environments, such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Acorus commersonii is known for its aromatic rhizomes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus commersonii was mainly introduced to wetlands, marshes, and slow-moving water bodies.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich aquatic environments. This plant is often found along the edges of ponds, lakes, and rivers. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread rapidly in these habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
