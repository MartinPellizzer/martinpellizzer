                <h1>Achillea duffourii</h1>
<p>Achillea duffourii, commonly known as Dufour's yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is known for its delicate, fern-like foliage. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Dufour's yarrow is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea duffourii has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with fine hairs, rising from the base and branching sparingly. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in flat-topped umbels, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, allowing for wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea duffourii is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Austria, Italy, Slovenia, and Romania, where it thrives in rocky and gravelly soils. This species prefers sunny, open environments such as meadows, slopes, and rocky outcrops. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea duffourii is considered a vulnerable species in some regions and is protected in several European countries.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea duffourii is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant yellow flowers and drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too wet.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea duffourii is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its ability to attract beneficial insects. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its deep root system, which stabilizes soil in rocky or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea duffourii contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving habitat quality in its native environments.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea duffourii is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value, often used in gardens and landscaping due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, it may be occasionally used in herbal teas or infusions in certain traditional practices. In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, though scientific validation is limited. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators, which has ecological economic value.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local traditions, though specific symbolic meanings are not widely documented.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea duffourii has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Lilacina' and 'Purpurea,' which are known for their striking pink and purple flower colors.</p>
<p>It is also involved in the creation of hybrids with other members of the Achillea genus, contributing to the diversity of garden-worthy plants. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced hardiness and extended blooming periods, making them more adaptable to various garden conditions. Due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance, Achillea duffourii holds significant horticultural importance in perennial gardens.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids are valued for their ability to add color and texture to landscapes across different climates.</p>
