                    <h1>Aragallus bryophilus</h1>
<p>Aragallus bryophilus, commonly known as the moss-eating orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant that thrives on the surface of mosses rather than in soil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its small, delicate appearance with intricate floral structures. This plant is typically found in humid, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests. Its specialized roots allow it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the moss substrate.</p>
<p>The botanical significance of Aragallus bryophilus lies in its ecological niche and its role in the complex interdependencies of forest ecosystems.</p>
