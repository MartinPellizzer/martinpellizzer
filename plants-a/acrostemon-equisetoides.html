                <h1>Acrostemon equisetoides</h1>
<p>Acrostemon equisetoides, commonly known as the spike rush lily, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zingiberaceae, which includes gingers, and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in a dense cluster. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water garden landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostemon equisetoides has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and range in length from 10 to 30 centimeters with a pale green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, dark brown bark that exhibits a creeping growth pattern, often forming dense mats. Its flowers are small, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostemon equisetoides is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and abundant rainfall. It is often associated with muddy or saturated soils in lowland regions.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes mangrove swamps and other moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostemon equisetoides was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaping projects in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in humid climates and can spread through its rhizomes, making it a potential invasive species in some areas. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and native plant species.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its uncontrolled spread in non-native habitats.</p>
