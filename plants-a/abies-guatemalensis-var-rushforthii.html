<p>Abies guatemalensis var. rushforthii, commonly known as the Rushforth's fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the highlands of Guatemala.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The tree produces distinctive cone clusters, which are typically pendulous and contain small, winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variant is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
