                <h1>Aconitum fletcherianum</h1>
<p>Aconitum fletcherianum, commonly known as Fletcher's aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed divisions that are often hairy.</p>
<p>Aconitum fletcherianum is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and cooler climates, making it a hardy plant in alpine environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum fletcherianum has leaves that are deeply lobed, with a palmate or trifoliate shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 10 to 20 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a dark green to reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with a spurred petal and multiple stamens, blooming from July to September and pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum fletcherianum is primarily native to the East Himalaya, Tibet.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of this area, where it thrives in cool and moist environments. This plant is typically associated with high-altitude habitats, often growing in rocky soils or forested areas. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>
<p>Aconitum fletcherianum is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum fletcherianum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various regions. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and spreads rapidly through its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread.</p>
