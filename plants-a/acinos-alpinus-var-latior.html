                <h1>Acinos alpinus var. latior</h1>
<p>Acinos alpinus var. latior, commonly known as the broadleaf alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos alpinus var. latior has narrow, linear to oblanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense heads, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind due to its light weight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the rocky, alpine environment where the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos alpinus var. latior is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees, Alps, and Carpathians.</p>
<p>Its current distribution extends to parts of northern Africa and western Asia, though it remains primarily confined to high-altitude environments. This species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is commonly found in alpine meadows and mountain grasslands. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat fragmentation and climate change, Acinos alpinus var. latior is considered vulnerable, with limited populations and restricted range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acinos alpinus var. latior is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to alpine regions, known for its dense foliage and vibrant flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the existing clumps, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late summer, followed by a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is mainly done to remove dead foliage. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with alpine flowers or grasses can enhance its ornamental value and promote a balanced ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acinos alpinus var. latior is a hardy alpine plant that provides food and shelter for various small mammals and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. It acts as a companion plant in alpine meadows, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by supporting microbial activity in the soil.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acinos alpinus var. latior is a hardy alpine plant known for its small, edible flowers and leaves, which can be used in culinary applications such as teas, salads, and garnishes.</p>
<p>It has traditional medicinal uses, particularly in herbal remedies for respiratory and digestive ailments. While not widely used in industrial applications, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports pollinators in its native alpine habitats. Culturally, it is valued in certain regions for its resilience and beauty, symbolizing endurance in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems makes it important for conservation efforts in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acinos alpinus var. latior has a limited number of cultivated forms, though it is occasionally used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Alpinum' and 'Purpureum', which are prized for their striking foliage and compact growth habit. While few hybrids have been developed specifically for this variety, it is sometimes crossed with other Acinos species to create more vigorous garden plants. Its horticultural importance lies mainly in rock gardens and alpine settings where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific growing requirements, it is not widely cultivated but remains a sought-after plant among specialty gardeners.</p>
