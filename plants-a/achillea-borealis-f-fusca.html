                <h1>Achillea borealis f. fusca</h1>
<p>Achillea borealis f. fusca, commonly known as the gray mountain yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features gray-green, hairy leaves and flat, white to pale yellow flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea borealis f. fusca has narrow, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are basal and arranged in a rosette, with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is compact and low-growing. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's alpine and arctic habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea borealis f. fusca is a rare plant species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific areas in Scandinavia, particularly in Norway and Sweden. It thrives in open, rocky or sandy habitats, often found in alpine and subalpine zones. This plant typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is listed as endangered in several countries, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea borealis f. fusca is a low-growing perennial plant known for its attractive silver-gray foliage and fluffy white flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the roots in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in cooler climates and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in spring, and pruning is best done after flowering to maintain its compact shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too damp.</p>
<p>Companion planting with sedums or lavender can enhance its appearance and improve garden biodiversity.</p>
