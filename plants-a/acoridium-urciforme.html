                    <h1>Acoridium urciforme</h1>
<p>Acoridium urciforme, commonly known as the broad-leaved water plantain, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features elongated, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Acoridium urciforme is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
