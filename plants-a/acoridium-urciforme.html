                <h1>Acoridium urciforme</h1>
<p>Acoridium urciforme, commonly known as the broad-leaved water plantain, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features elongated, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Acoridium urciforme is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium urciforme has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and are typically 10-15 cm long with a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a creeping growth pattern. Its flowers are small, greenish-white in color, and have a simple structure with three petals and three sepals, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium urciforme is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas. This plant thrives in humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and is sometimes seen near water sources.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium urciforme was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as accidental transport via contaminated soil or equipment.</p>
<p>It has established itself in disturbed areas, including roadsides and abandoned fields, where it thrives in dry, sunny conditions. The plant's ability to spread rapidly makes it a potential invasive species in regions where it is not native. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its competitive nature and impact on native flora.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
