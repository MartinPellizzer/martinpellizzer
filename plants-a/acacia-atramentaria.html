                        <h1>Acacia atramentaria</h1>
<p>Acacia atramentaria, commonly known as the black wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments.</p>
<p>Acacia atramentaria is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia atramentaria is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops, sandy soils, and along riverbanks in these areas. This plant thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various local wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in reclamation projects in degraded landscapes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia atramentaria was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant spreads rapidly through seed dispersal and can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is largely attributed to human activities, including horticulture and land clearing.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it poses a significant threat to local ecosystems.</p>
