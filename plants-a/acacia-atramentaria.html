<p>Acacia atramentaria, commonly known as the black wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments.</p>
<p>Acacia atramentaria is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
