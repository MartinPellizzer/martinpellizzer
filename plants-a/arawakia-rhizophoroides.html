<p>Arawakia rhizophoroides, commonly known as the Arawak mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, woody structure and its ability to thrive in brackish or saline water environments. The plant has prop roots that grow downward from its trunk, providing stability in soft, waterlogged soils. Its leaves are typically small, ovate, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Arawakia rhizophoroides plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial life.</p>
