                        <h1>Acacia squarrosa</h1>
<p>Acacia squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrose acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, disc-like phyllodes that are often covered in a powdery coating, giving it a grayish appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Acacia squarrosa is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia squarrosa is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Western Australia, Northern Territory, and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This plant thrives in coastal and inland areas with low rainfall. It is often seen growing in open woodlands and shrublands.</p>
<p>Acacia squarrosa is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia squarrosa was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond its original cultivation areas and is now considered an invasive species in several parts of the country. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is highly adaptable to different environmental conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to its classification as a weed in some regions.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and mitigate its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
