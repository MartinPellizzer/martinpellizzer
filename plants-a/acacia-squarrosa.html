<p>Acacia squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrose acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, disc-like phyllodes that are often covered in a powdery coating, giving it a grayish appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Acacia squarrosa is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
