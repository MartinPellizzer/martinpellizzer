<p>Armeriastrum avenaceum, commonly known as plains mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a suitable choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
