                <h1>Adiantum rhizophytum</h1>
<p>Adiantum rhizophytum, commonly known as the creeping sword fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Malaysia. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a finely divided structure that gives it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum rhizophytum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum rhizophytum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 10â€“20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered in a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a vertical pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically greenish in color and appear on the underside of the leaves during late spring. The plant does not produce true flowers or fruits, instead relying on spores for reproduction, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum rhizophytum is primarily native to Brazil Southeast and Brazil West-Central.</p>
<p>This fern species is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in humid environments, often growing in shaded forest understories. The plant is well adapted to the moist, nutrient-rich soils of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific regions within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum rhizophytum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it a common sight in temperate and subtropical climates. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental species due to its delicate, fern-like foliage. It has been introduced to several regions beyond its native habitat, including parts of North America and Europe.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
