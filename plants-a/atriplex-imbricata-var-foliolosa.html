                    <h1>Atriplex imbricata var. foliolosa</h1>
<p>Atriplex imbricata var. foliolosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone soils. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, enhancing its survival in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
