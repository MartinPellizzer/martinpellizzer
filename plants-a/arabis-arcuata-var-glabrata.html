<p>Arabis arcuata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in North America.</p>

The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in racemes along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking native, drought-tolerant plants.</p>
