                <h1>Acradenia euodiiformis</h1>
<p>Acradenia euodiiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acradenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acradenia euodiiformis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that exudes a mild aromatic scent when broken. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the wet season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acradenia euodiiformis is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the eastern regions of Australia, specifically within these two states. It typically grows in subtropical and tropical rainforest areas. The species is adapted to the humid and warm climate of these regions.</p>
<p>It is often found in coastal and inland rainforests, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acradenia euodiiformis was mainly introduced to the eastern regions of Australia, particularly in the states of Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in subtropical and tropical rainforests, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This species is often associated with rocky outcrops and gullies, preferring areas with high humidity and partial shade. Its introduction has been linked to both natural dispersal and human activities such as land clearing and horticultural planting.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
