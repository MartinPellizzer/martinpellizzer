                <h1>Adelobotrys hoyosii</h1>
<p>Adelobotrys hoyosii, commonly known as the Hoyos's adelobotrys, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually clustered in umbels and are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys hoyosii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exhibits a slight fissuring pattern. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters, blooming during the spring season, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in the plant's ability to thrive in rocky or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys hoyosii is primarily native to the highlands of central and eastern Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is found in the Andean regions, particularly in the states of Portuguesa, Miranda, and Aragua. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments within humid montane forests. It is also present in parts of western Guyana and northeastern Colombia.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys hoyosii was mainly introduced to areas with specific ecological conditions that support its growth, such as well-drained soils and moderate climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a temperate to subtropical climate, where it thrives in open or partially shaded environments. The plant is often associated with disturbed habitats, including roadsides and abandoned fields, due to its ability to colonize such areas quickly. Its introduction has been documented in several countries, particularly in the Americas, where it has become naturalized in some regions.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to other invasive species, and it is not widely spread across different ecosystems.</p>
