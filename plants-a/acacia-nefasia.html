                    <h1>Acacia nefasia</h1>
<p>Acacia nefasia, commonly known as the desert wattle, is a shrub native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and compound leaves that are reduced to small, needle-like phyllodes. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Acacia nefasia is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems and a high tolerance for drought.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for native wildlife in its native range.</p>
