                <h1>Aeginetia selebica</h1>
<p>Aeginetia selebica, commonly known as the Celebes sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeginetia selebica has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, growing in a creeping or ascending pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from October to December, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>
