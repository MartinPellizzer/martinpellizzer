                    <h1>Alkanna noneiformis</h1>
<p>Alkanna noneiformis, commonly known as the desert inkplant, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its glandular hairs and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant produces a unique, dark red to black resinous substance from its roots, which has been historically used for ink and dye. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine, stinging hairs, contributing to its defensive adaptations in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Alkanna noneiformis thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping in desert landscapes.</p>
