                    <h1>Arenaria viscida</h1>
<p>Arenaria viscida, commonly known as sticky sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, often sticky leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Arenaria viscida plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
