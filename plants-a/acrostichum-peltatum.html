                <h1>Acrostichum peltatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum peltatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, pinnately compound leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, broad, and often slightly curled appearance. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it a striking addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum peltatum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are broadly ovate to triangular in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 1 meter in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a leathery texture. The stem is erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, blooming in the summer months and pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dark brown, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical dispersal as it dries and splits open.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum peltatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, moist soil, often found in swamps, riverbanks, and coastal regions. This plant is commonly associated with mangrove ecosystems and can be found in brackish or freshwater environments. It is also present in some Caribbean islands and along the Atlantic coast of the United States.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, but its natural range remains largely within the Americas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum peltatum was mainly introduced to wetland and riparian areas where it can thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as ditches, stream banks, and flooded fields. This plant is often invasive in these environments, outcompeting native vegetation for resources. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a challenging species to control.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become established in various regions beyond its native range.</p>
