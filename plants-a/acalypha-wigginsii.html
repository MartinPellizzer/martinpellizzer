                        <h1>Acalypha wigginsii</h1>
<p>Acalypha wigginsii, commonly known as the Wiggins' hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Moorea in French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of a central yellow disk surrounded by bright red or orange bracts. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is known for its hairy stems and leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha wigginsii belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and horsetails. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many species with diverse morphological features. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse structures and some containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupplant," characterized by their colorful bracts and unique floral structures.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha wigginsii, a specific type within the genus Acalypha, known for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha wigginsii is primarily native to the Galápagos Islands.</p>
<p>This species is found in the unique ecosystems of the Galápagos, which are known for their high level of endemism. It thrives in the volcanic soils and coastal habitats of the archipelago. The plant is an important part of the local flora and is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of the region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Galápagos, making it a key species for the area's biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha wigginsii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and can tolerate a range of soil types. This plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along creek banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its success in these habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
