                <h1>Aciotis aristata</h1>
<p>Aciotis aristata, commonly known as the arrowhead daisy, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Aciotis aristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis aristata has leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are yellow, with tubular corollas and five lobes, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis aristata is primarily native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is found in states such as Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. This plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, including desert grasslands and rocky soils. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Aciotis aristata is often associated with disturbed soils and can thrive in open, sunny habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis aristata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban settings. The plant spreads primarily through seeds dispersed by wind, water, or human activity. Its rapid growth and adaptability allow it to outcompete native vegetation in invaded areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
