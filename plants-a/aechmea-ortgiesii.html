                <h1>Aechmea ortgiesii</h1>
<p>Aechmea ortgiesii, commonly known as the silver pine bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spire-like rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aechmea ortgiesii is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea ortgiesii has rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow, pointed, and arranged in a spiral pattern around the central stem, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, thick stem covered in a fibrous, grayish bark that grows upward from the base. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, spiky flower stem with showy, violet to purple bracts, and it blooms during the summer months, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a three-lobed berry that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the surrounding environment.</p>
