<p>Argophyllum lejourdanii var. cryptophleba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf argophyllum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in semi-arid to arid environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for protective measures.</p>
