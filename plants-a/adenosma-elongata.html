                <h1>Adenosma elongata</h1>
<p>Adenosma elongata, commonly known as the slender adenosma, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and India.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and a prominent yellow corona.</p>
<p>Adenosma elongata is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma elongata has slender, upright stems that are smooth and green, with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Its leaves are alternate, ovate in shape, and have a bright green color, measuring approximately 2â€“4 cm in length. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma elongata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas. This species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in secondary forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the region due to specific ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma elongata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread throughout the country. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. It is considered an environmental weed due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
<p>Its introduction has had significant impacts on native ecosystems.</p>
