                            <h1>Acinos × Jahnianus</h1>
<p>Jahn's acino, scientifically known as Acinos × jahnianus, is a rare and hybrid plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, delicate white flowers. This plant thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in sparse vegetation where it competes for limited resources. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Jahn's acino is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and human encroachment. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique botanical marvel for future generations.</p>
