                    <h1>Atriplex conduplicata</h1>
<p>Atriplex conduplicata, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small green or yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity.</p>
<p>Atriplex conduplicata plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
