<p>Astrocoma, commonly known as the starcup or starcup cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in countries like Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its compact, spiny stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. Astrocoma species are typically drought-tolerant, making them well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>They are valued not only for their ornamental appeal but also for their ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
