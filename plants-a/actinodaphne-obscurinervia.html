                <h1>Actinodaphne obscurinervia</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne obscurinervia, commonly known as the dark-veined actinodaphne, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical lowland forests, thriving in shaded environments. Its leaves are dark green with prominent, dark veins, and it produces small, fragrant flowers followed by drupes.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne obscurinervia has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, and they vary in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a pale gray bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dark blue drupe containing a single seed, which is dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne obscurinervia is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>This species is found in the mountainous regions of this area, where it thrives in humid and subtropical climates. It is commonly distributed in provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan. The plant prefers well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to this specific region in southern and central China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne obscurinervia was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where its ornamental value and adaptability to humid climates make it desirable.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with rich soil and high rainfall, such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. The plant's ability to thrive in shaded to partially sunny conditions has contributed to its spread in both natural and cultivated environments. Its introduction has sometimes led to its establishment in native ecosystems, raising concerns about its potential impact on local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, careful monitoring is recommended to prevent unintended ecological consequences.</p>
