                <h1>Acianthera alpina</h1>
<p>Acianthera alpina, commonly known as the Alpine acianthera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a unique structure that resembles orchids. Acianthera alpina thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera alpina has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green, glossy upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a light green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and white to pale pink in color, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, black seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or alpine soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera alpina is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, including countries such as Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and mountainous areas, typically at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters. This orchid prefers cool, moist environments and is often associated with rocky or alpine habitats. It is a rare and specialized species, with a limited geographic range.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera alpina was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest environments. This plant was introduced primarily as an ornamental due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. It has since spread into natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
