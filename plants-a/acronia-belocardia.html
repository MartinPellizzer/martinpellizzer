                <h1>Acronia belocardia</h1>
<p>Acronia belocardia, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Acronia belocardia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia belocardia has simple, alternate leaves that are oval in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-7 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, exhibiting a spiral growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and aiding in the plant's survival in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia belocardia is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest floors where it thrives in the humid and cool conditions. This plant is most prevalent in states such as Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia. It is often associated with rich, organic soil and can be found in mixed hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia belocardia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the late 1990s in Oregon and Washington. The plant was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport via soil or plant material. It has since spread to several wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still under study.</p>
