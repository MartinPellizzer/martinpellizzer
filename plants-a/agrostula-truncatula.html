                    <h1>Agrostula truncatula</h1>
<p>Agrostula truncatula, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandgrass, is a species of grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Agrostula truncatula plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert animals.</p>
