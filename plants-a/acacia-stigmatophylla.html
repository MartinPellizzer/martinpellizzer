                    <h1>Acacia stigmatophylla</h1>
<p>Acacia stigmatophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are typically narrow and leathery. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Acacia stigmatophylla is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
