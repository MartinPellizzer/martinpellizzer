                <h1>Acrotome belckii</h1>
<p>Acrotome belckii, commonly known as the African firecracker, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking red and orange tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and color.</p>
<p>Acrotome belckii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotome belckii has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green with five petals, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotome belckii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This plant thrives in humid, lowland forests and is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth areas. It is commonly seen in the understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotome belckii was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been observed thriving in disturbed soils and urban environments, making it a common sight in gardens and parks. The plant's adaptability to various soil types and climate conditions has contributed to its spread. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
