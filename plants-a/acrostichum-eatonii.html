                <h1>Acrostichum eatonii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum eatonii, commonly known as the Eaton's fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically near streams or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum eatonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum eatonii has large, pinnately compound leaves that are bright green, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is sturdy and somewhat fibrous, with a light grayish bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in late summer, and are pollinated by wind. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in wet, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum eatonii is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and mangrove ecosystems where it thrives in brackish water conditions. This plant is also present in some regions of southern Florida, USA, and along the Atlantic coast of Central America. It prefers humid, tropical climates with high levels of sunlight and moderate salinity.</p>
<p>Acrostichum eatonii plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum eatonii was mainly introduced to wetlands and riparian areas along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in brackish or saltwater marshes, where it thrives in the presence of tidal influence. The plant has been documented in several states including Florida, Texas, and Louisiana. Its introduction has been associated with both natural and human-assisted dispersal along coastal zones.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most of its range.</p>
