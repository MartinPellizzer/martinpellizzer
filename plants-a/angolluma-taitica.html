<p>Angolluma taitica, commonly known as the Taiti orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Angolluma taitica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
