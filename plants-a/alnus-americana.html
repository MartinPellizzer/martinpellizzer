                    <h1>Alnus americana</h1>
<p>Alnus americana, commonly known as the American hazelnut or black alder, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and catkins that produce its wind-pollinated flowers. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are a food source for various wildlife species. Alnus americana thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria.</p>
