                    <h1>Avicennia spicata</h1>
<p>Avicennia spicata, commonly known as the slender mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in intertidal zones, where it tolerates periodic submersion and high salt concentrations. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss and salt accumulation. Its roots form a complex network that stabilizes coastal sediments and prevents erosion.</p>
<p>Avicennia spicata plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
