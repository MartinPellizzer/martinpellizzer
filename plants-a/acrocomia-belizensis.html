                <h1>Acrocomia belizensis</h1>
<p>Acrocomia belizensis, commonly known as the Belize palm, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Belize.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clustered, edible fruits. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocomia belizensis has palm-like leaves that are long, narrow, and pinnately arranged, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and unbranched, with a smooth, grayish bark that grows upward in a single direction. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellowish-green petals and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed drupe that disperses its seeds by gravity and animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the moist, tropical soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia belizensis is primarily native to southern Belize and northern Guatemala.</p>
<p>It is found in the lowland tropical regions of these areas, particularly in the vicinity of the Maya Mountains. This plant thrives in dry to semi-humid climates and is commonly found in open wooded areas and along riverbanks. It is a member of the Arecaceae family, known for its palm-like appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Central America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia belizensis was mainly introduced to the Neotropics, particularly in Central and South America, as a potential ornamental and economic plant.</p>
<p>It was introduced for its unique palm-like appearance and potential use in agroforestry systems. The distribution includes countries such as Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras, where it has been cultivated in both natural and managed environments. Despite its introduction, it remains relatively rare in the wild and is primarily found in cultivation.</p>
<p>Its spread is limited due to specific environmental requirements and human intervention.</p>
