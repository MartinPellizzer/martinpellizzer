<p>Acalypha clutioides, commonly known as the false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, showy flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow, red, or orange, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Acalypha clutioides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha clutioides has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 3 to 8 cm in length, with a glossy dark green color and prominent veins.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, with greenish-white petals and stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha clutioides is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of the Caribbean and southern Florida, where it has been introduced as an ornamental plant. This species thrives in moist, shady environments, often growing in the understorey of forests or along stream banks. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from sea level to about 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat is threatened by deforestation and habitat loss, leading to concerns about its long-term conservation status.</p>
