<p>Alsine villarii var. semipubens, commonly known as the pubescent alsine, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically features prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The leaves are linear to ovate, often with a bluish-green hue and are also densely pubescent. Small, inconspicuous flowers are borne in clusters, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss.</p>
