                    <h1>Arrhostoxylum repens</h1>
<p>Arrhostoxylum repens, commonly known as creeping cholla, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that often root at the nodes, forming extensive mats along the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation to minimize water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Arrhostoxylum repens is well adapted to harsh, desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
