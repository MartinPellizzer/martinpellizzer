<p>Arctium triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in clusters, which are followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Arctium triflorum thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
