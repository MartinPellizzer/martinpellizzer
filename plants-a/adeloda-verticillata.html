                <h1>Adeloda verticillata</h1>
<p>Adeloda verticillata, commonly known as the mountain mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Adeloda verticillata is adapted to withstand drought and temperature extremes, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adeloda verticillata has leaves that are opposite in arrangement, ovate in shape, with a smooth texture, and range from 2 to 5 cm in length, typically displaying a bright green color.</p>
<p>Its stems are cylindrical, slightly woody, and have a greyish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, usually in shades of pink or white, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adeloda verticillata is primarily native to Arkansas and Texas.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in these two states. It thrives in sandy or clay soils and is often associated with open woodlands and grasslands. Adeloda verticillata is well adapted to the climate and environmental conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adeloda verticillata was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along irrigation channels. The plant forms dense mats that help reduce soil erosion and provide habitat for small animals. However, its rapid growth can lead to the displacement of native vegetation.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes local flora.</p>
