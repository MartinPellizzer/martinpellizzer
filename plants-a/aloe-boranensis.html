<p>Aloe boranensis, commonly known as the Boran aloe, is a succulent plant native to Kenya.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is used in traditional medicine and skincare products.</p>
<p>Aloe boranensis is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water to survive.</p>
