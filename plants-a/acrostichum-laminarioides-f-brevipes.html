<p>Acrostichum laminarioides f. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed sea hibiscus, is a variant of the sea hibiscus native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its compact growth habit and robust, waxy leaves that are typically shorter than the standard form. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive red throat, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in saline or brackish environments, often found in coastal dunes or mangrove swamps.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to high-salinity conditions makes it an important species for ecological studies in coastal ecosystems.</p>
