                    <h1>Atriplex gardneri var. robusta</h1>
<p>Atriplex gardneri var. robusta, commonly known as the robust saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by a variety of pollinators. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and thrive in poor, saline conditions.</p>
