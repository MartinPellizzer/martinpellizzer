                        <h1>Abrus aureus subsp. littoralis</h1>
<p>Abrus aureus subsp.</p>
<p>littoralis, commonly known as the coastal velvet tamarind, is a perennial shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers and bean-like, toxic seeds enclosed in red pods.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces a strong, unpleasant odor, which may deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abrus aureus subsp.</p>
<p>littoralis belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes horsetails and their relatives, known for their primitive features.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a diverse group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by their complex floral structures. Its order is Fabales, which includes legumes and other plants that often form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Abrus, a group of flowering plants that includes species known for their ornamental value and some toxic properties.</p>
<p>Its species is Abrus aureus, a plant known for its bright orange seeds and is a member of the Fabaceae family, with the subspecies littoralis adapted to coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus aureus subsp.</p>
<p>littoralis is primarily native to Madagascar. This subspecies is commonly found along coastal areas and sandy soils in the eastern and southern regions of the island.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed or open habitats. The plant is known for its distinctive red seeds enclosed in a showy, bean-like pod.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the native range of Madagascar, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus aureus subsp.</p>
<p>littoralis was mainly introduced to coastal and estuarine environments along the eastern and southern coasts of Australia. It thrives in saline and brackish soils, often colonizing areas with high water tables and tidal influence.</p>
<p>This subspecies is commonly found in mangrove swamps, salt marshes, and estuarine margins, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities such as land modification and coastal development.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems remains largely understudied.</p>
