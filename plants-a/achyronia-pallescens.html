                <h1>Achyronia pallescens</h1>
<p>Achyronia pallescens, commonly known as the pale achyronia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, pale green stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically small and yellowish, appearing in clusters.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia pallescens has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter, often grayish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white to pale pink, and clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia pallescens is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing in sandy or gravelly soils. This plant thrives in open habitats such as plains, grasslands, and disturbed areas. It is often seen along roadsides and in desert environments where water is scarce.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones that provide the right balance of sunlight and drainage.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia pallescens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and abandoned lots.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and well-drained soil. This plant is often found in regions where human activity has altered the natural landscape. Its introduction has led to its spread in several parts of North America.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species that may compete with native flora in certain environments.</p>
