<p>Allocephalus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often spiny leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers. Allocephalus species are typically found in coastal areas and saline environments, adapting to harsh, salty conditions. They have a rosette growth form, which helps them conserve moisture and withstand strong winds.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Allocephalus comosus, which is native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
