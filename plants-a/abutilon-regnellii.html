<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant produces clusters of yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its hairy stems and foliage give it a distinctive, velvety appearance.</p>
<p>Abutilon regnellii is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive flowers and unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon regnellii has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 5 to 12 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is typically woody, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy, spreading manner.
