<p>Alternanthera maritima var. parvifolia, commonly known as salt marsh morning glory, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from pink to purple. The plant thrives in coastal wetlands and tidal areas, where it helps stabilize soil and support local biodiversity. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it often grows in dense mats.</p>
<p>This species is an important indicator of saltwater intrusion in estuarine ecosystems.</p>
