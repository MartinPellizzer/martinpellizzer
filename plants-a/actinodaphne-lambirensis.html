                <h1>Actinodaphne lambirensis</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne lambirensis, commonly known as the Lambirensis camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, leathery leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically green when mature and turn red upon ripening. It is valued for its essential oils, which are used in traditional medicine and perfumery.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne lambirensis has elliptical, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth upper surface and a slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, bark-like texture that is light brown in color, and it grows upright with some branching. The flowers are small, greenish-white structures with four petals, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, smooth drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne lambirensis is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, where it thrives in humid and warm climates. This species is commonly associated with lowland and hill forest areas. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a regionally significant plant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne lambirensis was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in low to mid-elevation areas, often near riverbanks or in forested landscapes. The plant is commonly found in Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It has been introduced to other regions for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and adaptability.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements and lack of natural dispersal mechanisms.</p>
