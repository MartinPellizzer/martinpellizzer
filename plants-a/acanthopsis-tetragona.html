                        <h1>Acanthopsis tetragona</h1>
<p>Acanthopsis tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled acanthus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive four-angled stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acanthopsis tetragona belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and algae that have a complex life cycle with a dominant sporophyte stage. Its class is Equisetopsida, which consists of ferns and their allies, characterized by their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Lamiales, a group of flowering plants that includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs, often with showy flowers. Its family is Acanthaceae, known for its distinctive flowers and often used in ornamental horticulture. Its genus is Acanthopsis, a small group of flowering plants typically found in tropical regions, with species often having spiny or toothed leaves.</p>
<p>Its species is Acanthopsis tetragona, a specific plant within the genus Acanthopsis, characterized by its unique morphology and habitat preferences.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopsis tetragona is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>It is found in the fynbos vegetation of this region. The plant thrives in the Mediterranean climate of the area. It is commonly found in rocky and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to the coastal and mountainous areas of the Cape Provinces.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopsis tetragona was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It has been observed in disturbed soils and along roadsides, often in areas with moderate to high sunlight exposure. The plant's introduction is likely due to human activities such as landscaping and accidental seed dispersal. It has shown adaptability to various soil types and can thrive in both coastal and inland environments.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to its relatively recent establishment in these regions.</p>
