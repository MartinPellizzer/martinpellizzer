<p>Adenostyles alliariae subsp.</p>
<p>alliariae, commonly known as the narrowleaf mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically features slender, grass-like leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It is characterized by its aromatic, pungent odor, which is due to the presence of sulfur-containing compounds.</p>
<p>The subspecies is closely related to other members of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many edible and economically important plants.</p>
