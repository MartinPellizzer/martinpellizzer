                        <h1>Acacia donnelliana</h1>
<p>Acacia donnelliana, commonly known as the white acacia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched structure and its distinctive, feathery leaves that are compound and alternate. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which bloom during the cooler months, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Acacia donnelliana is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia donnelliana is primarily native to eastern Australia, including the states of New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and rocky outcrops. This species thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is often associated with sandy or loamy soils and is well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Acacia donnelliana plays an important ecological role in its native range by providing habitat and food for various native animals.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia donnelliana was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various soil conditions.</p>
<p>It was initially brought in during the 19th century by early settlers who admired its aesthetic value. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has since become a weed in some areas, spreading aggressively and outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, as it can alter soil chemistry and reduce biodiversity in invaded habitats.</p>
<p>Efforts are now being made to control its spread and manage its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
