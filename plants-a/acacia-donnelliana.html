                <h1>Acacia donnelliana</h1>
<p>Acacia donnelliana, commonly known as the Donnell's wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Acacia donnelliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in horticulture for its hardy and drought-resistant nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia donnelliana has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, feathery leaflets arranged in a dense, fern-like pattern, typically measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are woody and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its yellowish-white flowers are arranged in globular heads, blooming from September to November, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a flat, pod-like structure containing seeds that are dispersed by wind due to their light, winged appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and taproot-like, helping the plant to access water in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia donnelliana is a shrub native to eastern Australia, specifically found in the states of New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions such as the Brigalow Belt and the Darling Downs, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils. This plant typically grows in open woodlands and grasslands, often in areas with low rainfall and high solar exposure. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acacia donnelliana is listed as vulnerable in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia donnelliana is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to Australia, known for its feathery foliage and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a period of cold stratification for optimal germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil, with minimal watering once established.</p>
<p>Regular fertilization in spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or rock roses enhances its ornamental value and supports a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia donnelliana is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich flowers. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants. Its deep root system also helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Overall, Acacia donnelliana plays a vital ecological role in maintaining biodiversity and soil health in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acacia donnelliana is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications.</p>
