                <h1>Actinea lanata</h1>
<p>Actinea lanata, commonly known as the woolly actinia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves that are covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Actinea lanata thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it contributes to local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea lanata has leaves that are broad, ovate, and hairy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, and covered with a rough, grayish bark that develops fissures with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea lanata is primarily native to the eastern United States, including regions such as Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This species is commonly associated with rich, organic soils and is part of the Ranunculaceae family. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats that provide the necessary moisture and light conditions.</p>
<p>Actinea lanata is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea lanata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fern-like foliage. Despite its beauty, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in forested regions.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists who are working to control its population.</p>
