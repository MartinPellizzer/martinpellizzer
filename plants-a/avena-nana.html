                    <h1>Avena nana</h1>
<p>Avena nana, commonly known as dwarf oat, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically reaches a height of less than 30 centimeters, making it ideal for ground cover in moist, shady environments. It is often found in woodland areas, along stream banks, and in other damp, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Avena nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
