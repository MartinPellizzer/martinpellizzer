<p>Asplenium × bavaricum nothosubsp.</p>
<p>bavaricum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival.</p>
