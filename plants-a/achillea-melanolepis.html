                <h1>Achillea melanolepis</h1>
<p>Achillea melanolepis, commonly known as lesser yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of tiny flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm, with gray-green, fern-like leaves and small white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Achillea melanolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea melanolepis has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a silvery-gray underside and a dark green top, arranged in a basal rosette, and are typically 5–10 cm long.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-green color, growing in a compact cluster with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, composite, and yellow in color, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea melanolepis is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, specifically found in parts of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions such as Greece, Turkey, and the Levant, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. This species typically grows in dry, open habitats like slopes, cliffs, and wastelands, often in well-drained soils. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, its limited distribution and habitat specificity make it vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea melanolepis is a hardy perennial plant known for its silver-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the rootstock in early spring. The growth cycle begins with new shoots in spring, followed by flowering in late summer, and it goes dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its compact shape.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs, and it pairs well with lavender and sage in companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
