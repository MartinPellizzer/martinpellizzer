<p>Aegiphila sessiliflora var. cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas' aegiphila, is a rare shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
