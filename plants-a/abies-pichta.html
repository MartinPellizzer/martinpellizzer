<p>Abies pichta, commonly known as the Siberian fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds surrounded by a papery wing. Its bark is typically thin and reddish-brown, becoming thicker and more furrowed with age.</p>
<p>The Siberian fir is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude forests, where it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem.</p>
