                <h1>Acrophorus javensis</h1>
<p>Acrophorus javensis, commonly known as the Java acanthus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves with a velvety texture. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, often with a distinctive spiky appearance.</p>
<p>Acrophorus javensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus javensis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and a fragrant aroma, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption and dropping.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and helping to absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus javensis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of these regions. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. Its distribution includes parts of the Philippines and parts of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora in these tropical ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus javensis was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Oceania.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal and lowland areas. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It has been introduced to several islands in the Pacific, including Hawaii and the Philippines, where it has established populations.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
