<p>Absinthium candidum, commonly known as common wormseed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds, which are often used in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Absinthium candidum is also known for its historical use in herbal remedies and as a component in some traditional tinctures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Absinthium candidum has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and upright, with a light green bark that becomes more woody as the plant matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during early summer, which are wind-pollinated and have a delicate structure of five petals. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a bract, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Absinthium candidum is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia, particularly in regions such as the Mediterranean Basin and parts of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is now distributed across a variety of habitats, including grasslands, meadows, and rocky areas, often in temperate climates. The plant typically grows at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it a common sight in open landscapes.</p>
<p>Currently, Absinthium candidum is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although habitat loss and land use changes pose potential threats to its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Absinthium candidum is a hardy perennial plant known for its medicinal and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle of Absinthium candidum involves a dormant period in winter, followed by rapid growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant. Fertilization with a balanced organic fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, and pruning dead foliage in late winter helps maintain its appearance. Common pests include aphids and slugs, while fungal diseases like root rot can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or chives can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>
