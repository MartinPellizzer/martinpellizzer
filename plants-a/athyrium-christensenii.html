<p>Athyrium christensenii, commonly known as the Christensen's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically evergreen. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
