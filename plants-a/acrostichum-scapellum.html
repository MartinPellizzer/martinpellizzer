                <h1>Acrostichum scapellum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum scapellum, commonly known as the dwarf hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows up to 1 meter in height, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for shaded or partially sunny environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum scapellum has leaves that are elongated, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branched. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, round drupe that contains one seed, dispersed by wind due to its feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and anchor itself in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum scapellum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. This fern thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its distribution includes countries like Brazil, Mexico, and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in some regions of the southeastern United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum scapellum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as landscaping and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent it from becoming a weed in natural areas.</p>
