                <h1>Acoelorraphe wrightii</h1>
<p>Acoelorraphe wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and typically grows on the branches of hardwood trees such as oaks and hickories. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, white or yellowish flowers that are often inconspicuous. Its berries are red or orange and serve as a food source for various birds and mammals.</p>
<p>Acoelorraphe wrightii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing sustenance and habitat for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoelorraphe wrightii has leaves that are alternate, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and covered with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoelorraphe wrightii is primarily native to the Bahamas, Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Florida, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Southeast, Nicaragua, and the Southwest Caribbean.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in coastal and wetland habitats across these regions. It thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. Acoelorraphe wrightii is known for its ability to tolerate saline and brackish water conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptation to tropical and subtropical coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoelorraphe wrightii was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, railroads, and abandoned fields. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has also been reported in parts of Texas and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
