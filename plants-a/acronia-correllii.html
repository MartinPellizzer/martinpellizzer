                <h1>Acronia correllii</h1>
<p>Acronia correllii, commonly known as the Florida acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal dunes of Florida.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it unique to its specific habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia correllii has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanging throughout the plant's life. Its flowers are clustered in racemes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia correllii is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically found in parts of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This plant is commonly associated with coastal dunes and maritime hammocks. It plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia correllii was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, ditches, and open woods. This plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often associated with areas that have been recently disturbed by human activity. It has become naturalized in certain regions, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive species in the area.</p>
