                    <h1>Acrocarpidium cordifolium f. minus</h1>
<p>Acrocarpidium cordifolium f. minus, commonly known as the small-heart leaf acrocarpidium, is a rare and lesser-known fern species characterized by its distinctive cordate (heart-shaped) leaves.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, with leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical form, hence the "minus" in its name. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a smooth, leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. The plant is often found in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its unique morphology and is of interest to researchers studying plant adaptation and evolutionary botany.</p>
