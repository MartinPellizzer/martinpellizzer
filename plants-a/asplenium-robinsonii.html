<p>Asplenium robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
