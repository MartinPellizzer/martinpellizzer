                <h1>Actinospermum angustifolium</h1>
<p>Actinospermum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved actinospermum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has a bushy, compact habit. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a distinct, pungent scent, while its flowers are white or pale yellow and attract various pollinators.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinospermum angustifolium has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with some branching. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinospermum angustifolium is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically found in the states of New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions and sandy soils along the eastern coastline. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often seen in heathlands and coastal dunes. It is well adapted to the local environmental conditions of these areas.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific regions within Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinospermum angustifolium was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, which contributes to its spread.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its distribution and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
