                        <h1>Acantholimon parsanum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon parsanum, commonly known as the Armenian sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acantholimon parsanum is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon parsanum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey, particularly in the Taurus Mountains.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of northern Syria and southern Iraq. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is adapted to the dry, cold conditions of its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon parsanum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and rocky substrates, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is often found in disturbed or open habitats such as slopes, gravelly soils, and roadside banks. Its introduction has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become established in these new environments, sometimes acting as an invasive species.</p>
