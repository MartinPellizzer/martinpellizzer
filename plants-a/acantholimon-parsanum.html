                        <h1>Acantholimon parsanum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon parsanum, commonly known as the Armenian sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acantholimon parsanum is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
