                <h1>Aegiphila sordida</h1>
<p>Aegiphila sordida, commonly known as the sordid aegiphila, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered in a fine, whitish coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aegiphila sordida is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila sordida has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and branching, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring tubular petals in shades of pink to purple, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to nutrient-poor soils and helping the plant anchor in rocky or arid environments.</p>
