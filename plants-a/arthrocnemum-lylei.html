                    <h1>Arthrocnemum lylei</h1>
<p>Arthrocnemum lylei, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to extreme environmental conditions. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in xerophytic gardens.</p>
