                <h1>Adenandra alba</h1>
<p>Adenandra alba, commonly known as the white adenandra, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its showy, white, cup-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects, making it an important plant in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Adenandra alba is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra alba has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale grey bark that exudes a mild aromatic scent when cut. Its small, clustered white flowers are fragrant, with five petals and stamens, blooming from late winter to early spring and attracting insect pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal ingestion and dropping.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra alba is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and along the southern coastline. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with rocky outcrops and coastal dunes. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Adenandra alba is an important component of the fynbos vegetation type in these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra alba was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it is commonly found in coastal areas and fynbos vegetation.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value due to its attractive white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and inland regions. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
