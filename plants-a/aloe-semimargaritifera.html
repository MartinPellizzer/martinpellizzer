                    <h1>Aloe semimargaritifera</h1>
<p>Aloe semimargaritifera, commonly known as the rock aloe or Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky soils, while its leaves store water efficiently.</p>
<p>Aloe semimargaritifera is valued for its resilience and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
