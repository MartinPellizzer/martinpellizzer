                <h1>Adenocalymma subincanum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma subincanum, commonly known as the silky sandbur, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, spiny fruits that aid in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are small and clustered in heads.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma subincanum is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma subincanum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a prostrate or ascending manner. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming during the spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma subincanum is primarily native to Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, and French Guiana.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in humid environments, often growing in dense forests or along riverbanks. Its distribution is closely linked to the specific ecological conditions of these regions.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the climate and soil types prevalent in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma subincanum was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as coastal dunes or disturbed sites.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and requires well-drained soil conditions. This plant is commonly found in the coastal zones of southern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and South Australia. It is often associated with maritime environments and can tolerate salt spray and wind exposure.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological niches that support its growth and survival.</p>
