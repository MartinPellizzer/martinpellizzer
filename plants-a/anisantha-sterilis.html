                <h1>Anisantha sterilis</h1>
<p>Anisantha sterilis, commonly known as the sterile anisantha, is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in temperate regions, often in moist or disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable seeds, making it a unique subject in botanical studies.</p>
