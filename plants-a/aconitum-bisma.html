                <h1>Aconitum bisma</h1>
<p>Aconitum bisma, commonly known as the Himalayan aconite, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments, and it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Aconitum bisma contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum bisma has large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, and have a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, covered with a rough, bark-like texture, and has a bluish-green color. The flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a tall spire-like structure, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum bisma is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky soils at high elevations. This plant is commonly associated with mountain meadows and slopes where the climate is cool and moist. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Aconitum bisma is an important component of the flora in these remote and ecologically significant areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum bisma was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in mountainous or woodland regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. This plant is known for its striking blue or purple flowers and is commonly used in ornamental gardening. It has been introduced to several countries in Europe and North America for its aesthetic value.</p>
