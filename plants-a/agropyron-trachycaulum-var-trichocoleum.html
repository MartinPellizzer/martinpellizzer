                    <h1>Agropyron trachycaulum var. trichocoleum</h1>
<p>Agropyron trachycaulum var. trichocoleum, commonly known as the rough bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which makes it well-suited for dry, rocky soils. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
