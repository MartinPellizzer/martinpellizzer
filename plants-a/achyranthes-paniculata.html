                <h1>Achyranthes paniculata</h1>
<p>Achyranthes paniculata, commonly known as the Indian knotgrass, is a flowering plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are clustered inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Achyranthes paniculata is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes paniculata has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually 5-10 cm long and 2-4 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, clustered in panicles, and bloom from July to September; they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, ellipsoid seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in soil and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes paniculata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open fields, forest edges, and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across various countries in the Indian subcontinent and East Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes paniculata was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and northern Australia. This plant is often spread through human activities such as agriculture, gardening, and land development. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in many areas where it is not native.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to outcompete native plants, it can significantly alter local ecosystems.</p>
