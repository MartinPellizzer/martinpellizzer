<p>Alchornea obovata, commonly known as the broadleaf alchornea, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in axillary clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
