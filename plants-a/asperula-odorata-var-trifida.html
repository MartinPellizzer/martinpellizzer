                    <h1>Asperula odorata var. trifida</h1>
<p>Asperula odorata var. trifida, commonly known as the fragrant woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its pleasant scent and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
