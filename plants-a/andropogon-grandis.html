<p>Andropogon grandis, commonly known as big bluestem, is a tall, perennial grass native to the tallgrass prairies of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its blue-gray-green foliage and a distinctive, hollow stem that becomes more reddish in color as it matures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or brown, depending on the season.
