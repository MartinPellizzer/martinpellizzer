                <h1>Acer opalus subsp. hispanicum</h1>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the genus *Acer* in the family Sapindaceae, characterized by its palmate leaves and distinctive bark.</p>
<p>The species is known for its bright yellow foliage in autumn, which contributes to its ornamental value. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub with a spreading habit.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicum is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in southern Spain. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Sierra de Gredos and other mountainous regions of central and southern Spain.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates, growing in rocky soils and open woodlands. This subspecies is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss and climate change, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicum is a decorative tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and compact size, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings offering a more reliable method for maintaining the desired characteristics.</p>
<p>This species has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity within 10 to 15 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicum is a valuable plant in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the local pollination network.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity and ecological stability. Its root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports the overall health of the ecosystem by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicum is a lesser-known tree species primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture and landscaping due to its striking autumn foliage. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its wood has been historically utilized in small-scale carpentry and crafts.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it has been occasionally referenced for its potential astringent properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions of southern Europe, where it is admired for its aesthetic appeal and resilience.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems also supports local biodiversity, making it an important species for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicum has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Atrosanguineum' with its striking red foliage and 'Variegatum' featuring variegated leaves. It is also frequently used in hybridization with other maple species, leading to the development of unique forms with enhanced traits such as improved cold hardiness or more vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>These hybrids are often sought after by horticulturists for their adaptability to different climates and garden settings. The species' horticultural importance lies in its ability to provide year-round visual interest and its role in expanding the palette of available maple cultivars.</p>
<p>Its popularity in landscaping and garden design further underscores its significance in modern horticulture.</p>
