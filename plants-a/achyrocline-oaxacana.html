                <h1>Achyrocline oaxacana</h1>
<p>Achyrocline oaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxaca chamaedorea, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline oaxacana has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered with fine hairs, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white to pale blue petals that bloom during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, rocky soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline oaxacana is primarily native to Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the southern and central regions of the country, particularly in the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and parts of the Yucat√°n Peninsula. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is commonly found in lowland and mountainous areas. The species is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and cleared forests.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline oaxacana was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions and disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it suitable for regions with warm temperatures and high humidity. Its distribution has expanded due to human activity, including landscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native flora.</p>
