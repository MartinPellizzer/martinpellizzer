                <h1>Adiantum celebicum</h1>
<p>Adiantum celebicum, commonly known as the Celebes maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistently moist soil to flourish. Its intricate leaf structure and elegant appearance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Adiantum celebicum is also valued for its ability to purify the air and enhance the aesthetic appeal of its surroundings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum celebicum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically slender, ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, and have a light green color that may turn slightly brown at the edges. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a creeping or clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures rather than true flowers, and its reproductive cycle relies on spore dispersal through wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, aiding in nutrient absorption and anchoring the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum celebicum is primarily native to Sulawesi.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of this Indonesian island. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous areas. It is commonly associated with rocky or wooded habitats.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to Sulawesi, where it thrives in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum celebicum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and along stream banks. This fern has become established in both natural and disturbed habitats within the region. Its introduction is believed to be due to accidental dispersal through human activities.</p>
<p>Adiantum celebicum has shown adaptability to local climate conditions and has become a notable part of the regional flora.</p>
