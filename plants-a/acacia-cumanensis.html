<p>Acacia cumanensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various native species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia cumanensis is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions such as Queensland, New South Wales, and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in sandy soils along coastal and inland regions. This species thrives in open woodlands, grasslands, and heathlands, often in areas with a warm climate and well-drained soil. It is also occasionally found in parts of Southeast Asia, though its primary distribution remains in Australia.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia cumanensis was mainly introduced to areas with a warm, dry climate and well-drained soils, often found in coastal regions and inland dunes.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high sunlight exposure and is commonly found in semi-arid and arid zones. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has been associated with both ecological benefits and potential invasiveness in certain regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been spread across several countries in Africa and the Middle East.</p>
