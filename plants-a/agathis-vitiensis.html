<p>Agathis vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the South Pacific, particularly found in parts of Fiji and Tonga.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araucariaceae and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces large, conifer-like cones and has a slow growth rate, making it valuable for timber and ecological purposes.</p>
<p>Its wood is highly resistant to decay, which contributes to its historical use in construction and shipbuilding.</p>
