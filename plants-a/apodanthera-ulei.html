                    <h1>Apodanthera ulei</h1>
<p>Apodanthera ulei, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species known for their milky sap. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with narrow, gray-green leaves and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale pink. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions by storing water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Apodanthera ulei plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as widely cultivated as other milkweed species.</p>
