                    <h1>Arceuthobium pini</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium pini, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests coniferous trees such as pines.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, attaching itself to the host's stem or branches. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with both the host tree and the birds that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Arceuthobium pini plays a significant role in forest ecosystems, influencing tree growth and biodiversity.</p>
