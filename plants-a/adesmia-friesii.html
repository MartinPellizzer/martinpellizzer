                <h1>Adesmia friesii</h1>
<p>Adesmia friesii, commonly known as the Mexican thornbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and thorny stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Adesmia friesii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to stabilize soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia friesii has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a spreading pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia friesii is primarily native to Argentina Northwest.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly seen in shrublands and dry grasslands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the northwest part of Argentina.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia friesii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and degraded grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and full sun exposure. The plant is commonly found in the Mediterranean climate zones of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
