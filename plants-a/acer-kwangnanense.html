                <h1>Acer kwangnanense</h1>
<p>Acer kwangnanense, commonly known as the Guangnan maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The tree produces samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer kwangnanense has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length; they are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, with two winged seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer kwangnanense is a deciduous tree native to China, specifically found in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to fragmented areas within these regions, where it grows in mountainous terrain. It thrives in humid, temperate environments with well-drained soil, typically found in forested areas. This species is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer kwangnanense is considered to be of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer kwangnanense is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry spells. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune to shape the tree and remove dead wood.</p>
<p>It is relatively pest and disease-resistant, though it may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, and is best planted with companion species like azaleas or rhododendrons for aesthetic and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer kwangnanense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and supporting other plant life. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which helps bind the soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer kwangnanense contributes to carbon sequestration, offering long-term ecological benefits to its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer kwangnanense is a lesser-known species of maple native to China, primarily found in the mountainous regions of Guangxi and Guizhou.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been traditionally used in Chinese medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The tree's ornamental value contributes to its role in horticulture and landscape design, supporting local economies through the sale of plants and seeds. Culturally, it is sometimes regarded as a symbol of resilience and natural beauty in regional folklore.</p>
<p>However, due to its limited distribution and lack of commercial cultivation, its industrial and economic impact remains minimal.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer kwangnanense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson Queen' and 'Red Sunset', known for their striking autumn foliage. Hybrids of Acer kwangnanense are often created to enhance color, growth habit, and hardiness for garden use. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>They are widely cultivated in parks and private gardens for their visual impact during the fall season.</p>
