                <h1>Acer kwangnanense</h1>
<p>Acer kwangnanense, commonly known as the Guangnan maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant autumn foliage, which displays shades of red, orange, and yellow. The tree typically grows to a height of 10–15 meters, with a broad, rounded crown. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with serrated margins and a deep green color during the growing season.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its seasonal beauty.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer kwangnanense has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light gray bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer kwangnanense is a deciduous tree native to China, specifically found in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in the mountainous regions of southern and western China. This species thrives in temperate environments with well-drained soil and moderate rainfall. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, Acer kwangnanense is considered a rare species and is listed as endangered in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer kwangnanense is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for better germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may benefit from companion plants like lavender or ornamental grasses to enhance its growth environment.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer kwangnanense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for maintaining healthy plant populations. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape and protecting water quality.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer kwangnanense plays a role in carbon sequestration, enhancing the overall ecological balance of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
