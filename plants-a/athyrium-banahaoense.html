<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, aiding in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
