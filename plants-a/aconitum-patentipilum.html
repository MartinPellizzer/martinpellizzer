                <h1>Aconitum patentipilum</h1>
<p>Aconitum patentipilum, commonly known as the slender aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes along the stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Aconitum patentipilum belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant of both botanical interest and caution.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum patentipilum has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are broadly ovate to reniform in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring up to 15 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in clustered racemes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black, oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving harsh conditions.</p>
