<p>Adiantum incisum, commonly known as the cut-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that are finely divided and often have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is typically found in woodland areas. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a distinctive, serrated edge.</p>
<p>Adiantum incisum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum incisum has delicate, finely divided leaves that are pinnate and deeply lobed, with a bright green color and a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a light brown, smooth bark. This fern does not produce flowers; instead, it reproduces via spores, and its fronds bear sporangia on the underside. The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This fern thrives in areas with rich, well-drained soil and high humidity. Its distribution extends from New York through Pennsylvania and into parts of Virginia and North Carolina.</p>
<p>Adiantum incisum is often associated with rocky outcrops and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum incisum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and indoor gardening due to its attractive, delicate foliage.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value, featuring finely divided, lace-like fronds that add a touch of elegance to gardens and interiors. This plant is typically grown as a container plant, making it suitable for both outdoor and indoor environments.
