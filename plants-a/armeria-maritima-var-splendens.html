                    <h1>Armeria maritima var. splendens</h1>
<p>Armeria maritima var. splendens, commonly known as the showy thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces dense clusters of pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and salt tolerance make it well-suited for coastal gardens and rockeries.</p>
<p>The foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year.</p>
