                    <h1>Anemia nervosa</h1>
<p>Anemia nervosa, commonly known as neurasthenia, is not a botanical term but a historical medical condition.</p>
<p>It was once thought to be caused by a deficiency in vital energy or nerve strength. The term "anemia nervosa" suggests a connection to nervous system health rather than actual blood-related deficiencies. Botanically, it has no relevance to plant species or botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>This condition is now understood to be related to mental health rather than botanical science.</p>
