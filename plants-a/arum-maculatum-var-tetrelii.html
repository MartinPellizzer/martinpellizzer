                    <h1>Arum maculatum var. tetrelii</h1>
<p>Arum maculatum var. tetrelii, commonly known as the purple arum, is a striking plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple, waxy leaves and a distinctive spathe that encloses a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered on the spadix, which are pollinated by various insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses, though it requires careful management to prevent invasiveness.</p>
