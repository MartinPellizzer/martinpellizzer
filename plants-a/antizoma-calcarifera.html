                    <h1>Antizoma calcarifera</h1>
<p>Antizoma calcarifera, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and rocky environments, where it forms a crust-like structure on stone surfaces. The plant's morphology includes a dense, leathery thallus that helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and stabilization in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator of air quality.</p>
