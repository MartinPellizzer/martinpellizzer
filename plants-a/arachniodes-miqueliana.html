<p>Arachniodes miqueliana, commonly known as the Miquel's spider fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble spider webs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
