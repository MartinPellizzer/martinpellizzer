                    <h1>Agostana</h1>
<p>Agostana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood with a rich, reddish-brown color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. Agostana is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
