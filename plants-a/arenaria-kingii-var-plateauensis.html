                    <h1>Arenaria kingii var. plateauensis</h1>
<p>Arenaria kingii var. plateauensis, commonly known as the Sierra sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-elevation regions of the Sierra Nevada in California.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its alpine habitat. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in the arid environment.</p>
<p>This variety is part of the Caryophyllaceae family and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas.</p>
