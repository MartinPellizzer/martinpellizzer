                <h1>Acer tataricum f. rotundifolium</h1>
<p>Acer tataricum f. rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf maple, is a distinctive variation of the Tatarian maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, thick leaves that are often larger and more heart-shaped compared to the typical species. The plant is native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea, and thrives in temperate climates. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. rotundifolium has round or heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length and a deep green color during the growing season.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with a structure consisting of four sepals and four petals, and it is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed dispersal unit, which is dispersed by wind, allowing the seeds to travel considerable distances.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. rotundifolium is a rare variant of the Tatarian maple, native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific areas in Romania and Ukraine, where it grows in rocky, forested environments. It thrives in temperate climates, typically at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population size, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. rotundifolium is a compact, rounded shrub known for its uniquely shaped, rounded leaves and vibrant autumn colors.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings taken in late spring or hardwood cuttings in late autumn. This plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 5 to 10 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, preferring full sun to partial shade. Fertilize it lightly in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune dead or damaged branches in late winter to maintain its shape.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects; companion planting with lavender or marigold can help deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. rotundifolium is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its dense foliage. The plant also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil quality and offering habitat for insects and other small creatures.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. rotundifolium is a decorative plant commonly used in horticulture for its attractive, rounded leaves and ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its foliage can be used in some traditional herbal teas.
