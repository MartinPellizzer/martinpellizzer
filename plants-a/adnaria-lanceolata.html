                <h1>Adnaria lanceolata</h1>
<p>Adnaria lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed adnaria, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Adnaria lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria lanceolata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and measure approximately 5-10 cm in length with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria lanceolata is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, rocky shores, and shallow marine environments. This plant thrives in temperate climates with moderate salinity levels. It is often associated with sandy or gravelly substrates in intertidal zones.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological conditions of the Mediterranean Sea and adjacent coastal waters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria lanceolata was mainly introduced to coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea, particularly in regions with shallow, sandy substrates.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, saline environments and is often found in estuaries and brackish waters. The plant's introduction has been linked to human activities such as aquaculture and coastal development. It has shown rapid growth and competitive ability, leading to concerns about its impact on native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential, it provides habitat for certain marine organisms and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
