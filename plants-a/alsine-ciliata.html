                    <h1>Alsine ciliata</h1>
<p>Alsine ciliata, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves with fine, silky hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Alsine ciliata is often found in dunes, gravelly slopes, and along the edges of salt marshes.</p>
