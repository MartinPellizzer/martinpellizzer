                    <h1>Anthurium pulchellum</h1>
<p>Anthurium pulchellum, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped bracts that range in color from deep red to orange, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Anthurium pulchellum is popular as a houseplant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
