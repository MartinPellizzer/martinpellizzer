                    <h1>Aira juncifolia</h1>
<p>Aira juncifolia, commonly known as slender wood grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Aira juncifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
