<p>Asplenium mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium mexicanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
