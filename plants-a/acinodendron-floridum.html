                <h1>Acinodendron floridum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron floridum, commonly known as the Florida acinodendron, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer months, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron floridum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that exudes a mild fragrance when broken, and it grows in a trailing or ascending manner along the ground. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white to pale yellow petals and a distinct, tubular corolla, blooming in spring and attracting pollinators like bees through nectar secretion.</p>
<p>The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, while the roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron floridum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This plant is commonly found in the Everglades and other tropical wetlands of the region. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its native range is largely restricted to the subtropical and tropical climates of the southeastern U.S.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron floridum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt natural habitats.</p>
