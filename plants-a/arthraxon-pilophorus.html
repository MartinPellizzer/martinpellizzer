<p>Arthraxon pilophorus, commonly known as the hairy tongue grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>Arthraxon pilophorus is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
