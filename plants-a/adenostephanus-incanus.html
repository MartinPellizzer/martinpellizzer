                <h1>Adenostephanus incanus</h1>
<p>Adenostephanus incanus, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is typically found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a low-growing habit with a rosette of leaves and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Adenostephanus incanus is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostephanus incanus has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostephanus incanus is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. This plant thrives in areas with mild, wet winters and dry summers. It is often associated with rocky soils and coastal bluffs.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within California, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostephanus incanus was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activities such as landscaping or accidental transport. This plant has since become established in disturbed areas and open habitats. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
