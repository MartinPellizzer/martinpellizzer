                    <h1>Athyrium wardii var. densipinnum</h1>
<p>Athyrium wardii var. densipinnum, commonly known as the dense-pinnate lady fern, is a variant of the lady fern genus characterized by its dense, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile ones in the second.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds and are covered by a kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
