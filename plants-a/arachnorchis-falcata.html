<p>Arachnorchis falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its striking, spider-like flowers that are typically pale yellow with darker markings. The plant blooms during late winter to early spring, often in response to rainfall. It prefers well-drained soils in open habitats such as heathlands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
