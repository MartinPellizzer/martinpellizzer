<p>Acacia decipiens var. incrassata, commonly known as the thick-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are broader and more robust than those of the typical acacia species. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine.</p>
