<p>Angraecum pingue, commonly known as the sticky angraecum, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a distinct yellowish throat. Its epiphytic nature means it grows on trees or rocks rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Angraecum pingue is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
