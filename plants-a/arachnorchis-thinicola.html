<p>Arachnorchis thinicola, commonly known as the slender spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the trunks or branches of rainforest trees, relying on its host for physical support rather than soil. The plant produces delicate, spider-like flowers with a unique coloration pattern, often featuring shades of pink and white. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
