                <h1>Adonis ceretana</h1>
<p>Adonis ceretana, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking yellow flowers with a bell-shaped corolla. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is known for its early spring blooming habit, often appearing before other flowering plants.</p>
<p>Adonis ceretana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis ceretana has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age, and it grows in a upright, branching pattern. The flowers are yellow and consist of five petals, with a prominent central stigma, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis ceretana is primarily native to Spain.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions across the Iberian Peninsula. This plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils. It is commonly seen in mountainous areas and open habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Spain.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis ceretana was mainly introduced to specific regions in the Mediterranean and parts of Europe for ornamental purposes due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open areas, often along roadsides and in urban environments. The plant has been reported in several countries including Spain, Italy, and France, where it has established itself in natural and semi-natural habitats.
