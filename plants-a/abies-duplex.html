<p>Abies duplex, commonly known as the double fir, is a rare and unique conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two-tiered branching pattern, which gives it a visually striking appearance. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a dense, compact manner. Its cones are small and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, Abies duplex is considered an endangered species.</p>
