                        <h1>Abies duplex</h1>
<p>Abies duplex, commonly known as the double fir, is a rare and unique conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two-tiered branching pattern, which gives it a visually striking appearance. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a dense, compact manner. Its cones are small and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, Abies duplex is considered an endangered species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies duplex is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, including parts of the Carpathian Mountains and the Alps.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist climates at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. This species is commonly found in mixed forests alongside other coniferous trees such as fir and spruce. Its natural habitat includes well-drained soils and areas with moderate sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Abies duplex is an important component of the temperate forest ecosystems in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies duplex was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is often found in areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. This species is commonly used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive conical shape and evergreen foliage. It has been introduced to several countries, including parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
