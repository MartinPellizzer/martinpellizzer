                <h1>Achillea sambucifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea sambucifolia, commonly known as the wood avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of fern-like, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to pale green flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sambucifolia has leaves that are broad, lance-shaped, and have a silver-gray underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a rough texture, with a light green to reddish-brown color. The flowers are white with yellow centers, arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sambucifolia is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and dry habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and wastelands. This plant thrives in regions with mild, temperate climates and is often associated with coastal and mountainous areas. It is also present in parts of the Middle East and western Asia.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with low rainfall and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sambucifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in during the late 19th century as part of early botanical introductions for horticultural purposes. The plant is now found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. It has become naturalized in some areas, though it is not considered invasive.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its introduced range.</p>
