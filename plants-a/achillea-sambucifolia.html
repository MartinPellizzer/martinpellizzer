                <h1>Achillea sambucifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea sambucifolia, commonly known as the sweet everlasting, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, white to pale yellow hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are finely divided, lance-shaped, and often emit a faintly aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Achillea sambucifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sambucifolia has basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are green with a white underside, arranged in a rosette and reaching up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-brown bark, growing from the base of the plant. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sambucifolia is a perennial herb native to southern Europe, specifically found in regions such as Italy, France, and Spain.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Mediterranean Basin, where it thrives in dry, rocky, and gravelly soils. This plant typically grows in open habitats like slopes, cliffs, and grasslands, often in sunny and well-drained environments. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Despite its limited range, Achillea sambucifolia is currently listed as least concern by the IUCN, though habitat loss poses a potential threat to its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea sambucifolia is a hardy perennial known for its fragrant foliage and striking purple flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the rhizomes in early spring. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, producing flowers and seeds in its second year before dying back.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help repel pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea sambucifolia is a perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small birds, which rely on its flowers and foliage for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by attracting beneficial insects. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea sambucifolia is a lesser-known plant with limited culinary use, though its leaves may be used in some traditional herbal infusions.</p>
<p>Historically, it has been used in folk medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. While not widely cultivated for industrial purposes, it may contribute to ecological systems by supporting pollinators. Its cultural significance is not well-documented, but it may hold symbolic value in local traditions.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications remain largely underexplored compared to more widely studied plants.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea sambucifolia has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Cerulean' and 'Purpurea,' which are known for their striking blue and purple flower heads, respectively. While natural hybrids of this species are less common, horticulturists have developed selections that enhance color and bloom duration. These cultivars are valued for their drought tolerance and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to their visual appeal and low maintenance, Achillea sambucifolia and its cultivars hold significant horticultural importance in gardens and landscapes.</p>
