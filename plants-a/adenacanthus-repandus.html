                <h1>Adenacanthus repandus</h1>
<p>Adenacanthus repandus, commonly known as the rough-haircup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, hairy stems that grow upright and bear small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Adenacanthus repandus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering habit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenacanthus repandus has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are serrated and have a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that has a slightly fibrous texture. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and have a pale greenish-white color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenacanthus repandus is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it occurs in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in coastal and mountainous regions. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often growing in open woodlands or along coastal cliffs. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Adenacanthus repandus is considered endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenacanthus repandus is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to South Africa, known for its spiny foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. The growth cycle of Adenacanthus repandus is typically slow to moderate, with new growth appearing in spring and blooming in summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourage flowering. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or sedum can enhance its growth and provide a more balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenacanthus repandus is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to soil health by acting as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the surrounding environment.</p>
