                <h1>Adenacanthus repandus</h1>
<p>Adenacanthus repandus, commonly known as the narrowleaf adenacanthus, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along its stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Adenacanthus repandus is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in woodland edges.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenacanthus repandus has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually green with a slight pubescence on the underside, measuring up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are erect and branching, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming in spring and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenacanthus repandus is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and ample sunlight. This plant is commonly found in rainforests and secondary growth areas. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to these specific geographic regions due to its particular environmental requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenacanthus repandus was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes where it is cultivated for its aesthetic value. Despite its ornamental use, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. The plant is native to southern Africa but has been introduced to other regions, including parts of the United States.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to areas where it is intentionally planted, though it can spread through seed dispersal.</p>
