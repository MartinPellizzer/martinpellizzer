<p>Acer palmatum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet, with a spreading or upright form depending on the variety. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces samaras, or winged seeds, for dispersal.</p>
<p>Acer palmatum thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes.</p>
