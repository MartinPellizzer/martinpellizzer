<p>Achnatherum haussknechtii, commonly known as the Hausknecht's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil, making it a resilient component of steppe and desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important forage plant for livestock in its native range.</p>
