                <h1>Achnatherum haussknechtii</h1>
<p>Achnatherum haussknechtii, commonly known as the Hausknecht's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil, making it a resilient component of steppe and desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important forage plant for livestock in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum haussknechtii has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green to brownish color, growing upright and branching from the base. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to yellowish florets, blooming in early summer, and are primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-angled achene, dispersed by wind due to its light weight and hair-like structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum haussknechtii is primarily native to Iran.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or steppe environments. It is adapted to the dry climate and can withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Iran where the environmental conditions are suitable for its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum haussknechtii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and degraded grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in states like California, Nevada, and Utah. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including land development and transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in many disturbed environments.</p>
