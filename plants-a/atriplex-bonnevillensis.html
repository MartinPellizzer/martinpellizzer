<p>Atriplex bonnevillensis, commonly known as the Bonneville saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing coastal and desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant's extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion and supports biodiversity in harsh landscapes.</p>
