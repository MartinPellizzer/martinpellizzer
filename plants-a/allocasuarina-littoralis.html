                    <h1>Allocasuarina littoralis</h1>
<p>Allocasuarina littoralis, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique cylindrical, spike-like foliage that resembles the structure of a pine cone, composed of modified leaves called phyllodes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain seeds. It is highly adaptable to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray, wind, and sandy soils.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
