<p>Acanthophyllum brevibracteatum, commonly known as the short-bracteed thornbush, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the brief growing season. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can survive in areas with extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a vital role in stabilizing desert ecosystems and preventing soil erosion.</p>
