<p>Asteriscus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal aster, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salty air and wind exposure. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and purple, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Asteriscus littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small insects and birds.</p>
