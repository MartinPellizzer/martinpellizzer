                            <h1>Agrostis Maritima Var. Clementei</h1>
<p>Coastal grass, scientifically known as Agrostis maritima var. clementei, is a hardy plant that thrives in the challenging conditions of coastal environments. This variety of coastal grass is particularly adapted to salt spray, sandy soils, and strong winds, making it a common sight along shorelines. Its ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions highlights its ecological importance in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. With its low-growing, tufted form, it plays a vital role in maintaining the balance of coastal ecosystems. Despite its resilience, this plant remains a symbol of nature's adaptability in extreme habitats.</p>
