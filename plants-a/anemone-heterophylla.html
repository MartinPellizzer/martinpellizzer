                <h1>Anemone heterophylla</h1>
<p>Anemone heterophylla, commonly known as the variable anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that vary in size and shape depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces showy, white to pinkish flowers with five to eight petal-like sepals that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its variability in leaf morphology makes it a unique subject for botanical study.</p>
