                <h1>Acranthera collina</h1>
<p>Acranthera collina, commonly known as the narrowleaf acranthera, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, slender stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acranthera collina is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera collina has leaves that are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, arranged in clusters, and have a tubular shape; they bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera collina is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of Southeast Asia. This plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, typically growing in the understorey of dense forest canopies. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its small, delicate flowers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acranthera collina is considered a rare and threatened species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera collina was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Iridaceae. The introduction of Acranthera collina is believed to have occurred through accidental transport, possibly via contaminated soil or plant material. It is now considered a potential invasive species in certain regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still under study.</p>
