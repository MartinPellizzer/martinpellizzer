                <h1>Acinodendron spennerostachyum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron spennerostachyum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a tropical tree native to regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered, often producing a distinctive fragrance.</p>
<p>The fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron spennerostachyum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and has a light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing in a straight, upright pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in tropical regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron spennerostachyum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This species thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall. It is often associated with disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic locations within the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron spennerostachyum was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in warm, humid environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and ample sunlight. The plant has been introduced to several parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
