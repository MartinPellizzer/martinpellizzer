                    <h1>Arenaria foliacea</h1>
<p>Arenaria foliacea, commonly known as sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense mat-forming structure, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which reduces water loss and protects against strong winds.</p>
<p>Arenaria foliacea is often found in open habitats such as tundra, coastal dunes, and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
