                <h1>Acinodendron cruentum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron cruentum, commonly known as the bloodroot tree, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive red-orange sap, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in complex inflorescences.</p>
<p>Acinodendron cruentum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron cruentum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are medium in size, dark green on top, and paler underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a compact, upright form. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron cruentum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and lowland areas with high humidity. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary growth habitats. It is also present in some parts of India and northern Australia.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to regions with a warm, moist climate.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron cruentum was mainly introduced to coastal and inland areas with sandy soils, particularly in regions with a warm, temperate climate.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and dunes. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces, making it a successful invasive species in certain ecosystems. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in landscaping in some regions.</p>
