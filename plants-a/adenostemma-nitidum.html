                <h1>Adenostemma nitidum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma nitidum, commonly known as the smooth adenostemma, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and typically grows as an erect, herbaceous perennial. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Its showy, tubular flowers are usually pink or red, arranged in whorled clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Adenostemma nitidum is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma nitidum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 2-6 cm in length, with a glossy, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a bushy, branched pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from summer to autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma nitidum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, savannas, and along the edges of forests. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Adenostemma nitidum is known for its erect growth habit and showy yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma nitidum was mainly introduced to areas where it can thrive in disturbed soils and full sun, often along roadsides and in open fields.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with warm climates and low rainfall, such as parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in regions where it has established itself.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential, it is sometimes used for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage.</p>
