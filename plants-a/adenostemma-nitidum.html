                <h1>Adenostemma nitidum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma nitidum, commonly known as the smooth adenostemma, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“100 cm and features erect, branching stems covered with smooth, glabrous bark. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Adenostemma nitidum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma nitidum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth, glossy surface and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from summer to autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma nitidum is a flowering plant native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it occurs in the eastern and western regions.</p>
<p>Currently, it is also found in parts of Australia, especially in Queensland and New South Wales, where it has been introduced. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils in open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and coastal areas. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to about 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Adenostemma nitidum is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not currently facing significant threats to its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenostemma nitidum is a flowering plant known for its resilience and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for faster growth. The plant has an annual growth cycle, blooming in summer and completing its life cycle within a single growing season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning after flowering promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot under poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>
