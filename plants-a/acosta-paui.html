                    <h1>Acosta paui</h1>
<p>Acosta paui, commonly known as the pink spider orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spider-like appearance with elongated petals and a distinctive pink hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers bloom in late summer and are pollinated by small insects, making it an important component of its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acosta paui is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
