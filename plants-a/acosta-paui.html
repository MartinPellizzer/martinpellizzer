                <h1>Acosta paui</h1>
<p>Acosta paui, commonly known as the pink spider orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spider-like appearance with elongated petals and a distinctive pink hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers bloom in late summer and are pollinated by small insects, making it an important component of its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acosta paui is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta paui has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth in texture, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta paui is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in cloud forests and montane habitats at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed areas within its native range.</p>
<p>Acosta paui is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the unique climatic conditions of the Andes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta paui was mainly introduced to new habitats in South America, particularly in regions with high humidity and rich soil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Amazon basin and other tropical lowland areas. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant flowers. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, careful management is needed to prevent it from becoming invasive.</p>
