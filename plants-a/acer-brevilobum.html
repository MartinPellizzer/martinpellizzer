                <h1>Acer brevilobum</h1>
<p>Acer brevilobum, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves, and it produces samaras for seed dispersal.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer brevilobum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–10 cm long and 3–6 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer brevilobum is a species of maple native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, specifically found in parts of British Columbia and Washington State.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the western United States. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in coniferous or mixed forests, often in areas with high humidity. This species typically grows at elevations between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Acer brevilobum is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer brevilobum is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves rapid growth in spring and summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization should be minimal to avoid stressing the tree, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead branches.</p>
<p>Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while diseases like verticillium wilt can affect it, making companion planting with native plants beneficial for pest control and soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer brevilobum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity through its canopy structure. Its roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in forested areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil quality by adding organic matter as it decomposes.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer brevilobum is a species of maple native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, known for its ecological and aesthetic value.</p>
<p>While its leaves and seeds are not commonly used in culinary applications, the tree provides habitat and food for various wildlife species. Historically, Indigenous communities have used parts of the tree for medicinal purposes, such as treating respiratory issues and skin conditions. The tree's ornamental value contributes to its role in landscaping and urban forestry.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance for some First Nations groups, representing resilience and connection to the land.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer brevilobum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame,' which are known for their striking fall color. Hybrids of Acer brevilobum, such as those with Acer circinatum, often exhibit enhanced hardiness and a wider range of leaf colors. These cultivars and hybrids play a significant role in horticulture, especially in landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>Their aesthetic appeal makes them popular choices for ornamental trees in temperate climates.</p>
