                    <h1>Alopecurus glomeratus</h1>
<p>Alopecurus glomeratus, commonly known as mouse grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, dark green leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and meadows. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Alopecurus glomeratus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
