                <h1>Acrostichum ramentaceum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum ramentaceum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum ramentaceum is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in tropical ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ramentaceum has leaves that are sword-shaped, arranged in a compact rosette, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows from the base of the plant. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered together, typically in shades of greenish-yellow, blooming in the spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds through wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out just below the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ramentaceum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in coastal forests and mangrove swamps, where it plays a vital role in the local ecosystem. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be found in disturbed habitats near human settlements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ramentaceum was mainly introduced to new environments as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several tropical and subtropical regions outside its native range. The introduction often occurs through horticultural trade or accidental transport. Its establishment in non-native areas can pose a risk to local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Careful monitoring is recommended to prevent its spread and potential displacement of native vegetation.</p>
