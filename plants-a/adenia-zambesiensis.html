                <h1>Adenia zambesiensis</h1>
<p>Adenia zambesiensis, commonly known as the Zambesi adenium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, vibrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It is often found in rocky or dry habitats, adapting well to arid conditions.</p>
<p>Adenia zambesiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia zambesiensis has elliptical,革质 (leathery) leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to reddish-brown in color. Its flowers are large, showy, and consist of a spathaceous bract enclosing a cluster of yellowish-green floral buds, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and helping it to absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia zambesiensis is primarily native to Mozambique.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the eastern and central regions of the country. This plant thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with forested areas and riverine habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the natural ecosystems of Mozambique.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia zambesiensis was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests or along riverbanks. This plant is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses due to its ornamental value and unique foliage. Its introduction has been driven by horticultural interest and the search for exotic plant species.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely naturalized in the wild outside its native range.</p>
