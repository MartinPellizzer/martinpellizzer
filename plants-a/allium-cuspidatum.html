                    <h1>Allium cuspidatum</h1>
<p>Allium cuspidatum, commonly known as the purple onion or purple garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of violet or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant's bulbs are edible, though they have a more intense flavor compared to common onions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>Allium cuspidatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
