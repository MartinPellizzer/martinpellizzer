                    <h1>Asclepias media</h1>
<p>Asclepias media, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It features upright stems that bear clusters of showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers, which attract a variety of pollinators. The plant produces distinctive seed pods called follicles, which split open to release silky-haired seeds. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a waxy coating and have a milky sap that is toxic to some animals.</p>
<p>Asclepias media plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host plant for their larvae.</p>
