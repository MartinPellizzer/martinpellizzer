                    <h1>Ananas sativus var. viridis</h1>
<p>Ananas sativus var. viridis, commonly known as the green pineapple, is a variant of the pineapple plant characterized by its distinct green foliage and smaller, less spiky leaves compared to the typical pineapple.</p>
<p>It is native to South America and is cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its fruit. The plant has a rosette growth pattern, with leaves that are broad and fleshy, forming a compact structure. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>While not commonly consumed for its fruit, it is sometimes used in landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
