                <h1>Acrostichum viscosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum viscosum, commonly known as the slippery fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its long, narrow, and often sticky fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to two meters.</p>
<p>The sticky surface of the fronds is a distinctive feature that helps in trapping small insects and debris.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum viscosum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically broad and dark green, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and somewhat fibrous, with a rough, bark-like texture and a pale greenish-brown color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are yellowish-green in color and bloom during the summer months, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds through wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum viscosum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, swamps, and along riverbanks where it thrives in moist, humid environments. This fern is also present in parts of the Caribbean and the southeastern United States. It prefers nutrient-rich soils and is often associated with disturbed or flooded habitats.</p>
<p>Its wide distribution reflects its adaptability to a variety of aquatic and semi-aquatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum viscosum was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, wetlands, and along waterways where it can thrive in moist conditions. This plant has adapted well to various soil types and can spread rapidly, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its introduction has led to competition with native plants, altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to control its spread and protect biodiversity.</p>
