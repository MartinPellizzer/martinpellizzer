                <h1>Actinodaphne obtusa</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. Its leaves and bark contain essential oils, which are used in traditional medicine and for aromatic purposes.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne obtusa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological importance in tropical forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne obtusa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a compact habit. The flowers are small, greenish-white, clustered in panicles, and bloom from September to November, likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns from green to yellowish when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne obtusa is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in lowland and montane areas. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soils. It is commonly encountered in the understory of primary forests.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne obtusa was mainly introduced to the Greater Antilles, particularly the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland tropical moist forests and disturbed areas. The plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to its establishment in secondary successional habitats across these regions.</p>
