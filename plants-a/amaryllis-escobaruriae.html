<p>Amaryllis escobaruriae, commonly known as the Escobar's amaryllis, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It features striking, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces large, fleshy leaves that are typically broad and strap-like, adapting to its high-altitude environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
