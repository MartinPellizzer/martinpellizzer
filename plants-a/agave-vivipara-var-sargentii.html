                    <h1>Agave vivipara var. sargentii</h1>
<p>Agave vivipara var. sargentii, commonly known as the Sargent's century plant, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. This plant is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often lined with sharp spines. One of its most notable features is its ability to produce offsets, or "pups," which allow it to propagate vegetatively.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, white to pale yellow flowers, which appear only once in its lifetime.</p>
