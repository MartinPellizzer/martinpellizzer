<p>Asplenium furcatum, commonly known as the forked spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, moist environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into segments, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium furcatum is characterized by its distinctive forked shape in the young fronds, which becomes less pronounced as the plant matures.</p>
