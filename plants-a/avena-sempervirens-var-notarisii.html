<p>Avena sempervirens var. notarisii, commonly known as the Notarisii oatgrass, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
