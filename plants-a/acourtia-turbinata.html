                <h1>Acourtia turbinata</h1>
<p>Acourtia turbinata, commonly known as the Turbinated Acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a flat-topped cluster, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia turbinata has small, hairy, ovate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a pale green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that is smooth when young and becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils it inhabits.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia turbinata is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Southeast, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky soils and open habitats, often growing along slopes and in disturbed areas. The distribution of Acourtia turbinata reflects its adaptability to the diverse ecological conditions of central and southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia turbinata was mainly introduced to areas with sandy soils and coastal environments, particularly in the western United States.</p>
<p>It has been observed spreading along dunes and disturbed sites, often outcompeting native vegetation. This plant is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas. Its introduction has led to concerns about ecological impact and habitat alteration.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native plant communities.</p>
