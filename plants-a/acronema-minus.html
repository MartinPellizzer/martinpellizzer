                <h1>Acronema minus</h1>
<p>Acronema minus, commonly known as the lesser acronema, is a small herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in dense inflorescences, usually greenish or white in color.</p>
<p>Acronema minus is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronema minus has small, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically light green on top and pale underneath, with a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly rough bark that is brown in color, and it grows in a creeping or ascending manner. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema minus is primarily native to China South-Central, East Himalaya, and Tibet.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in mountainous regions within these areas. It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with rocky or forested habitats. The species is well adapted to the high-altitude environments of these regions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its preference for cooler, moist conditions typical of these geographic locations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema minus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments where it can thrive in partial shade. The plant's ability to spread via wind-dispersed seeds contributes to its establishment in non-native areas. It is often seen in gardens and along roadsides in regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, Acronema minus has become a common sight in many introduced ecosystems.</p>
