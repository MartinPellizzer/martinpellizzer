<p>The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with prominent red veins that become more visible in autumn. It is a deciduous tree or shrub native to eastern North America, often found in moist, shady woodlands. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that aid in its dispersal.</p>
