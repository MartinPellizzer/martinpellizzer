<p>Acridocarpus smeathmannii, commonly known as the Ceylon ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries.

<p>Due to its ornamental and economic value, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and for timber production.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus smeathmannii has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by insects.
