<p>Axiniphyllum durangense, commonly known as the Durango fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Durango, Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Axiniphyllum durangense is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
