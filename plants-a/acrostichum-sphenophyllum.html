                <h1>Acrostichum sphenophyllum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum sphenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum sphenophyllum has large, elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a dense, overlapping manner along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows in a clumping pattern. This plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, with a greenish-white color, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in moist, swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum sphenophyllum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and estuarine areas. This plant is well adapted to brackish water conditions and often grows in association with other salt-tolerant species. Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of tidal flats and shallow water habitats.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum sphenophyllum was mainly introduced to areas with wet, tropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and abundant rainfall.</p>
<p>It thrives in swampy or seasonally flooded habitats, often found near rivers, lakes, and coastal areas. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed or nutrient-rich soils, making it a pioneer species in wetland ecosystems. Its introduction has been documented in several parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>However, its presence in non-native regions may have ecological implications due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
