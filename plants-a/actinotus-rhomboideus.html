                <h1>Actinotus rhomboideus</h1>
<p>Actinotus rhomboideus, commonly known as the diamond flower, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, white or pale pink flowers that are arranged in dense, spherical clusters, giving it a unique and striking appearance. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This plant is particularly valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its charming, dainty blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinotus rhomboideus has alternate, elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically 3â€“6 cm long, with a waxy, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, herbaceous, and often branched, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly fibrous with age. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, clustered in umbels, and bloom from late winter to early spring, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the moist, shaded environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus rhomboideus is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in areas with sandy soils. This plant thrives in coastal and heathland environments. It is often seen growing in open, sunny habitats along the coastline.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the unique flora of the South-Western Australian floral province.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus rhomboideus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the ornamental plant trade. The plant thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It has since become naturalized in parts of the country, particularly in the North Island.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and is generally confined to its introduced range.</p>
