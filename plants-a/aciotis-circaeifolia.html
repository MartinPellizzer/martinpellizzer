                <h1>Aciotis circaeifolia</h1>
<p>Aciotis circaeifolia, commonly known as the woolly goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions.</p>
<p>Aciotis circaeifolia is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis circaeifolia has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, slightly woody texture and a pale green to brownish color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in loose inflorescences, with tubular corollas that are typically yellow or orange, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis circaeifolia is primarily native to Brazil North, Colombia, French Guiana, and Guyana.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in dense forests or along riverbanks. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic areas.</p>
<p>The plant is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis circaeifolia was mainly introduced to control invasive weeds in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It is commonly used as a cover crop to suppress weed growth and improve soil structure. The plant is native to South America but has been introduced to various regions for its ecological benefits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often planted in rotation with other crops.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native areas.</p>
