<p>Allium vineale subsp.</p>
<p>purpureum, commonly known as purple garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers in the summer.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its bulbs, which are smaller than those of common garlic, are edible but have a milder flavor.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to other allium species and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>
