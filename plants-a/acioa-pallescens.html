                <h1>Acioa pallescens</h1>
<p>Acioa pallescens, commonly known as the pale acioa, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Acioa pallescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acioa pallescens has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a pale green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly woody, with a light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a sprawling or creeping pattern. Its small, white flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, with four petals and stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for absorbing moisture from the soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa pallescens is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies in these regions. This plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often associated with swamps and pine flatwood habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where the climate and soil type support its growth.</p>
<p>Acioa pallescens plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa pallescens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America. Its introduction has led to its spread in some parts of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in certain areas.</p>
