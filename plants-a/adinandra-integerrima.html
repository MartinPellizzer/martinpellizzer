                <h1>Adinandra integerrima</h1>
<p>Adinandra integerrima, commonly known as the blackwood tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The plant is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which gives it its common name, and its dense, evergreen foliage. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries.</p>
<p>Adinandra integerrima is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra integerrima has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small white flowers are clustered in axillary inflorescences, bloom during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, round drupe that splits open to release smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensively branched, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra integerrima is primarily native to Cambodia, China South-Central, Laos, Malaya, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It typically grows in lowland forests and secondary vegetation. The species is well adapted to the warm and humid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in the ecosystems where it is found.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra integerrima was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded understorey conditions. The plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities such as landscaping and reforestation efforts.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most of its introduced range.</p>
