<p>Adinandra integerrima, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, dark bark. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by black, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for various bird species. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>Adinandra integerrima is also noted for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity and soil stability.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra integerrima has simple, opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release smooth, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra integerrima is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes tropical rainforests and lowland areas, though its range has been reduced due to habitat loss. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall, typically found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Adinandra integerrima is usually found at altitudes between 0 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is listed as a vulnerable species due to deforestation and habitat degradation, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adinandra integerrima is a tropical evergreen tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with seeds requiring a period of cold stratification for optimal germination. The tree has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in warm, humid environments.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should be avoided from waterlogging. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the canopy are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants can enhance its growth and soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adinandra integerrima is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the pollination of other plants in the ecosystem. The plant also acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing coastal and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Adinandra integerrima plays a role in maintaining biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its environment.</p>
