                <h1>Achyronia lepida</h1>
<p>Achyronia lepida, commonly known as the slender achyronia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Achyronia lepida is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia lepida has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green, with tubular corollas and five lobes, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia lepida is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils along the coastlines and in maritime dunes. This plant is commonly found in coastal hammocks and scrub habitats. It is adapted to tolerate salt spray and frequent wind exposure.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia lepida was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas into natural habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
