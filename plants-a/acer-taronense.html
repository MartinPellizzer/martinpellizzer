<p>Acer taronense, commonly known as the Taronese maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree.</p>
