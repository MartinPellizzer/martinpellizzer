                <h1>Achyranthes tomentella</h1>
<p>Achyranthes tomentella, commonly known as hairy senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its fruits are capsules that contain several seeds, and the plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Achyranthes tomentella is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for various ailments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes tomentella has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 3–6 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes woolly underside. The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals and stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means, and the roots are fibrous, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes tomentella is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Thailand, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open woodlands, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands and has been introduced to other tropical regions.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across parts of Africa and the Middle East as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes tomentella was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, often thriving in areas with moderate to high moisture. The plant's ability to spread via seeds and vegetative propagation contributes to its establishment in non-native regions. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to other more aggressive invasive plants.</p>
