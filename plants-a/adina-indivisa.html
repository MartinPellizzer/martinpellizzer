                <h1>Adina indivisa</h1>
<p>Adina indivisa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed adina, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many flowering plants. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often elliptical or lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits.</p>
<p>Adina indivisa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina indivisa has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture and a slightly wavy margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and typically have a pinkish-white color, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina indivisa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with secondary growth forests. It is also known to occur in parts of India and the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the Indo-Malayan region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina indivisa was mainly introduced to urban and suburban areas in southern California for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found along roadsides, in vacant lots, and in gardens where it spreads readily through its prolific seed production. The plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid colonization of open spaces. It prefers full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, its spread can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems.</p>
