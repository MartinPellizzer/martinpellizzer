                        <h1>Acacia bidentata f. australis</h1>
<p>Acacia bidentata f. australis, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished from other acacia species by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia bidentata f. australis is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. This subspecies thrives in coastal and mountainous regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is commonly found in fynbos vegetation, which is characteristic of the region.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the dry summers and wet winters typical of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia bidentata f. australis was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in rehabilitation projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid conditions. This plant is also valued for its potential in providing forage for livestock in semi-arid regions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited to areas with low rainfall and poor soil quality.</p>
