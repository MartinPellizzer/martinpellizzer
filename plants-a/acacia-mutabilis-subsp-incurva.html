                <h1>Acacia mutabilis subsp. incurva</h1>
<p>Acacia mutabilis subsp.</p>
<p>incurva, commonly known as the variable wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow to golden-yellow flowers that appear in late winter to early spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>The species is known for its variable appearance, which gives it its common name.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia mutabilis subsp.</p>
<p>incurva has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>Its yellow flowers are clustered in globular inflorescences, blooming during the winter months, and are pollinated by birds and insects. The fruit is a flattened pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to access water in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia mutabilis subsp.</p>
<p>incurva is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa and Namibia. Its current distribution includes parts of southern Africa, where it has been introduced in some areas outside its native range.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland regions. This species typically grows at altitudes between 0 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered to be of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia mutabilis subsp.</p>
<p>incurva is a fast-growing, drought-tolerant shrub native to South America, prized for its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings showing higher success rates when rooted in a sandy, well-draining mix.</p>
<p>The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few years, making it ideal for quick landscaping. It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, preferring full sun to partial shade, and benefits from a light application of balanced fertilizer in spring. Pruning is recommended to maintain shape and encourage flowering, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with legumes or grasses can enhance soil fertility and provide natural pest control.</p>
