                    <h1>Asplenium riswanii</h1>
<p>Asplenium riswanii, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in rocky and shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium riswanii is often found in crevices of limestone or basalt rocks, where it forms dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its ability to colonize such harsh habitats makes it an important component of rock-associated ecosystems.</p>
