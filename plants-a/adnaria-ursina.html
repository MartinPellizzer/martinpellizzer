                <h1>Adnaria ursina</h1>
<p>Adnaria ursina, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, adapting well to saline environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are blue or violet in color.</p>
<p>Adnaria ursina is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria ursina has leaves that are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; they are typically 3-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria ursina is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas and rocky shores, often found in shallow waters. This plant is commonly associated with marine environments, particularly in areas with moderate temperatures and saline conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the temperate and subtropical zones of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria ursina was mainly introduced to coastal and brackish water environments in the Mediterranean and parts of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters where it can form dense mats on the seabed. This plant has been reported in several countries including Spain, Italy, and France, where it has established itself in estuaries and lagoons. Its introduction is believed to be due to ballast water discharge from ships.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to limited long-term data.</p>
