                <h1>Acourtia oxylepis</h1>
<p>Acourtia oxylepis, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. Acourtia oxylepis is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various insects and wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia oxylepis has small, narrow leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanging throughout the plant's life. Its flowers are small and clustered, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia oxylepis is primarily native to Mexico Northeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the northeastern regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Nuevo Le√≥n, Tamaulipas, and parts of Coahuila. This plant typically grows in rocky and limestone soils in arid and semi-arid environments. It is adapted to the dry climate and sparse vegetation of these regions.</p>
<p>Acourtia oxylepis is a small, flowering plant that plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia oxylepis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, particularly in the western United States.</p>
<p>It is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and along roadsides where human activity has altered the landscape. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Its introduction has led to its establishment in regions where it can outcompete native species.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardiness.</p>
