<p>Arenaria tetraquetra subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sandparsley, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, soft, white to grayish pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a woolly appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Its foliage is typically narrow and linear, with a bluish-green color that helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
