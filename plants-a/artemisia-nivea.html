                    <h1>Artemisia nivea</h1>
<p>Artemisia nivea, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its aromatic leaves emit a strong, camphor-like scent. Artemisia nivea thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>
