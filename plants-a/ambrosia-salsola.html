                    <h1>Ambrosia salsola</h1>
<p>Ambrosia salsola, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual plant native to the Eurasian steppes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments and thrives in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in new regions.</p>
<p>Ambrosia salsola has a shallow root system and is often found in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
