                    <h1>Agrostis tenuis var. stolonifera</h1>
<p>Agrostis tenuis var. stolonifera, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Its stoloniferous growth pattern enables it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent and resilient plant in suitable environments.</p>
