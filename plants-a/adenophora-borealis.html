                <h1>Adenophora borealis</h1>
<p>Adenophora borealis, commonly known as the northern bellflower, is a perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant is adapted to cold climates and grows in rocky or sandy soils. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer, and it is often found in tundra and subarctic environments.</p>
<p>Adenophora borealis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora borealis has elliptic to ovate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dull green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, somewhat hairy, and have a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and are typically pale blue to purple, blooming in late summer and early autumn, pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in its Arctic or alpine habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora borealis is primarily native to China North-Central and Inner Mongolia.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Adenophora borealis is often associated with alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora borealis was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has been found in regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has spread successfully in some areas where it competes with native flora.</p>
