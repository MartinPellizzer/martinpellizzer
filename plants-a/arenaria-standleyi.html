                    <h1>Arenaria standleyi</h1>
<p>Arenaria standleyi, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, adapted to thrive in sandy and rocky soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh desert conditions.</p>
