<p>Acacia adhaerens var. parviceps, commonly known as the dwarf acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, slender stems and dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the dry season. The plant has small, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Acacia adhaerens var. parviceps plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
