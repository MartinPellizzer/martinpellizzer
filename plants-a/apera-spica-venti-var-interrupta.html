<p>Apera spica-venti var. interrupta, commonly known as windgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and rapid growth, it is considered a common weed in agricultural and horticultural settings.</p>
