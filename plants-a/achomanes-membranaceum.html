                <h1>Achomanes membranaceum</h1>
<p>Achomanes membranaceum, commonly known as the paperleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, membranous leaves and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and blooms.</p>
<p>However, it is not commonly found in cultivation outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achomanes membranaceum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. The plant produces small, white flowers with four petals, blooming in spring and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule containing tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achomanes membranaceum is primarily native to the western United States, specifically in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shady areas such as woodlands and along stream banks. This plant thrives in regions with cool, humid climates and well-drained soils. It is often associated with mixed coniferous forests and is a characteristic species of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific ecological zones, where it plays a role in local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achomanes membranaceum was mainly introduced to North America through human activities such as horticulture and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, moist conditions. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded significantly in the eastern United States, particularly in states like Virginia and Maryland.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage.</p>
