                <h1>Achillea linearis</h1>
<p>Achillea linearis, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems and finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea linearis has narrow, linear leaves that are typically 10–20 cm long and 1–2 mm wide, with a gray-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and cylindrical, with a pale green to reddish-brown color, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite heads with a flat, disc-like structure, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish itself in various soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea linearis is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in countries such as Spain, Portugal, and Italy.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that includes parts of southern Europe and has been introduced to other regions, though it is not widely naturalized outside its native range. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils on slopes and in meadows. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted native habitat and limited spread, Achillea linearis is considered to be of conservation concern in some areas, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea linearis is a hardy perennial known for its feathery foliage and delicate yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, becoming active in spring and flowering in mid to late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune spent flowers to encourage rebloom.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs, and it pairs well with lavender and yarrow in companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea linearis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering shelter and habitat within its dense growth. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of nearby flora by improving soil conditions. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea linearis contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and promoting a healthy ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea linearis is a perennial plant known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat wounds and inflammation due to its anti-inflammatory and astringent qualities.</p>
