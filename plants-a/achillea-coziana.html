                <h1>Achillea coziana</h1>
<p>Achillea coziana, commonly known as the Cossean yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant features finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically white to pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Achillea coziana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in gardens for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea coziana has basal, broadly lanceolate to ovate leaves that are gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture and a waxy coating, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing from the base of the plant. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in flat-topped umbels, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea coziana is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region, specifically found in countries such as Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southern Europe and has been introduced to some areas outside its native range. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in steppe and shrubland environments. This species typically grows at elevations between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea coziana is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea coziana is a flowering plant known for its vibrant yellow blooms and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division or seed, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining the plant's genetic traits. The growth cycle of Achillea coziana typically involves a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea coziana is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, which contribute to the overall biodiversity of the ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other wildflowers to enhance soil health and promote a thriving garden environment. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it an effective plant for stabilizing slopes and degraded lands.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea coziana offers aesthetic value and can improve the ecological balance of natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea coziana is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, known for its delicate white and pink flowers.</p>
<p>It has limited culinary use due to its mild flavor, often used as a decorative element in salads or herbal teas.
