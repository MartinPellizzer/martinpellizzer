                    <h1>Asplenium ruta-muraria var. heterophyllum</h1>
<p>Asplenium ruta-muraria var. heterophyllum, commonly known as the wall rue, is a fern species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky walls or in woodland areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its variability in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its classification as a variant of the broader A. ruta-muraria species.</p>
