                <h1>Acalypha integrifolia subsp. marginata</h1>
<p>Acalypha integrifolia subsp.</p>
<p>marginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or margined hollyhock, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, giving it a velvety texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha integrifolia subsp.</p>
<p>marginata has elongated, ovate leaves that are smooth on the upper surface and hairy on the lower surface, with a wavy margin and a bright green color. The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, slightly hairy, and has a pale green to reddish-brown bark.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with stamen and pistil structures, blooming from late spring to early summer, and is primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed蒴果 that splits open to release three small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha integrifolia subsp.</p>
<p>marginata is a shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of Oceania and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in lowland forests. This species typically grows at altitudes between 0 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>It is currently listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though its introduction to new areas may pose ecological risks.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha integrifolia subsp.</p>
<p>marginata is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth habits. It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seed, with cuttings being the most reliable and commonly used method. This species has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent moisture, though it should not be overwatered. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering plants can enhance its ornamental value and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>
