<p>Asplenium assimile, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small evergreen fern native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on limestone or other calcareous substrates. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Asplenium assimile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas.</p>
