                <h1>Aechmea gustavoi</h1>
<p>Aechmea gustavoi, commonly known as the Gustavo's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, often with a striking contrast against the foliage. Its unique structure allows it to collect and store water in the central rosette, adapting to its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Aechmea gustavoi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in indoor environments with proper care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea gustavoi has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, stiff, and often have a waxy texture, arranged in a tight spiral at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green with a bluish tinge and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant has a short, underground stem with a fibrous, light-colored root system that helps anchor it in the soil. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, with small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the rainy season and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
