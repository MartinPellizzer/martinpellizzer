                    <h1>Aechmea gustavoi</h1>
<p>Aechmea gustavoi, commonly known as the Gustavo's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, often with a striking contrast against the foliage. Its unique structure allows it to collect and store water in the central rosette, adapting to its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Aechmea gustavoi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in indoor environments with proper care.</p>
