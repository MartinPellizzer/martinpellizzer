                <h1>Achmandra velutina</h1>
<p>Achmandra velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it can become a problematic weed in many regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achmandra velutina has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a pale green color, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achmandra velutina is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically from North Carolina to Florida.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, open habitats such as woodlands, glades, and along stream banks. This species thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often associated with disturbed or transitional areas. It is also present in parts of Georgia and South Carolina.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achmandra velutina was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. It has been reported in several countries in South America and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
