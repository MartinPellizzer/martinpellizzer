                <h1>Achillea beckiana</h1>
<p>Achillea beckiana, commonly known as Beck's yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. It is a perennial herb that thrives in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea beckiana has basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture and a slightly hairy surface, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with a rough, grayish bark, growing from the base of the plant. Its flowers are flat-topped clusters (compound umbels) of white to pale yellow petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea beckiana is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern California and northern Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is currently found primarily in its native range, though it may be cultivated in other areas. This species thrives in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and cliffs, often in full sun. It typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea beckiana is listed as endangered or critically endangered in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea beckiana is a low-maintenance, drought-tolerant perennial known for its vibrant yellow flowers and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seeds sown in late summer, ensuring new growth in the following season. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and entering dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, though it benefits from occasional deep watering during dry periods. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth.
