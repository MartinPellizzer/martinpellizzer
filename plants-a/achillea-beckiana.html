                <h1>Achillea beckiana</h1>
<p>Achillea beckiana, commonly known as Beck's yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. Its leaves are finely dissected and aromatic, while its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters.</p>
<p>Beck's yarrow is often used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea beckiana has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a silver-gray color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, slightly hairy, and have a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of white ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea beckiana is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is currently found in limited areas within its native range, primarily in the Mojave and Great Basin deserts. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. It is typically found at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea beckiana is listed as a species of concern in some regions, indicating a need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea beckiana is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant, daisy-like flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a summer growth cycle, blooming from late spring to early fall, with a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
