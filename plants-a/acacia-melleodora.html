                    <h1>Acacia melleodora</h1>
<p>Acacia melleodora, commonly known as the honeywood tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces small yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods. Acacia melleodora is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates.</p>
<p>Its name derives from the sweet, honey-scented fragrance of its flowers, which attracts various pollinators.</p>
