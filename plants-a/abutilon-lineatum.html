Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their relatives, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malvales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants like cotton and hibiscus, known for their showy flowers and fruit types. Its family is Malvaceae, commonly known as the mallow family, which includes plants with five-petaled flowers and a variety of fruit types such as capsules.

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon lineatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-like flowers.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century by European settlers and horticulturists who admired its unique appearance. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the environment of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have contributed to its widespread establishment in non-native regions.</p>
