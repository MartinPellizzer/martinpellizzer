                <h1>Acrostichum sporadolepis</h1>
<p>Acrostichum sporadolepis, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum sporadolepis plays an important role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum sporadolepis has large, pinnately compound leaves that are elongated, dark green on top, and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is robust, with a rough, fibrous bark that is typically brown in color, and it grows in a creeping manner along the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, with yellowish-green petals, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. Its fruits are three-winged, dry berries that disperse via wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum sporadolepis is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland environments, often found in swampy or mangrove areas. This plant is commonly associated with coastal and brackish water habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife. Its distribution is largely restricted to the Indo-Malayan region, with limited occurrences in parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is not widely found outside of these native regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum sporadolepis was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and disturbed soils, often near human settlements.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions where there is consistent moisture and partial shade. This plant is commonly found in wetlands, along riverbanks, and in disturbed forest edges. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems remains under study due to limited long-term data.</p>
