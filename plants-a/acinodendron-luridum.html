                <h1>Acinodendron luridum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron luridum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered acinodendron, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are typically opposite and ovate in shape. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron luridum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a dense, upright habit. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release three winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taprooted, anchoring the plant in nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron luridum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland rainforests where it grows as an understory plant. This species is commonly found in areas with rich, well-drained soils and high rainfall. Its natural habitat includes secondary forests and disturbed sites within these regions.</p>
<p>Acinodendron luridum plays a role in the local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various fauna.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron luridum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa and Namibia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is often found along the shoreline. This plant has been documented in several protected areas and is considered an invasive species in some regions. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental dispersal via maritime transport.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation, it poses a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
