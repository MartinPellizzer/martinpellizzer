<p>It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically divided into several pairs of leaflets, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and steppe ecosystems.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
