<p>Astelma retorta, commonly known as the twisted astelma, is a unique plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiral-shaped stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down.</p>
<p>Astelma retorta is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its striking appearance.</p>
