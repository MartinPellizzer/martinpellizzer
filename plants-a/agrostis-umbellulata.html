                    <h1>Agrostis umbellulata</h1>
<p>Agrostis umbellulata, commonly known as the woolly bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
