                <h1>Adenanthos glabrescens</h1>
<p>Adenanthos glabrescens, commonly known as the silky adenanthos, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its flowers typically bloom from late autumn to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Adenanthos glabrescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos glabrescens has leaves that are narrow and linear, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in dense clumps. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with yellow petals and a distinctive hooded structure, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos glabrescens is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the areas around the Fitzgerald River National Park and the south-western coastal regions. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal heathlands and dunes. It is well adapted to the dry, temperate climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adenanthos glabrescens is an important component of the local flora and is often seen in conservation areas and botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos glabrescens was mainly introduced to South Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. It has been reported in several regions across the state, including the Lower South-east.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these areas.</p>
