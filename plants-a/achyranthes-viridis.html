                <h1>Achyranthes viridis</h1>
<p>Achyranthes viridis, commonly known as prostrate chaffflower, is a low-growing, annual herb native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, sprawling stems that often lie close to the ground, producing small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its root system is fibrous and extensive. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become a weed in cultivated areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes viridis has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually 3-8 cm long and 1-3 cm wide, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, slightly hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals, blooming from July to September, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged schizocarp that splits into three one-seeded units, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help the plant anchor in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes viridis is primarily native to Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in various habitats across the country, including grasslands, woodlands, and disturbed areas. The plant thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and is often seen growing along roadsides and in agricultural fields. It is a hardy species that adapts well to different soil types.</p>
<p>Its native range in Tanzania reflects its ecological versatility and importance in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes viridis was mainly introduced to areas where it has become an invasive species, often outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in moist to wet environments. The plant spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by water, wind, and animals. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it a significant ecological concern in many regions.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread include mechanical removal and the use of herbicides.</p>
