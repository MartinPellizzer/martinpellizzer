                    <h1>Achyranthes viridis</h1>
<p>Achyranthes viridis, commonly known as prostrate chaffflower, is a low-growing, annual herb native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, sprawling stems that often lie close to the ground, producing small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its root system is fibrous and extensive. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become a weed in cultivated areas.</p>
