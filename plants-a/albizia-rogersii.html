                    <h1>Albizia rogersii</h1>
<p>Albizia rogersii, commonly known as the silk tree or false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that are pinnately arranged and often have a silvery underside. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in racemes. Albizia rogersii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy blooms, though it is not typically grown for its fruit or timber.</p>
