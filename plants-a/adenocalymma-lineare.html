                <h1>Adenocalymma lineare</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma lineare, commonly known as the linear adenocalymma, is a flowering plant species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland regions. It produces flowers in shades of pink or white, which attract various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma lineare has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma lineare is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of the state of Esp√≠rito Santo. The plant thrives in sandy soils along the Atlantic coast. It is commonly found in areas with a humid subtropical climate.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma lineare is an important component of the local flora in this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma lineare was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southeastern region, as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant is known for its low maintenance requirements and ability to tolerate drought conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several states, although it is not considered invasive in most regions.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts.</p>
