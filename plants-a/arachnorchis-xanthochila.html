                    <h1>Arachnorchis xanthochila</h1>
<p>Arachnorchis xanthochila, commonly known as the golden spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the subtropical regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with elongated, thread-like leaves and a single, showy, yellow-brown flower spike. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rainforests or under dense vegetation. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often protected in conservation programs.</p>
