<p>It is a compact, herbaceous perennial with finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, pale pink to rose-colored flowers. The plant produces numerous showy florets that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and extended blooming period.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. roseoides has leaves that are finely divided, feathery, and pinnately arranged, with a bright green color and a moderate size, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, herbaceous, and have a smooth texture, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of small white petals surrounding yellow central disk florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a dry, achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in various soil types.</p>
