<p>Androsace friesii, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine habitats.</p>
