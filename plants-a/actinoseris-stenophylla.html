                <h1>Actinoseris stenophylla</h1>
<p>Actinoseris stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and other composite flowers. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves and produces yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand drought and intense sunlight, making it a hardy species in harsh climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinoseris stenophylla has leaves that are narrow, linear, and arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, covered with a rough, greyish bark, and grows upright from the base. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in umbels, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoseris stenophylla is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils along the Pacific coast. This species thrives in areas with high salt exposure and strong coastal winds. It is often seen in habitats near the ocean, where it forms part of the dune vegetation.</p>
<p>Actinoseris stenophylla plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoseris stenophylla was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It was introduced as a ornamental plant due to its attractive, spiny foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its spread has been facilitated by its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its rapid reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its spread and protect native plant communities.</p>
