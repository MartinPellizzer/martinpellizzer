<p>Asclepias vestita subsp.</p>
<p>vestita, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy stems and leaves covered in fine white hairs, which give it a distinctive, woolly appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its milkweed sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many herbivores but serve as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>This subspecies is particularly important as a host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species.</p>
