<p>Aleuritopteris schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Aleuritopteris schaffneri plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
