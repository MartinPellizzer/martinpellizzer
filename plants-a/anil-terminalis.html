                    <h1>Anil terminalis</h1>
<p>Anil terminalis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing small, flat seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Anil terminalis is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
