                <h1>Adicea franquevilleana</h1>
<p>Adicea franquevilleana, commonly known as the Franqueville's adicea, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a wide variety of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that often have four petals. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea franquevilleana has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom during the dry season; they are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the surface soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea franquevilleana is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador, where the climate is warm and humid. This plant thrives in shaded undergrowth, often growing in association with other understory species. Its natural range is limited to specific regions within the Neotropical area.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, its distribution has become increasingly restricted in recent years.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea franquevilleana was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of South America. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land clearing and urban expansion.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
