<p>Agrostis vulgaris f. contracta, commonly known as the compact meadowgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass that forms dense, mat-like growth, often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and more compact than those of the typical form. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in shaded or partially shaded conditions.</p>
<p>This form is often used in ornamental gardening for its fine texture and ability to create a lush, carpet-like appearance.</p>
