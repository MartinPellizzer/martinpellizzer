                        <h1>Acer amamiense</h1>
<p>Acer amamiense, commonly known as the Amami maple, is a species of maple native to the Amami Islands of Japan.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters. The plant features palmate leaves with five lobes, which are bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while the fruits are samaras with a winged structure that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The Amami maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acer amamiense belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their primitive features. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with a wide range of floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Sapindales, which consists of flowering plants that often have compound leaves and fruits that are either capsules or drupes. Its family is Sapindaceae, commonly known as the soapberry family, which includes trees and shrubs with often showy flowers and diverse fruit types. Its genus is Acer, which refers to the maple trees, known for their distinctive palmate leaves and colorful autumn foliage.</p>
<p>Its species is Acer amamiense, a rare maple species native to Japan, characterized by its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer amamiense is primarily native to the Nansei-shoto archipelago.</p>
<p>This region includes the Amami Islands, Okinawa, and surrounding islands in southern Japan. The plant is found in subtropical and tropical moist lowland forests. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in this area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer amamiense was mainly introduced to Japan, where it has been found growing in the Amami Islands.</p>
<p>This species is native to Southeast Asia and was likely introduced as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf structure and aesthetic appeal. It has adapted well to the local climate and soil conditions in Japan. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, further study is needed to assess its ecological effects.</p>
