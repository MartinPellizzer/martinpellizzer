                    <h1>Archangelica officinalis</h1>
<p>Archangelica officinalis, commonly known as hogweed, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves and tall, branched stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are pollinated by insects. Its roots and leaves contain toxic compounds, including furanocoumarins, which can cause phototoxic reactions upon skin contact.</p>
<p>Despite its harmful properties, it has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent.</p>
