                <h1>Acrolasia dispersa</h1>
<p>Acrolasia dispersa, commonly known as the spreading acrolasia, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular flowers that are typically pink or violet in color, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savannah habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolasia dispersa has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually green with a slightly pubescent underside, ranging in size from 2 to 6 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a creeping growth pattern, with bark that is thin, smooth, and light brown in color. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia dispersa is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests, often growing in shaded understory environments. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, making it a characteristic species of tropical rainforests. It is also occasionally reported in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific ecological conditions, its distribution is relatively limited to these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia dispersa was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as intentional planting for ornamental purposes or accidental transport via contaminated soil or equipment.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant's ability to thrive in disturbed environments contributes to its successful establishment in these areas. It spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind, water, and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is now considered a threat to local ecosystems in some regions.</p>
