                    <h1>Androsace septentrionalis var. subintegra</h1>
<p>Androsace septentrionalis var. subintegra, commonly known as the Northern Androsace, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of northern Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly larger and more integrated leaf structure compared to other varieties of Androsace septentrionalis.</p>
