<p>Aleuritopteris longifrons, commonly known as the long-fronded water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread across moist environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Aleuritopteris longifrons thrives in humid, shaded areas near water bodies, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
