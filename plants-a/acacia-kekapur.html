<p>Acacia kekapur, commonly known as the Kepapur acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical inflorescences, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Acacia kekapur is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia kekapur has leaves that are phyllodes, which are flattened and sword-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically a deep brown color, and it grows in a spreading shrub form. The flowers are clustered in spherical or cylindrical inflorescences, with yellow petals and a sweet fragrance, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody pod that splits open to release elongated, flattened seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and taproot-like, allowing the plant to access groundwater in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia kekapur is a rare shrub native to the island of Madagascar, specifically found in the eastern part of the country.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated regions within the humid rainforests of northeastern Madagascar. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in shaded, forested areas. It grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Acacia kekapur is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia kekapur is a hardy shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions, known for its resilience and ornamental value.</p>
