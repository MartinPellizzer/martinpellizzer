                        <h1>Acacia kekapur</h1>
<p>Acacia kekapur, commonly known as the black wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and compound leaves with multiple pairs of leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by woody pods containing seeds. Acacia kekapur is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in local ecosystems and has been used by Indigenous Australians for various purposes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia kekapur is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and Queensland. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with dry shrublands and open woodlands. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of water and the specific climatic conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia kekapur was mainly introduced to areas with poor soil conditions and arid climates due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia where it has been planted for soil stabilization and as a source of timber. The plant's introduction has sometimes led to the displacement of native vegetation, raising concerns about its ecological impact. Despite this, it is valued for its role in preventing soil erosion and providing fodder for livestock.</p>
<p>Its distribution continues to expand in regions where land degradation is a significant issue.</p>
