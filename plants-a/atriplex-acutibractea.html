                    <h1>Atriplex acutibractea</h1>
<p>Atriplex acutibractea, commonly known as the sharpbract saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it an important component of coastal and inland saltbush habitats.</p>
<p>Atriplex acutibractea plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range.</p>
