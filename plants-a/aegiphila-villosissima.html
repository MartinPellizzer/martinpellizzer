<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila villosissima has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a hairy surface and a dark green color.</p>
