<p>Acanthopanax divaricatus var. inermis, commonly known as the unarmed Chinese dogwood, is a shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by the absence of thorns on its stems, unlike its closely related species.</p>
