<p>Aira laxa, commonly known as the slender air grass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into pale brown or tan seeds.</p>
<p>Aira laxa is often used in native plant gardens due to its low maintenance and ecological value.</p>
