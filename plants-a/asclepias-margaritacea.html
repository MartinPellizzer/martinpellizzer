                    <h1>Asclepias margaritacea</h1>
<p>Asclepias margaritacea, commonly known as the white milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds attached to silky, parachute-like structures, aiding in wind dispersal. Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Asclepias margaritacea is also an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae.</p>
