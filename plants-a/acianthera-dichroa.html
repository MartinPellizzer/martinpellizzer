                <h1>Acianthera dichroa</h1>
<p>Acianthera dichroa, commonly known as the two-colored orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two-colored petals, typically featuring a combination of white and purple or pink hues. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Acianthera dichroa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera dichroa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a white or pale pink color, and have a tubular structure with three petals, blooming during the summer months and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera dichroa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and humid environments. This species thrives in shaded, moist areas with rich organic soil. It is often seen growing on tree trunks or among the undergrowth in dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Acianthera dichroa is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera dichroa was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly associated with forest edges, shrublands, and rocky outcrops. The plant thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and is often found in tropical and subtropical zones. Its introduction has been documented in several countries in South America, particularly in Brazil and Peru.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
