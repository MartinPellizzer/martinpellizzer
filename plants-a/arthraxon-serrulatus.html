<p>Arthraxon serrulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense clumps with grass-like leaves. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with serrated edges, which give it its scientific name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces three-sided, triangular seeds.</p>
<p>Arthraxon serrulatus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
