                    <h1>Anogramma ascensionis</h1>
<p>Anogramma ascensionis, commonly known as the Ascension fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Ascension in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in crevices within coastal areas. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying island endemism.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this vulnerable species from habitat loss and invasive species.</p>
