                    <h1>Aconitum volubile var. hirsutum</h1>
<p>Aconitum volubile var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy blue poppy, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant is a climbing species, often found in rocky or alpine environments, and it produces showy, spurred petals that attract pollinators. Its foliage is typically deeply lobed and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This variant is less common than the typical form of Aconitum volubile and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens.</p>
