<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha purpusii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly woody with age, and it grows upright with a somewhat branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from summer to fall, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed schizocarp that splits into three one-seeded segments, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha purpusii is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
