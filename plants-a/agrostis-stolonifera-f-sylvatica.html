                    <h1>Agrostis stolonifera f. sylvatica</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonifera f. sylvatica, commonly known as the forest bentgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass that thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a deep green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This form is a natural variant of Agrostis stolonifera, characterized by its ability to spread via stolons, forming dense, carpet-like growth. It is often found in woodland floors and along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of ecologically diverse habitats.</p>
