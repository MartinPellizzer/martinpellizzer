                <h1>Adenodolichos huillensis</h1>
<p>Adenodolichos huillensis, commonly known as the Huill√©n wild bean, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and potential for agricultural use.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos huillensis has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their small size and light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos huillensis is primarily native to Angola and Zambia.</p>
<p>This species is found in the southern regions of Angola, particularly in the Cuando Cubango Province. In Zambia, it occurs in the eastern part of the country, near the border with Angola. It typically grows in dry savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos huillensis was mainly introduced to regions with suitable climatic conditions, such as temperate and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats, including roadsides, fields, and forest edges. This plant has been reported in several countries in South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. Its introduction may be associated with human activities, such as agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has the potential to spread further if not managed properly.</p>
