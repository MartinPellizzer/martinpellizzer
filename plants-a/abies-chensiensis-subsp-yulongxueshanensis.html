<p>Abies chensiensis subsp.</p>
<p>yulongxueshanensis, commonly known as the Yulong Snow Mountain fir, is a rare and endemic conifer found in the high-altitude regions of Yulong Snow Mountain in Yunnan Province, China. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal tree form and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches.</p>
<p>The cones are typically small and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown color, and the tree produces a distinctive, aromatic resin. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, often growing in mixed forests at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies chensiensis subsp.</p>
<p>yulongxueshanensis is primarily native to the Yulong Snow Mountain region in Yunnan Province, China. This subspecies is found in the high-altitude areas of the mountain, typically at elevations between 3,000 and 4,500 meters.</p>
<p>It grows in cool, moist, and relatively sheltered habitats within the mountainous terrain. The plant is adapted to the harsh climate and limited soil conditions of its native environment.</p>
<p>Its distribution is restricted to this specific mountain range, making it a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies chensiensis subsp.</p>
<p>yulongxueshanensis was mainly introduced to the western region of China, particularly in the Yulong Snow Mountain area. This subspecies is native to the high-altitude forests of Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its conical shape and dark green needles. The distribution is limited to specific elevations, typically between 2,500 and 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>It plays a vital role in the local ecosystem and is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
