<p>Abies chensiensis subsp.</p>
<p>yulongxueshanensis, commonly known as the Yulong Snow Mountain fir, is a rare and endemic conifer found in the high-altitude regions of Yulong Snow Mountain in Yunnan Province, China. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal tree form and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches.</p>
<p>The cones are typically small and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown color, and the tree produces a distinctive, aromatic resin. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, often growing in mixed forests at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
