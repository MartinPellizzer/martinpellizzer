                <h1>Aconitum candollei</h1>
<p>Aconitum candollei, commonly known as the Himalayan monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in a tall spire. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a poisonous plant and requires caution when handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum candollei has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a serrated edge; they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is tall, straight, and smooth, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing upright with a single stem. Its flowers are blue to purple, clustered in dense racemes, with spurred petals and showy sepals, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and water.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum candollei is primarily native to the high altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas, including parts of Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This species is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and moderate temperatures. It is often associated with mountainous terrain at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and found only in limited geographic regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum candollei was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states like California, Oregon, and Washington.</p>
<p>It was originally native to the Andes Mountains in South America. The plant was introduced as an ornamental due to its striking blue or purple flowers. It has since naturalized in some areas, becoming invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora in local ecosystems.</p>
