                <h1>Achyranthes glauca</h1>
<p>Achyranthes glauca, commonly known as blue morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in the morning, giving it its common name. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its rapid growth and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes glauca has alternate, lanceolate leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long and 1-2 cm wide, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in spikes and bloom from late spring to early summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant, contributing to its ability to thrive in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes glauca is primarily native to parts of Africa, southern Asia, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as India, Pakistan, and parts of East Africa. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is known for its striking blue-green leaves.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends from the Arabian Peninsula to Southeast Asia, where it is often seen in grasslands and along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes glauca was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides, railroads, and waste areas. The plant has become naturalized in these regions, sometimes spreading into native habitats. Its introduction is believed to be accidental, likely through seed dispersal via human activity or contaminated agricultural products.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies in some areas, it is also used in traditional medicine and horticulture.</p>
