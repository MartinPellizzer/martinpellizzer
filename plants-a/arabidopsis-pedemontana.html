                    <h1>Arabidopsis pedemontana</h1>
<p>Arabidopsis pedemontana, commonly known as the Montane Arabidopsis, is a species of flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small annual herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions. The plant has simple, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic simplicity and short life cycle, it is sometimes used in botanical studies, though it is less commonly studied than Arabidopsis thaliana.</p>
