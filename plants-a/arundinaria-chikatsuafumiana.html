<p>Arundinaria chikatsuafumiana, commonly known as the Chikatsuafumiana bamboo, is a rare and ornamental grass species native to Japan.</p>

It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
