                <h1>Acer shirasawanum var. tenuifolium</h1>
<p>Acer shirasawanum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves that are often tinged with red or yellow during the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. It typically grows to a height of 5–10 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer shirasawanum var. tenuifolium has leaves that are narrowly elliptic to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a pale green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub with a spreading habit. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during late spring to early summer, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its preferred moist, shaded habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer shirasawanum var. tenuifolium is a rare variant of the Japanese maple native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Japan.</p>
<p>Its native range is primarily within the Kii Peninsula and parts of Kyushu. Currently, it is found in limited areas, mostly in shaded, moist forests with rich soil. It typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer shirasawanum var. tenuifolium is a rare and ornamental maple known for its delicate, slender leaves and vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This species has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in well-drained, acidic soil with consistent moisture.</p>
<p>Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal in shaded garden settings.</p>
