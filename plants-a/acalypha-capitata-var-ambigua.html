<p>Acalypha capitata var. ambigua, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with deep red veins contrasting against its dark green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha capitata var. ambigua is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. This variant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with forest understories or disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and some islands in the Pacific.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its showy, clustered inflorescences and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha capitata var. ambigua was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has established itself in coastal and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>This plant was likely introduced as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats across the island.
