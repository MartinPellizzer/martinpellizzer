                <h1>Achillea viscosa</h1>
<p>Achillea viscosa, commonly known as Sticky yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a creeping growth habit with wiry stems and basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs. Its aromatic foliage and ability to thrive in poor soil make it a common weed in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea viscosa has basal, aromatic leaves that are narrow, linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a grayish-green color due to fine pubescence.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, somewhat hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing in a clustered pattern from the base. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, which facilitates wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea viscosa is primarily native to southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as the Mediterranean basin, including countries like Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and southern France. This plant thrives in rocky soils and dry habitats, often growing in open woodlands and grasslands. Its distribution extends into parts of Turkey and the Middle East, where it adapts to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is also present in some areas of the Caucasus and central Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea viscosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. The plant has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats, including disturbed soils and roadside areas. It is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to spread readily.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently classified as a noxious weed in New Zealand.</p>
