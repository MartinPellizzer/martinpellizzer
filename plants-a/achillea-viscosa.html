                <h1>Achillea viscosa</h1>
<p>Achillea viscosa, commonly known as sticky yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters called cymes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for pollinators and a subject of interest in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea viscosa has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and covered in fine hairs, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, branched, and have a rough, grayish-brown bark. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from June to September and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind due to its feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant thrive in dry, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea viscosa is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>Its current distribution extends to parts of North Africa and the Canary Islands, where it thrives in dry, sunny environments. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in open habitats such as scrublands and coastal areas. This species is commonly found at altitudes ranging from sea level to around 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>It is considered to be of low conservation concern due to its widespread distribution and ability to adapt to various environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea viscosa is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and bright yellow flowers, commonly found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with the latter method offering faster establishment. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth in spring and flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, as it is drought-tolerant. Fertilization should be light, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and provide beneficial pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea viscosa is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, which contribute to the ecosystem's biodiversity. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea viscosa offers ecological benefits by supporting local fauna and contributing to the overall health of the environment.</p>
