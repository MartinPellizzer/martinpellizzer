                <h1>Adenia fernandesiana</h1>
<p>Adenia fernandesiana, commonly known as the Madagascar starwood, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its woody stem and compound leaves. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers with a distinctive star-shaped appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Adenia fernandesiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia fernandesiana has elliptical, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a leathery texture and a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a somewhat branched structure. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with yellowish-white petals and a strong, unpleasant odor, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by flies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and serve as storage organs, helping the plant survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia fernandesiana is primarily native to Burundi.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the southern and western parts. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats. It is part of the family Menispermaceae and is known for its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Burundi.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia fernandesiana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions like French Polynesia and the Society Islands.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The introduction has led to its establishment in coastal and disturbed habitats across these islands. Despite its beauty, it has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution highlights the impact of human activity on plant dispersal and ecological balance.</p>
