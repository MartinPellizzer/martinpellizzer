                <h1>Aconitum reflexum</h1>
<p>Aconitum reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, doubly serrated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It prefers moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments.</p>
<p>Aconitum reflexum is part of the Ranunculaceae family and contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum reflexum has leaves that are compound, pinnately arranged, with deeply lobed blades that are typically blue-green in color and can reach up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a greyish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in racemes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a slit, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum reflexum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky soils at high elevations. This plant is commonly found in the Pamir and Tien Shan mountain ranges, where the climate is cold and the terrain is rugged. It is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Aconitum reflexum is also occasionally reported in the western parts of China, particularly in the Xinjiang region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum reflexum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and stream sides. This plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It spreads through its rhizomes and seeds, making it difficult to control once established.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns among conservationists regarding its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
