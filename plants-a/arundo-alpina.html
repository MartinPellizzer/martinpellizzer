<p>Arundo alpina, commonly known as alpine reed, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, greenish flowers in panicles during the summer months.</p>
<p>Arundo alpina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
