<p>Atriplex nummularia subsp.</p>
<p>erosa, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, helping it to retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. Its leaves are typically rounded and succulent, adapted to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>It is often found in sandy soils and is used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
