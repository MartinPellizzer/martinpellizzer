<p>Aspidium producens, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium producens plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
