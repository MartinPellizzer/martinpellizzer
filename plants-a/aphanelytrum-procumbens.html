<p>Aphanelytrum procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its spreading, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a dense, mat-forming structure that helps it thrive in disturbed or arid soils.</p>
<p>Aphanelytrum procumbens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
