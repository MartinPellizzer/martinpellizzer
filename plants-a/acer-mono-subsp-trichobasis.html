<p>Acer mono subsp.</p>
<p>trichobasis, commonly known as the trichobasis maple, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its growth habit is usually shrub-like, with compact branching and a dense canopy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
