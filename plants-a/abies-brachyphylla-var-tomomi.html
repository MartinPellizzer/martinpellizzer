                        <h1>Abies brachyphylla var. tomomi</h1>
<p>Abies brachyphylla var. tomomi, commonly known as the Tomomi fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is a variant of the brachyphylla fir, characterized by its short, dense needles and compact growth habit. The tree typically grows in high-altitude regions, where it forms dense forests or isolated stands. Its cones are small and often remain attached to the branches for a long time, contributing to its unique ecological role.</p>
<p>The species is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential for genetic diversity.</p>
