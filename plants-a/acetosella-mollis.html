                <h1>Acetosella mollis</h1>
<p>Acetosella mollis, commonly known as lesser mouse-ear, is a small perennial herb belonging to the Primulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, rounded leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant typically grows to a height of 5â€“15 cm and has a mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>Its flowers bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acetosella mollis has small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stems are short and creeping, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that grows close to the ground. The flowers are tiny, clustered in umbels, and are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when disturbed.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in moist, acidic environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acetosella mollis is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees, Alps, and Carpathians.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to specific areas in southern and central Europe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Acetosella mollis is typically found at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is classified as a rare species and is considered threatened in several regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acetosella mollis is a low-growing, evergreen shrub known for its dense, moss-like foliage and compact form, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or division, with the best results achieved in early spring or late summer. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in cool climates and producing new growth throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, acidic soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of slow-release fertilizer in spring, while pruning is generally limited to shaping and removing dead or damaged branches. Acetosella mollis is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>It pairs well with alpines and other low-growing plants, making it an excellent companion for creating a cohesive garden design.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acetosella mollis is a low-growing plant that provides food and shelter for various small insects and wildlife.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, clustered flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other wildflowers to enhance biodiversity. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acetosella mollis contributes to soil health by acting as a nitrogen fixer through its association with symbiotic bacteria.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acetosella mollis is a small, low-growing plant commonly found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it can be foraged as a wild edible in some regions, offering a mild, slightly sour flavor. In traditional medicine, it has been used to treat skin conditions and as a diuretic due to its high tannin content. Industrially, it is not economically significant, but its presence in ecosystems contributes to soil stabilization and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is sometimes associated with folklore and has symbolic meanings in certain regional traditions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acetosella mollis has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Albiflora' and 'Rosea', which are known for their showy white and pink flowers respectively. Hybrids of Acetosella mollis are often created to enhance flower color and vigor, making them more suitable for garden settings. These plants are of horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in shaded areas and their attractive foliage.</p>
<p>They are commonly used in woodland gardens and as ground covers.</p>
