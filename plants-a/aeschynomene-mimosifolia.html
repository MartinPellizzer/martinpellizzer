<p>Aeschynomene mimosifolia, commonly known as the mimosa tree or silky mimosa, is a fast-growing shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold when touched, a trait known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers arranged in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often used in reforestation projects.</p>
<p>Aeschynomene mimosifolia is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, enhancing soil fertility.</p>
