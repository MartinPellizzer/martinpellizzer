                    <h1>Ammannia petrensis</h1>
<p>Ammannia petrensis, commonly known as the desert bluemouth, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ammannia petrensis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in extreme conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
