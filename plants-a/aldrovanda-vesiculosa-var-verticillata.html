                    <h1>Aldrovanda vesiculosa var. verticillata</h1>
<p>Aldrovanda vesiculosa var. verticillata, commonly known as the spiral waterwheel plant, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which are modified into snapping traps to capture small aquatic prey. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its rapid closing mechanism, triggered by touch, is one of the fastest in the plant kingdom.</p>
<p>The varietal form verticillata differs from the typical Aldrovanda vesiculosa by its more compact, spiral growth pattern.</p>
