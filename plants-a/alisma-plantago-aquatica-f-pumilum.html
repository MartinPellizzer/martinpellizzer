                    <h1>Alisma plantago-aquatica f. pumilum</h1>
<p>Alisma plantago-aquatica f. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted for aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, contributing to its ornamental value. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shallow water.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in marshes, pond edges, and slow-moving streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems.</p>
