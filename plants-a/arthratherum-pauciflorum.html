                    <h1>Arthratherum pauciflorum</h1>
<p>Arthratherum pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered arthratherum, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear a limited number of flowers, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Arthratherum pauciflorum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
