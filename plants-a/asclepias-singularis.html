<p>Asclepias singularis, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Asclepias singularis plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
