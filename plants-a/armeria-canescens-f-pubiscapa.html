                    <h1>Armeria canescens f. pubiscapa</h1>
<p>Armeria canescens f. pubiscapa, commonly known as the hairy sea thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are gray-green and covered in fine, soft hairs, which give the plant its "hairy" appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in maritime climates.</p>
