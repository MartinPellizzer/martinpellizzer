<p>Alchemilla alpestris f. autumnalis, commonly known as autumnal lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer to early autumn, which are clustered in dense, round inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and prolonged flowering period.</p>
