<p>Acacia spirorbis, commonly known as the spiral acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of branches, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, feather-like leaflets.</p>
<p>Acacia spirorbis is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a low-growing habit to reduce water loss.</p>
