                    <h1>Aeonium</h1>
<p>Aeonium, commonly known as the "Roman Candle" or "Tree Aeonium," is a genus of flowering plants in the Crassulaceae family.</p>
<p>These succulent plants are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves, which are often thick and fleshy to store water. Aeonium species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, southern Europe, and the Mediterranean. They produce striking inflorescences that resemble candles, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red.</p>
<p>Many aeoniums are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
