                    <h1>Asplenium × lucrosum</h1>
<p>Asplenium × lucrosum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. It reproduces vegetatively through spores rather than seeds, as it is not fertile.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation.</p>
