                    <h1>Agalinis fasciculata var. peninsularis</h1>
<p>Agalinis fasciculata var. peninsularis, commonly known as the Florida agalinis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a rare and endangered species, facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species.</p>
