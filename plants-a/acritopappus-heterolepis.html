                <h1>Acritopappus heterolepis</h1>
<p>Acritopappus heterolepis, commonly known as the roughleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually rough and hairy, with a grayish-green color, and it produces small, yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acritopappus heterolepis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, winged achene, dispersed by wind due to its light weight and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acritopappus heterolepis is primarily native to Brazil Northeast.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the northeastern region of Brazil, where it thrives in specific environmental conditions. It is commonly associated with tropical and subtropical habitats in this area. The species is adapted to the local climate and soil types of the region.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to this geographic area within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acritopappus heterolepis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban settings. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly, which contributes to its invasive potential. It has been reported in several regions across the United States, particularly in the Midwest and Southeast.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and competitive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems.</p>
