                <h1>Adiantum smithianum</h1>
<p>Adiantum smithianum, commonly known as the Smith's maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a graceful, arching appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Adiantum smithianum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum smithianum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are dark green and slightly glossy, arranged in a bipinnate pattern.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 30â€“50 cm long and are attached to the stem by a slender, wiry rachis. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching.</p>
<p>Adiantum smithianum is typically sterile and does not produce flowers. It produces spores rather than seeds, with spores dispersed by wind through the sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum smithianum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream banks. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often associated with limestone habitats. It is also present in parts of southern China and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum smithianum was mainly introduced to moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant is commonly found in temperate regions with rich, well-drained soil. It prefers partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>Its delicate fronds make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>
