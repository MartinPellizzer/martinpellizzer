<p>Artemisia lagopus subsp.</p>
<p>triniana, commonly known as the alpine tansy, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in dense, rounded shapes, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
