                    <h1>Aconitum volubile var. latisectum</h1>
<p>Aconitum volubile var. latisectum, commonly known as the broad-leafed monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are often broader than those of the typical Aconitum volubile. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland or garden settings.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to shady garden landscapes.</p>
