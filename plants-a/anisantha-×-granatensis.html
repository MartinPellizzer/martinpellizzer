<p>Anisantha × granatensis, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Anisantha mertensii and Anisantha pseudotulipiflora.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond edges. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique hybrid characteristics and ecological adaptations.</p>
