                    <h1>Acacia fitzgeraldii</h1>
<p>Acacia fitzgeraldii, commonly known as the Fitzgerald's wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and phyllodes that are typically linear to narrowly elliptic in shape. The plant produces yellow flower spikes during the winter months, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a common adaptation in acacia species to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Acacia fitzgeraldii is often found in sandy soils and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>
