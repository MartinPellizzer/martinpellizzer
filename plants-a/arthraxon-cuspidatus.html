<p>Arthraxon cuspidatus, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems with narrow, linear leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Arthraxon cuspidatus is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
