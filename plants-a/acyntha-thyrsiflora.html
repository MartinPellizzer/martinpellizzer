                <h1>Acyntha thyrsiflora</h1>
<p>Acyntha thyrsiflora, commonly known as the thyrso-flowered acyntha, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Boraginaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers arranged in thyrsiform inflorescences. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often glandular, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Acyntha thyrsiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acyntha thyrsiflora has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a glossy green color and slightly serrated margins.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, erect, and somewhat woody with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are clustered in dense thyrsoid inflorescences, with small white to pale blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and wing-like structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha thyrsiflora is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Western Cape Province, particularly in the fynbos biome. This plant thrives in coastal and mountainous regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in open vegetation types.</p>
<p>Acyntha thyrsiflora is an important component of the local flora and is valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha thyrsiflora was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread beyond cultivated areas into native vegetation. The plant is considered a potential weed in some regions because of its ability to colonize disturbed soils and compete with native species. Its distribution is primarily limited to the North Island, though it has been found in parts of the South Island as well.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread have been limited due to its low impact compared to other invasive species.</p>
