                <h1>Achillea rosmarinifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea rosmarinifolia, commonly known as maritime yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with a distinctive fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flower clusters that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in coastal or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea rosmarinifolia has compound, serrated leaves that are gray-green in color, with a rough texture and a narrow, linear shape, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, woody at the base, and has a grayish-brown bark with a slightly rough texture. The flowers are clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white petals and yellow centers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, allowing for wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea rosmarinifolia is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other areas, including parts of the United States and Australia, where it is sometimes cultivated. It thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is commonly found in open woodlands, grasslands, and coastal areas. This species typically grows at elevations between 0 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though its introduction to non-native regions may pose ecological risks.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea rosmarinifolia is a hardy perennial herb known for its aromatic foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining variety characteristics. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by rapid growth and flowering in early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its compact shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea rosmarinifolia is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small birds, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. This plant acts as an effective companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring flora by attracting beneficial insects. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing slopes and degraded lands.</p>
<p>It also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea rosmarinifolia is a flowering plant known for its aromatic leaves and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It has been traditionally used in herbal medicine to treat digestive issues and skin conditions due to its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities.
