<p>Arenaria fendleri subsp.</p>
<p>genuina, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to extreme temperatures and is often found in crevices or among rock formations.</p>
