                    <h1>Agrostis stolonifera f. diffusa</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonifera f. diffusa, commonly known as silvergrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features fine, silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence on its leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. It is often used in ornamental landscaping for its visual appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can suppress weeds.</p>
