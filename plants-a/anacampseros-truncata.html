<p>Anacampseros truncata, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Anacampseros truncata is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
