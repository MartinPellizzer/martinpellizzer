<p>Asclepias vomeriformis, commonly known as the vomerine milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is typical of the Asclepias genus and contains cardiac glycosides. It serves as a host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species, including the monarch and queen butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species.</p>
