                    <h1>Anthyllis grossheimii</h1>
<p>Anthyllis grossheimii, commonly known as the Ethiopian burr or sand burr, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Ethiopia and Eritrea.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the dry season. Its seed pods are distinctive, featuring hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or human clothing.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes.</p>
