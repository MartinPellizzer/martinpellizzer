                    <h1>Alisma subcordatum</h1>
<p>Alisma subcordatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a distinctive sub-cordate (heart-shaped) base. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils along streams, ponds, and marshes.</p>
<p>Alisma subcordatum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
