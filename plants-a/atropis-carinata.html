                    <h1>Atropis carinata</h1>
<p>Atropis carinata, commonly known as the ridge-leaf arrowhead, is a species of flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves with a distinct central ridge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shallow water environments.</p>
<p>Atropis carinata is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
