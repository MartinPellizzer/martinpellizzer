                <h1>Acnistus mollis</h1>
<p>Acnistus mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf shrub, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal spikes. Acnistus mollis is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus mollis has simple, opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 2–5 cm long and 1–2.5 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, somewhat woody, and have a smooth, pale green to brownish bark, growing in a creeping or ascending pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, with five petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in the plant's ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus mollis is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forests or along riverbanks. It is commonly used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these warm, humid climates where it can flourish.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus mollis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has become a common weed in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. The plant spreads primarily through its prolific seed production and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities and ecosystem balance.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in landscaping due to its rapid growth and hardiness.</p>
