<p>Abies hickelii, commonly known as the Mexican fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high elevations of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Abies hickelii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
