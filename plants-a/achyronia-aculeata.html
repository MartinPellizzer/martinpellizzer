                <h1>Achyronia aculeata</h1>
<p>Achyronia aculeata, commonly known as the spiny poinsettia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the center of the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and seasonal blooming make it a popular choice for festive decorations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia aculeata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in short, stiff hairs, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal spikes, with yellow petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread horizontally near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb moisture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia aculeata is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist lowland forests and along riverbanks in these areas. The plant thrives in humid environments with high rainfall and partial to full sunlight. It is often associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of Central America as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia aculeata was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is native to South America but has been introduced to several regions including parts of the United States and Australia. It is often found in roadside embankments and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential has raised concerns in some areas where it may outcompete native vegetation.</p>
