<p>It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers, which resemble a slipper in shape. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>The orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Ada keiliana has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a pale green bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry soil conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Ada keiliana is a rare and endangered species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited to specific areas in Sarawak, its current distribution is fragmented due to habitat loss and deforestation. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall and rich organic soil, typically found in the undergrowth of dense primary forests. Ada keiliana is usually found at altitudes between 300 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
