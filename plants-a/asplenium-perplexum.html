<p>Asplenium perplexum, commonly known as the perplexing spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Asplenium perplexum is noted for its morphological variability, which has led to confusion in its classification and naming.</p>
