                    <h1>Aa maderoi</h1>
<p>Aa maderoi, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and rich color. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native habitat.</p>
