<p>Adiantum capillus-veneris f. fissum, commonly known as the "Maiden's Tears" or "Veil Tarn," is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>The plant features a basal rosette of fertile fronds that are shorter and more robust than the sterile ones, which are longer and more slender. Its leaves are typically bright green, with a smooth, waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. The fronds are arranged in a fan-like pattern, giving the plant a graceful and elegant appearance.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
