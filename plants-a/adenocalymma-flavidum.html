                <h1>Adenocalymma flavidum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma flavidum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, making it a visually striking species.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma flavidum is often found in dune environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in coastal gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma flavidum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring around 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows in a spreading pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellow petals and a distinctive yellowish-green calyx, blooming during the warmer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma flavidum is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in rocky or sandy soils. This plant is commonly associated with savanna and woodland habitats. It is well adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent leaves and deep root system.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma flavidum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma flavidum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common weed in agricultural fields and along roadsides. This plant has been reported in several states across the southeastern United States, where it has established itself in both natural and disturbed ecosystems. Its introduction is likely due to its ability to spread through seeds carried by wind, water, or animals.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it poses a threat to native plant species and can reduce biodiversity in affected areas.</p>
