<p>Asplenium × sulcatum, commonly known as the sulcate shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is a compact, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features glossy, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive sulcate (grooved) appearance on the underside.
