<p>Achoriphragma runcinatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has basal leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface, and it produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy seed heads. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Achoriphragma runcinatum is adapted to arid conditions and is considered a resilient species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma runcinatum has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma runcinatum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Western Cape province, where it grows in coastal fynbos vegetation. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It is commonly associated with the region's unique biodiversity and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the area.</p>
<p>Achoriphragma runcinatum is a member of the Asteraceae family and is known for its distinctive yellow flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma runcinatum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in forested regions.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
