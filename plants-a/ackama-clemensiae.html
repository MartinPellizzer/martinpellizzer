                <h1>Ackama clemensiae</h1>
<p>Ackama clemensiae, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand strong mountain winds.</p>
<p>Ackama clemensiae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Ackama clemensiae has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated, serrated leaflets that range from 5 to 10 cm in length and are dark green on top with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that develops shallow ridges as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-white with five petals and stamens, blooming in late spring and being pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, nutrient-rich soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Ackama clemensiae is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly observed in the lowland and montane regions of the country. Ackama clemensiae is a member of the Meliaceae family, known for its ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to specific areas within New Guinea, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Ackama clemensiae was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 2000s in Oregon and Washington. The plant has since spread to adjacent areas, including parts of northern California. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native plant species.</p>
