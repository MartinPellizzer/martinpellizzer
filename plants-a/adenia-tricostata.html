                <h1>Adenia tricostata</h1>
<p>Adenia tricostata, commonly known as the three-costed adenia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features opposite, elliptical leaves with three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often arranged in clusters, and it produces woody capsules as fruit.</p>
<p>Adenia tricostata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia tricostata has compound, pinnate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with elliptic to ovate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is brown to reddish in color, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are showy, with five white petals and a yellow throat, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a fleshy capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant, helping it to climb and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia tricostata is primarily native to Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, DR Congo, and Uganda.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of these regions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the dense vegetation of these countries. Adenia tricostata is commonly encountered in lowland and mountainous areas across its range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the western and central parts of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia tricostata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of botanical collections and for ornamental purposes. The plant has since been found growing in native forests and on rocky outcrops. It is considered a potential weed due to its ability to spread rapidly in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
