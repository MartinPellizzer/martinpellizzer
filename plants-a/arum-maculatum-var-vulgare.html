                    <h1>Arum maculatum var. vulgare</h1>
<p>Arum maculatum var. vulgare, commonly known as the spotted arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features striking, arrow-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple and white mottled pattern on the underside. The plant produces a spadix, a central spike surrounded by a spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near water sources.</p>
<p>The spathe and spadix together create a showy, almost tropical appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
