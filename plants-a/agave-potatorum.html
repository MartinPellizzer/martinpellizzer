<p>Agave potatorum, commonly known as the blue agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are blue-gray in color and form a rosette pattern. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing small, white flowers. Its leaves contain a high concentration of sap, which is used to produce tequila and other agave-based spirits.</p>
<p>Agave potatorum is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
