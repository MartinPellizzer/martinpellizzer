                <h1>Acer sinense subsp. chekiangense</h1>
<p>Acer sinense subsp.</p>
<p>chekiangense, commonly known as the Chinese maple or Chiang Valley maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China. It typically grows to a height of 8â€“15 meters, featuring a spreading canopy and slender, branching form.</p>
<p>The leaves are palmately lobed, with a glossy green upper surface and a pale underside, turning vibrant red or orange in autumn. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer sinense subsp.</p>
<p>chekiangense has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a pointed tip and serrated edges, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length; the leaves are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, turning vibrant yellow in autumn. The stem is straight and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a single trunk growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered in cymes, with yellowish-green sepals and red stamens, blooming in early spring; they are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a paired samara, each winged seed dispersing by wind after maturing in late summer.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer sinense subsp.</p>
<p>chekiangense is a rare maple species native to eastern China, specifically the Zhejiang province. Its current distribution is limited to fragmented habitats in this region, where it grows in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in forests with high humidity and moderate temperatures, often found at altitudes between 600 and 1,200 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique subspecies.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer sinense subsp.</p>
<p>chekiangense is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and ecological balance.</p>
