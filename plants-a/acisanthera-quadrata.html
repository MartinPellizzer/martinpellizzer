                <h1>Acisanthera quadrata</h1>
<p>Acisanthera quadrata, commonly known as the four-square acacia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in compact, globular inflorescences, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Acisanthera quadrata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in such habitats.</p>
<p>It is occasionally cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acisanthera quadrata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, grayish bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with four petals that are white to pale pink in color, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera quadrata is primarily native to Belize, Bolivia, Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil South, Brazil Southeast, Brazil West-Central, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, Nicaragua, Panam√°, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along riverbanks. It is an important component of the local flora in these areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans a wide range of Central and South American countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera quadrata was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, wastelands, and abandoned fields. The plant spreads through its extensive root system, which helps bind the soil and prevent further degradation. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become established in several regions beyond its native range.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
