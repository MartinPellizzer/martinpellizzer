                <h1>Acinodendron cyathantherum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron cyathantherum, commonly known as the golden star tree, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that resemble stars. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red upon ripening. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a glossy surface.</p>
<p>Acinodendron cyathantherum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron cyathantherum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to elliptic leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring approximately 2â€“5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron cyathantherum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas within these countries. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with areas near rivers and in swampy or peaty soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become increasingly restricted in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron cyathantherum was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and along the edges of forests, thriving in sandy or loamy soils. The plant spreads rapidly through its fibrous root system and can outcompete native vegetation for resources. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it poses a threat to local biodiversity and ecosystem stability.</p>
