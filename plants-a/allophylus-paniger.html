<p>Allophylus paniger, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical,革质 (leathery) leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, woody fruits containing a single seed. Allophylus paniger is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been traditionally used in carving and furniture making.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in many parts of its range.</p>
