                    <h1>Astragalus vesicarius</h1>
<p>Astragalus vesicarius, commonly known as the blister milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Astragalus vesicarius is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife.</p>
