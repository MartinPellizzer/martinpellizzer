                <h1>Adinandra hirta</h1>
<p>Adinandra hirta, commonly known as the hairy adinandra, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra hirta has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size and a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly hairy, with a brownish color and a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help the plant anchor itself while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra hirta is primarily native to China South-Central, China Southeast, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It typically grows in forested habitats, often in shaded understory conditions. The species is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to the humid and diverse ecosystems of Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra hirta was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and degraded forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and moderate rainfall. The plant is commonly found in Southeast Asia, including countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It has been reported as an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact on local ecosystems.</p>
