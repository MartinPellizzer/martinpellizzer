                <h1>Achyrocline pterocaula</h1>
<p>Achyrocline pterocaula, commonly known as the Brazilian pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often arranged in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Achyrocline pterocaula is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline pterocaula has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale blue petals, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline pterocaula is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific regions within the Caribbean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline pterocaula was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It has been observed in parts of South America, the Caribbean, and some Pacific islands where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant is often found growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges, where it can establish itself quickly. Its introduction is likely due to human activities, including horticultural trade and accidental dispersal.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely undocumented in many regions.</p>
