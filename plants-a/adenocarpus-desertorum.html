                <h1>Adenocarpus desertorum</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus desertorum, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas in the desert environment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus desertorum has leaves that are typically narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, arranged alternately along the stem, with a pale green color and a size ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, grayish bark that grows in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with a pale yellow color, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, smooth seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus desertorum is primarily native to Spain.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern and central regions of the country, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly seen in scrublands and steppe environments. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to specific ecological zones within Spain.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus desertorum was mainly introduced to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture availability. The plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. Its introduction has led to its establishment as a pioneer species in these environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common weed in agricultural and natural landscapes.</p>
