                    <h1>Andromeda eriophylla</h1>
<p>Andromeda eriophylla, commonly known as the coastal snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is adapted to grow in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant produces bell-shaped, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are small, leathery, and densely packed, which helps reduce water loss in its coastal habitat.</p>
<p>Andromeda eriophylla is typically found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
