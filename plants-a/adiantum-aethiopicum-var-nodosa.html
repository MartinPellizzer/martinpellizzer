                    <h1>Adiantum aethiopicum var. nodosa</h1>
<p>Adiantum aethiopicum var. nodosa, commonly known as the nodding maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is native to parts of Africa, particularly Ethiopia. The plant features small, clustered spore cases called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two levels of pinnae, giving it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>This fern prefers moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
