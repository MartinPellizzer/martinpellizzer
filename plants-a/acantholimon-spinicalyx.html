                        <h1>Acantholimon spinicalyx</h1>
<p>Acantholimon spinicalyx, commonly known as the spinyleaf flax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Acantholimon spinicalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon spinicalyx belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of complex structures such as roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises a group of vascular plants that includes horsetails and their relatives, known for their primitive features and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by their diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes many succulent and halophytic species, often with distinctive floral morphology. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly known as the leadplant family, characterized by their often blue or purple flowers and specialized leaf structures. Its genus is Acantholimon, a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions, typically featuring small, spiny leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon spinicalyx, a specific plant within the genus known for its spiny leaves and flowering habits, adapted to thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon spinicalyx is primarily native to Iran.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country, particularly in the central and eastern parts. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often growing in mountainous areas. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can survive with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Iran.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon spinicalyx was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of flowering plants for horticultural and ornamental purposes. The plant is commonly found in coastal and subalpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has become naturalized in certain areas, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally limited due to its specific habitat requirements.</p>
