                    <h1>Armeria subulata</h1>
<p>Armeria subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Armeria subulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
