                <h1>Acroceras ridleyi</h1>
<p>Acroceras ridleyi, commonly known as the Ridley's acroceras, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has adapted to thrive in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are short and unbranched.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acroceras ridleyi is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroceras ridleyi has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish bark that grows in a creeping or ascending pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras ridleyi is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest margins. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed or secondary vegetation. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these regions.</p>
<p>Acroceras ridleyi is not found outside of its native range in the wild.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras ridleyi was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where there is ample sunlight and moderate to high levels of moisture. The plant is often found in coastal areas, disturbed forests, and along roadsides. Its introduction has been associated with human activities such as land clearing and transportation corridors.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems remains a subject of ongoing study.</p>
