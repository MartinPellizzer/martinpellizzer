                    <h1>Acacia tenuior</h1>
<p>Acacia tenuior, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry branches and phyllodes that are narrow and often curved. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually reduced to phyllodes, which help minimize water loss and are a key botanical feature of the species.</p>
