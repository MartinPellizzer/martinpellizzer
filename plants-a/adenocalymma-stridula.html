                <h1>Adenocalymma stridula</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma stridula, commonly known as the stridulous adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma stridula has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a sprawling or ascending manner. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green with prominent stamens, blooming during the spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in moisture absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma stridula is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern part of the country, particularly in the states of Paran√°, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul. This plant thrives in grasslands and open areas with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with the Southern Brazilian grasslands ecosystem.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma stridula is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the temperate climate of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma stridula was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Texas, as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and vacant lots. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown invasive tendencies in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means have raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its spread beyond controlled environments.</p>
