<p>Atriplex spongiosa, commonly known as the spongebrush, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in desert environments. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray leaves, which are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Its small greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, dry fruits called capsules.</p>
<p>Atriplex spongiosa is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
