                    <h1>Albuca coarctata</h1>
<p>Albuca coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved albuca, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant produces striking, spiky inflorescences with white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Albuca coarctata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
