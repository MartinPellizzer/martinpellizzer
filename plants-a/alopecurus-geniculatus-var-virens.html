<p>Alopecurus geniculatus var. virens, commonly known as green bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens or used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
