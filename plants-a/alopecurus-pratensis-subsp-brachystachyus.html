<p>Alopecurus pratensis subsp.</p>
<p>brachystachyus, commonly known as the meadow foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, compressed stems that often form dense clumps.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are shorter than those of the typical *A. pratensis*, giving it its subspecies name *brachystachyus*. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy underside.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in moist meadows and pastures, where it contributes to soil stabilization and serves as forage for livestock.</p>
