                <h1>Acer rubrum subsp. carolinianum</h1>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>carolinianum, commonly known as the Carolinian red maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive red foliage in the fall, which can range from bright orange to deep crimson.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically ovate with coarsely serrated edges and a pointed tip. It produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>carolinianum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a coarsely toothed margin, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The leaves are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, turning bright red to orange in the fall.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and grayish-brown, with a straight growth pattern, and the bark becomes furrowed with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two wings, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>carolinianum is a subspecies of the red maple native to the southeastern United States, primarily found in Florida and parts of Georgia and South Carolina. Its current distribution includes areas where it was historically present, though it is now considered extinct in much of its former range.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, acidic soils along riverbanks, swamps, and wetlands, often in forested environments. This subspecies typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, usually below 300 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and historical overharvesting, it is listed as endangered or critically endangered in several states, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>carolinianum is a native deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and adaptability to various environments. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy during winter. It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like leaf spot or aphids.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>carolinianum is a native tree that provides food and shelter for a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its seeds are a food source for small mammals and birds.</p>
<p>It acts as an erosion control plant due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil. Additionally, it serves as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity and enhancing habitat structure.</p>
<p>This species also contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>
