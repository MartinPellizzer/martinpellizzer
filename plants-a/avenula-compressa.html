                    <h1>Avenula compressa</h1>
<p>Avenula compressa, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically compressed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. Avenula compressa thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ability to form dense mats makes it an important component of certain ecosystems.</p>
