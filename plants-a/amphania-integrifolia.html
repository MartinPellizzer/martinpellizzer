<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a dense, fibrous sheath. The leaves are lance-shaped, with smooth margins and a broad, flat structure that aids in water retention. Its reproductive structures include small, clustered spore-bearing leaves called sporophylls.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
