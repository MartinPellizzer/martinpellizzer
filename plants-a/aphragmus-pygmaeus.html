<p>Aphragmus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It produces small, white, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its stems and leaves attached to the host. It is native to parts of North America and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, forming dense clusters on its host.</p>
