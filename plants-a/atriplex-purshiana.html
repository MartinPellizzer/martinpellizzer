<p>Atriplex purshiana, commonly known as shadscale, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, powdery hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to saline soils and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Atriplex purshiana plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife in desert ecosystems.</p>
