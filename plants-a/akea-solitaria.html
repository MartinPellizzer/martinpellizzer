<p>Akea solitaria, commonly known as the solitary akea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, delicate white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Akea solitaria is considered critically endangered.</p>
