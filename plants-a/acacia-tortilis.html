                        <h1>Acacia tortilis</h1>
<p>Acacia tortilis, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by its long, drooping branches. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves, reducing water loss in arid environments. Its yellow flowers are produced in dense, globular clusters and attract various pollinators.</p>
<p>Acacia tortilis is well adapted to hot, dry climates and plays an important ecological role in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia tortilis belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of complex structures such as roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a unique structure known as a rhizome and includes ferns and horsetails. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Malvales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have showy flowers and includes families such as Malvaceae. Its family is Malvaceae, commonly known as the mallow family, which includes plants with distinctive flowers and cotton-like seeds.
