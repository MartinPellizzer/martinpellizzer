<p>Allium scaberrimum, commonly known as the bitter leek, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its hollow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pale purple or white flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though they are known for their strong, pungent odor. Allium scaberrimum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and medicinal studies.</p>
