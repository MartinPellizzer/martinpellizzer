                    <h1>Apophragma</h1>
<p>Apophragma, commonly known as the "false dandelion," is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by spherical, fluffy seed heads similar to those of dandelions. Apophragma is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
