                        <h1>Acacia densifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia densifolia, commonly known as the denseleaf wattle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has compound leaves composed of multiple small, oval-shaped leaflets. Acacia densifolia is well adapted to sandy soils and salty coastal environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia densifolia is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and woodland habitats. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or sandy substrates. It is adapted to the seasonal rainfall patterns of the region.</p>
<p>Acacia densifolia is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia densifolia was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and for its ornamental value in landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and sandy areas where it helps stabilize dunes and prevent wind erosion. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its rapid growth and hardiness, it has been used in reclamation projects across several regions.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential has raised concerns in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
