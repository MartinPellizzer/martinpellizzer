                <h1>Aconitum nevadense</h1>
<p>Aconitum nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada aconite, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spikelike inflorescences. Its leaves are palmately divided and have a rough, hairy texture, typical of many members of its family.</p>
<p>Aconitum nevadense is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum nevadense has leaves that are compound, with palmately arranged leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, typically 5–10 cm in length, and have a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, usually reaching 1–2 meters in height, with a smooth, bluish-green bark that becomes rougher and darker with age. The flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, arranged in tall, spikelike clusters, and bloom in late summer to early fall; they are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted for anchoring the plant in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum nevadense is primarily native to France, Morocco, and Spain.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in mountainous regions within these countries. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky soils. Aconitum nevadense is part of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its toxic alkaloids.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with high elevation environments across these European and North African regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum nevadense was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in high-elevation areas of Nevada and California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky soils and open meadows at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 6,000 feet. This plant thrives in full sun and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. It is often mistaken for native aconitum species due to its similar appearance.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
