<p>Arachnorchis christineae, commonly known as the Christine's spider orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the wet tropical regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a slender, spider-like labellum that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in dense undergrowth, relying on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. It blooms during the cooler months, producing small, pale green or yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
