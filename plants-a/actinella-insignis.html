                <h1>Actinella insignis</h1>
<p>Actinella insignis, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with distinctive cyathia, or cup-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are surrounded by leaf-like bracts, and it produces capsules containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Actinella insignis is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella insignis has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, measuring approximately 1â€“3 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, with a smooth texture. The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, with a structure that includes four petals and stamens, and it is primarily pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella insignis is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and along the Pacific coastline. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and coastal scrub. It is often associated with sandy or gravelly soils in these regions.</p>
<p>Actinella insignis is an important part of the local flora and is adapted to the temperate climate of the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella insignis was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, including horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in disturbed soils and open areas, often near human settlements. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of conditions has contributed to its spread in non-native regions. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact varies depending on the local environment and native flora.</p>
