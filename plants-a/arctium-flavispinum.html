<p>Arctium flavispinum, commonly known as the yellow burr or yellow thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers that are followed by spiky, bristly fruits known as burrs. These burrs have hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing.</p>
<p>Arctium flavispinum is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and it has some medicinal uses in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
