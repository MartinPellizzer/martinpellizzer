                <h1>Adenocaulon integrifolium</h1>
<p>Adenocaulon integrifolium, commonly known as the smoothleaf pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, smooth, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its stems are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Adenocaulon integrifolium is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocaulon integrifolium has leaves that are entire, ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, greenish-gray bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it grows in a compact, low shrub-like form. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white to pale pink petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocaulon integrifolium is primarily native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in states such as California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona. This plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, including rocky soils and open woodlands. It is commonly associated with areas that have a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Adenocaulon integrifolium is often found in elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocaulon integrifolium was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates, particularly in the northeastern and northwestern United States. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often seen in disturbed sites such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its presence is often associated with areas that have been recently cleared or experienced some form of ecological disturbance.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in many regions where it has been introduced.</p>
