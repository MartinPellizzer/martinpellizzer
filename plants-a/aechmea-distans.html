                <h1>Aechmea distans</h1>
<p>Aechmea distans, commonly known as the silver vase plant, is a bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from pink to red. Its foliage is often covered in a silvery bloom, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Aechmea distans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as an ornamental plant in gardens and indoor settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea distans has rosette-shaped leaves that are sword-like, arranged in a tight spiral, with a bright green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, and its base is covered in a dense, fibrous mat of roots that help anchor it and absorb moisture. It produces inflorescences with showy, spathaceous bracts that enclose clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, which bloom during the rainy season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that disperses seeds through wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are primarily fibrous and adapted for epiphytic growth, allowing the plant to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
