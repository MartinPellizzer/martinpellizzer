                <h1>Acrocarpidium urospermum</h1>
<p>Acrocarpidium urospermum, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, leafless stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Acrocarpidium urospermum is often overlooked due to its diminutive size and inconspicuous appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocarpidium urospermum has leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellowish-white petals and a tubular structure, blooming in late spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpidium urospermum is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and dry habitats, often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. This plant is commonly associated with limestone and clay soils, growing in open, sunny environments. Its distribution includes countries such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey.</p>
<p>It is a rare and specialized species, often found in microhabitats that provide specific ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpidium urospermum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste grounds, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and well-drained soil conditions. This plant is often found in regions where human activity has altered the natural landscape. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native regions outside its original range.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can spread rapidly in suitable environments.</p>
