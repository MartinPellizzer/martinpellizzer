                <h1>Adenia peirrei</h1>
<p>Adenia peirrei, commonly known as the West African climbing adenium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Nigeria and Ghana. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Adenia peirrei is also noted for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia peirrei has compound, pinnate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically reddish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a tendency to branch out. The flowers are large, showy, and have a complex structure with five petals, typically in shades of red or orange, blooming during the warm season, and are pollinated primarily by birds. The fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains several small seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant, though specific details about their structure are less commonly documented.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia peirrei is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the wetter regions of the Cape York Peninsula and the adjacent areas of the Atherton Tablelands. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soils. It is commonly encountered in the understorey of primary and secondary rainforest habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Adenia peirrei is relatively localized within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia peirrei was mainly introduced to disturbed areas and along roadsides in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. This plant is commonly seen in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and parts of Australia. It has been reported as an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands.</p>
<p>Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as land clearing and landscaping.</p>
