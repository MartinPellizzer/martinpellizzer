                <h1>Adiantum scandicinum</h1>
<p>Adiantum scandicinum, commonly known as the climbing maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a finely toothed margin. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are wiry and allow it to climb, making it an epiphytic species.</p>
<p>Adiantum scandicinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum scandicinum has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture. The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and grows vertically, often twining around supports. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, with a structure consisting of separate sepals and petals, and it is wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, and the roots are fibrous, helping to anchor the plant to its substrate.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum scandicinum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in moist, shaded environments like forests and rocky areas. This fern thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with mountainous terrain. It is typically found growing on cliffs, trees, or in shaded undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Southeast Asia where the climate and habitat conditions are suitable for its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum scandicinum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, particularly in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky or wooded habitats where it can climb or trail along surfaces. This plant is often found in disturbed or cultivated areas, such as gardens and along trails. Its introduction has been noted in several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to tolerate various soil conditions.</p>
