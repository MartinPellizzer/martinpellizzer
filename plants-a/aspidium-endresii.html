<p>Aspidium endresii, commonly known as the Endres' water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing sporangia. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Aspidium endresii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
