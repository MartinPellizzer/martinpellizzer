                <h1>Adhatoda chrysotrichoma</h1>
<p>Adhatoda chrysotrichoma, commonly known as the hairy adhatoda, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported respiratory and antimicrobial properties.</p>
<p>The hairy trichomes on its stems and leaves give it a unique appearance and may play a role in its ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda chrysotrichoma has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light brown color and a creeping growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and a yellow center, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda chrysotrichoma is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid climates with well-drained soil. This plant is often associated with moist forested areas and is sometimes seen growing near water sources. Its native range extends to parts of Africa and the Middle East as well.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional medicinal uses in various cultures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda chrysotrichoma was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant is often cultivated for its medicinal properties, particularly for its use in traditional medicine. Its distribution has been expanded through human activity, including horticulture and ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments.</p>
