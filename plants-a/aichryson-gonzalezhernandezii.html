The plant features small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow or white, typically during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
