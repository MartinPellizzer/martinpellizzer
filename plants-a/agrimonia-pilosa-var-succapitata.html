The plant produces bright red to orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Its roots are fibrous and can form a dense mat, making it a hardy plant that thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Agrimony is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas, and it has been historically used in herbal medicine.</p>
