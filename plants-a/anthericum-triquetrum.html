<p>Anthericum triquetrum, commonly known as the three-angled lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear whorled leaves with a distinctive three-angled cross-section. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Anthericum triquetrum is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
