                <h1>Achras caimito</h1>
<p>Achras caimito, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring a dense, symmetrical crown and smooth, gray bark. The plant produces large, green, heart-shaped leaves that are palmate, with five to seven lobes. Its most notable botanical feature is the fruit, which is a large, spiky, green to yellowish berry that ripens to a creamy white or yellow color.</p>
<p>The fruit is botanically classified as a syncarp, formed from the fusion of multiple berries into a single, fleshy structure.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras caimito has large, palmate leaves that are deeply divided, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that grows upright and forms a trunk-like structure. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that splits open to release fleshy, edible seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Its roots are deep and fibrous, helping it anchor in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras caimito is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean, specifically found in countries such as Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Central and South America, as well as some regions in the Pacific Islands. It thrives in warm, humid environments with well-drained soils, typically in lowland tropical forests. Achras caimito is usually found at altitudes below 500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras caimito is a tropical fruit-bearing plant known for its ornamental value and edible fruit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within 2-3 years, and thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and pruning to shape the plant and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. Common pests include fruit flies and scale insects, while diseases like root rot can occur if the soil is too wet.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve the overall health of the plant.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras caimito is a tropical plant that provides food for both humans and wildlife, including its fruit which is edible and nutritious.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds, which help in its reproduction and contribute to biodiversity. The plant also acts as a natural erosion control agent due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil. Additionally, it serves as a source of shelter and habitat for various small animals and insects.</p>
<p>Its ecological benefits make it an important component of tropical ecosystems.</p>
