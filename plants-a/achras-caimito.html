                <h1>Achras caimito</h1>
<p>Achras caimito, commonly known as the custard apple tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring a dense canopy and thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fruits that are oval or spherical in shape. The fruit has a thick, leathery skin and a sweet, creamy pulp with a custard-like texture.</p>
<p>It is valued for its edible fruit and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras caimito has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, typically ranging from 10 to 20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and unbranched, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rough and fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in terminal panicles, blooming during the dry season, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by animals attracted to the fruit's fleshy, sweet pulp.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras caimito is primarily native to Central and South America, particularly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in humid lowland areas. This plant is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and other dense tropical forests where it benefits from high rainfall and warm temperatures. It is also occasionally cultivated in other parts of the world for its fruit, which is known as the "caimito" or "carambola.".</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes riverine forests and secondary growth areas where it can establish itself easily.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras caimito was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its edible fruit, known as caimito or cherimoya.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils, making it suitable for cultivation in parts of Central and South America, as well as in some regions of the Caribbean. The plant is often grown in home gardens and small farms due to its ornamental value and fruit production. Its introduction has also been associated with ornamental horticulture in some parts of the world.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely naturalized outside its native range.</p>
