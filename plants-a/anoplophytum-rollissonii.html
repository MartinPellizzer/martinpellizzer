                    <h1>Anoplophytum rollissonii</h1>
<p>Anoplophytum rollissonii, commonly known as the Namib Desert grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It has a dense, mat-forming growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, adapted to the harsh desert environment. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources in the arid soils.</p>
<p>This species plays a crucial role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
