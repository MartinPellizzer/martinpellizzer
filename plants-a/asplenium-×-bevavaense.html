<p>Asplenium × bevavaense, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically display a dark green color with a slightly glossy texture.

Asplenium × bevavaense thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and landscape design.</p>
