<p>Alsine minuta, commonly known as the dwarf alsike, is a small annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a hard, smooth capsule, which splits open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Alsine minuta is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
