                    <h1>Acacia merinthophora</h1>
<p>Acacia merinthophora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical spikes, which bloom from late autumn to early spring. Its seeds are encased in woody pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Acacia merinthophora is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia.</p>
