<p>Anisodontea julii subsp.</p>
<p>prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate anisodontea, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is adapted to arid conditions and requires minimal water once established.</p>
