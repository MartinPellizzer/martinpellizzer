<p>Alloschmidia, commonly known as the "false sandwort," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically small, herbaceous perennials that thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. They are characterized by their succulent leaves and small, often clustered flowers that can be white, pink, or purple. Alloschmidia species are found primarily in regions of southern Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them well-adapted to harsh, dry climates, with mechanisms to store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
