<p>Alopecurus seravschanicus, commonly known as the Crimean mouse-ear grass, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its small, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-white flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
