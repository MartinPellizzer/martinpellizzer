                    <h1>Arenaria serpyllifolia var. cantabrica</h1>
<p>Arenaria serpyllifolia var. cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically linear and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves and more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form.</p>
