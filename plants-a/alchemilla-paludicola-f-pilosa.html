                    <h1>Alchemilla paludicola f. pilosa</h1>
<p>Alchemilla paludicola f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wet meadows and marshy areas in northern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild astringent properties.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its dense, hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in damp environments.</p>
