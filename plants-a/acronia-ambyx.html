                <h1>Acronia ambyx</h1>
<p>Acronia ambyx, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in association with other wetland flora.</p>
<p>Acronia ambyx plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia ambyx has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are pale yellow with five petals and stamens, blooming in late spring and attracting bees for pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia ambyx is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions and is often associated with disturbed or transitional zones within these wetlands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of wetland health.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia ambyx was mainly introduced to areas with suitable soil and climate conditions, particularly in regions with temperate to subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. The plant has been reported in several countries across Europe and parts of Asia. Its introduction has been linked to human activities such as horticulture and land modification.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to limited long-term data.</p>
