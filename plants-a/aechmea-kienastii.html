<p>Aechmea kienastii, commonly known as the Kienast's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for hydration. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with red, orange, or yellow flowers that bloom for several weeks. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a silvery appearance and aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Aechmea kienastii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish.</p>
