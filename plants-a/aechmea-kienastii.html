                <h1>Aechmea kienastii</h1>
<p>Aechmea kienastii, commonly known as the Kienast's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for hydration. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with red, orange, or yellow flowers that bloom for several weeks. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a silvery appearance and aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Aechmea kienastii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea kienastii has rosette-shaped leaves that are sword-like, arranged in a compact circle, with a waxy, dark green surface and a reddish or purple underside.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, thick stem covered in a fibrous, reddish-brown bark, growing from the base of the rosette. Its flowers are clustered in a spike at the center of the rosette, with tubular structures that range from white to pink, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spiny, red berry that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>
