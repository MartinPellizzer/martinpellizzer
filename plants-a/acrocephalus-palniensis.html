                <h1>Acrocephalus palniensis</h1>
<p>Acrocephalus palniensis, commonly known as the Palni reed, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Western Ghats of India, particularly in the Palni Hills region. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Acrocephalus palniensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and marshy areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus palniensis has leaves that are linear, narrow, and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette with a bluish-green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is typically clumping. Its flowers are spike-like, with small, greenish-white blooms that appear in summer, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus palniensis is primarily native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is found in the states of Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as undergrowth in forests. It is often associated with dense vegetation in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the Western Ghats ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus palniensis was mainly introduced to new habitats in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there through human activities such as trade or accidental transport. The plant has adapted well to the tropical climate and is now found growing in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in abandoned fields. Its rapid spread has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is also studied for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
