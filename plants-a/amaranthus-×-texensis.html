<p>Amaranthus × texensis, commonly known as tumbleweed, is an annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and the production of dry, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a papery husk. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>After flowering, the plant forms a spherical, woody capsule that detaches and rolls across the ground, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
