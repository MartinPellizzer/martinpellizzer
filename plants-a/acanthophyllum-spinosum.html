                    <h1>Acanthophyllum spinosum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum spinosum, commonly known as the spiny acanthophyllum, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum spinosum plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
