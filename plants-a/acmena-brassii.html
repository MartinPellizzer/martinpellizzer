                <h1>Acmena brassii</h1>
<p>Acmena brassii, commonly known as the silky ash or golden ash, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are often tinged with yellow or red on the underside. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spherical, yellowish-green fruits that split open to release seeds. Acmena brassii is valued for its ornamental appeal, with its striking foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is also used in horticulture for its shade-providing capabilities and adaptability to coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena brassii has compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with ovate to elliptic leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale greyish-brown bark that exfoliates in thin layers. The flowers are small, fragrant, and white to pale yellow, arranged in clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena brassii is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically the eastern coastal regions of New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in subtropical and tropical rainforests, as well as in moist, shaded environments within these areas. The plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often seen growing in the understorey of dense forest vegetation. It is known for its striking yellow flowers and is a popular ornamental plant in cultivation.</p>
<p>Acmena brassii is also sometimes referred to as the "Brisbane flame" due to its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena brassii was mainly introduced to urban and suburban landscapes in Australia for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides due to its attractive foliage and small white flowers. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it a popular choice for landscaping. However, it has also been reported to spread into natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to discussions about its ecological impact in non-native environments.</p>
