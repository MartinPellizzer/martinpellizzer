                <h1>Adhatoda bahiensis</h1>
<p>Adhatoda bahiensis, commonly known as the Brazilian arrowroot or Brazilian sarsaparilla, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a climbing shrub that belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in spikes. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and expectorant effects.</p>
<p>Adhatoda bahiensis is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential to treat respiratory ailments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda bahiensis has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern, with a grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are tubular, with five lobes, and are usually blue or violet in color, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and often form a dense network near the surface, aiding in the plant's climbing habit.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda bahiensis is primarily native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and surrounding areas. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. It is often seen growing in moist forest understories and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda bahiensis was mainly introduced to control the spread of invasive weeds in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high human activity, such as roadsides and abandoned fields. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with moderate rainfall. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas make it effective for erosion control.</p>
<p>However, it can become a weed itself if not managed properly.</p>
