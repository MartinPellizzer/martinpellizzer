                <h1>Acrostichum speciosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum speciosum, commonly known as the ornate brake fern, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae).</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into compound leaves. Its fronds are characterized by their intricate, lace-like patterns and are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Acrostichum speciosum is native to the Americas and thrives in humid climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum speciosum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are usually broad and dark green, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that has a fibrous texture. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, blooming in late summer, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum speciosum is primarily native to the Andaman Is., Bismarck Archipelago, Caroline Is., Fiji, Hainan, Lesser Sunda Is., Madagascar, Malaya, Maluku, New Caledonia, New Guinea, New South Wales, Nicobar Is., Northern Territory, Philippines, Queensland, Seychelles, Solomon Is., Sulawesi, Thailand, Vanuatu, Vietnam, and Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often near brackish or freshwater habitats. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, typically in moist, shaded environments. It is a member of the palms family and is known for its large, fan-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Its wide distribution across these regions highlights its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum speciosum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites where it can thrive in moist, sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and partial shade, such as along shorelines and in wetlands. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system and rapid growth. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various coastal ecosystems, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-invasive species in most regions where it is introduced.</p>
