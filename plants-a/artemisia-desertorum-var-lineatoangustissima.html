                    <h1>Artemisia desertorum var. lineatoangustissima</h1>
<p>Artemisia desertorum var. lineatoangustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf sagebrush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to low precipitation and high temperatures.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in desert and semi-desert ecosystems, playing a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
