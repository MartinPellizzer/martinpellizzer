                    <h1>Adolia arenicola</h1>
<p>Adolia arenicola, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in arid and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crust-like growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to rocky surfaces. This plant is primarily composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which enables it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its ability to withstand extreme temperatures and low moisture makes it a pioneer species in harsh landscapes.</p>
<p>Adolia arenicola plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
