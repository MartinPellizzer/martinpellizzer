                <h1>Adolia arenicola</h1>
<p>Adolia arenicola, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in arid and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crust-like growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to rocky surfaces. This plant is primarily composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which enables it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its ability to withstand extreme temperatures and low moisture makes it a pioneer species in harsh landscapes.</p>
<p>Adolia arenicola plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adolia arenicola has small, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows in a creeping manner along the ground. It produces tiny, yellowish flowers with four petals, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, allowing the plant to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adolia arenicola is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal and saline environments, often found in dunes and rocky shores. This plant is well adapted to harsh, arid conditions and can tolerate high levels of salt in the soil. It plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with a temperate climate and limited rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adolia arenicola was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as land development and transportation.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in disturbed soils along roadsides and in urban areas. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which can be carried by wind, water, or animals. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is now considered an invasive species in several regions.</p>
