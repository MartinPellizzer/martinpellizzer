<p>Antholyza orchidiflora, commonly known as the orchid-flowered antholyza, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family.</p>

The plant is characterized by its vibrant, orchid-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
