                            <h1>Artemisia Lucentica</h1>
<p>Blue artemisia, scientifically known as Artemisia lucentica, is a striking plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. Its most distinctive feature is its vivid blue-gray foliage, which shimmers in the sunlight. This hardy shrub is often found in rocky soils and dry landscapes, thriving in harsh conditions. It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its aromatic and antiseptic properties. Today, it is also appreciated for its ornamental value in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
