                    <h1>Acrostichum rubescens</h1>
<p>Acrostichum rubescens, commonly known as the red fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically reddish in color, especially when young. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water sources. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread to form dense mats, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas.</p>
<p>The red fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity.</p>
