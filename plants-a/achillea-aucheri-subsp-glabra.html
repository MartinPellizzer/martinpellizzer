                <h1>Achillea aucheri subsp. glabra</h1>
<p>Achillea aucheri subsp.</p>
<p>glabra, commonly known as the smooth yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate, with a smooth texture and a silvery-green hue.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, flat, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and long flowering period make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea aucheri subsp.</p>
<p>glabra has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture. The stem is upright, with a smooth, slightly greenish bark, and exhibits a branching growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea aucheri subsp.</p>
<p>glabra is a flowering plant native to the western regions of Turkey, specifically the Aegean and Mediterranean areas. It is now also found in parts of southern Europe, including Greece and southern Italy, where it has been introduced.</p>
<p>This species thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and open woodlands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The conservation status of this subspecies is currently listed as least concern, though it faces threats from habitat loss and overcollection in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea aucheri subsp.</p>
<p>glabra is a hardy, herbaceous perennial known for its flat, white or pale yellow flower heads and silvery foliage. It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rootstock in early spring.</p>
<p>This plant has a biennial growth cycle, flowering in its second year before dying back, though it often self-seeds and reappears each spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs, and it pairs well with lavender, thyme, and other drought-tolerant perennials.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
