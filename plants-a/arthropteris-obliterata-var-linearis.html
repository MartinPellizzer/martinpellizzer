                    <h1>Arthropteris obliterata var. linearis</h1>
<p>Arthropteris obliterata var. linearis, commonly known as the linear holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern genus characterized by its slender, linear fronds.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a dense, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
