                <h1>Adonis mongolica</h1>
<p>Adonis mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces follicles that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Adonis mongolica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its challenging growth requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis mongolica has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often branched, with a smooth, slightly woody texture and a light green to reddish-brown color. Its flowers are solitary, cup-shaped, with bright yellow petals and a central greenish-yellow corolla, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The plant produces a follicle-type fruit that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis mongolica is primarily native to Mongolia.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Altai and Khangai mountain ranges. This plant thrives in rocky and semi-arid environments. It is adapted to the cold and harsh climate of central Asia.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes grasslands and steppe areas with well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis mongolica was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant is often found in regions of Central Asia, including Mongolia and parts of Russia. It has been introduced to various parts of Europe and North America as an ornamental species.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has established itself in some invasive plant communities in non-native regions.</p>
