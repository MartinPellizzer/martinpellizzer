                <h1>Adiantum novae-caledoniae</h1>
<p>Adiantum novae-caledoniae, commonly known as the New Caledonia maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive rachis that is grooved and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Adiantum novae-caledoniae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum novae-caledoniae has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a feathery appearance, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measuring around 20â€“30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a bright green color, with a delicate and slender structure. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is covered in a smooth, light green bark, growing in a rosette form. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a spore-bearing capsule that disperses spores through wind, and the roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum novae-caledoniae is primarily native to New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this French overseas territory in the South Pacific. This species is endemic to the region, meaning it is not found anywhere else in the world. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments within the island's unique ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its restricted distribution highlights its ecological significance and the importance of conserving its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum novae-caledoniae was mainly introduced to New Caledonia, where it has become naturalized in certain areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. The plant's introduction is likely due to its adaptability to humid tropical climates. It is often seen growing along stream banks and in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
