                <h1>Adenophora kulunensis</h1>
<p>Adenophora kulunensis, commonly known as the Kulun bellflower, is a flowering plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions and is adapted to temperate climates. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>Adenophora kulunensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora kulunensis has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a greenish-brown bark with a rough texture. Its flowers are bell-shaped, arranged in clusters, and typically have a pale blue to purple color, blooming in summer and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora kulunensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, including the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, and parts of Inner Mongolia.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in forested areas and on rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters. This species is also present in the Korean Peninsula and has been recorded in some regions of Russia. It is often associated with moist, well-drained soils and is considered a rare or endemic species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora kulunensis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate sunlight and cool temperatures. This plant is commonly found in alpine and subalpine meadows, where it forms dense stands. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of China, including the Tibetan Plateau and northern provinces.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become an important species for ecological restoration projects in these areas.</p>
