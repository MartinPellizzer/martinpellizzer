                <h1>Aconitum alboflavidum</h1>
<p>Aconitum alboflavidum, commonly known as the white-yellow aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. The plant features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically from July to September. Its leaves are palmately compound, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Aconitum alboflavidum is known for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that can be harmful to both humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum alboflavidum has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter green underside, and can reach up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rough and fissured as the plant matures. Its flowers are blue to purple in color, arranged in dense spires, consisting of five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, and bloom from July to August, being pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in moist, cool environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum alboflavidum is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Sichuan, Hubei, and Guizhou provinces. This plant typically grows in moist, temperate forests and mountainous areas. It is often associated with rocky soils and elevated terrain.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific habitats within this geographic region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum alboflavidum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, colorful flowers.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the continent in the 19th century by European botanists and gardeners who admired its unique appearance. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native flora in wetland and riparian habitats. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes have made it a challenge for ecosystem management.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the unintended ecological consequences of introducing non-native species for aesthetic purposes.</p>
