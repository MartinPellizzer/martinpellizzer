<p>Anacheilium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf anacheilium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its stems are slender and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
