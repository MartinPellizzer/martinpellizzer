                    <h1>Aconitum pyramidale var. bauhini</h1>
<p>Aconitum pyramidale var. bauhini, commonly known as the Pyramidal Monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking purple-blue flowers arranged in a spire-like cluster, typical of the Aconitum genus. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces toxic alkaloids, making it highly poisonous to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens, though caution is necessary due to its potent toxicity.</p>
