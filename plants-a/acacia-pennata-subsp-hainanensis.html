                        <h1>Acacia pennata subsp. hainanensis</h1>
<p>Acacia pennata subsp.</p>
<p>hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and phyllodes that are typically straight or slightly curved.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a common feature in the genus Acacia, reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in open forests or along coastal areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia pennata subsp.</p>
<p>hainanensis is primarily native to southern China, specifically the island of Hainan. It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of this area, particularly in lowland and hill forests.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in secondary growth forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to Hainan, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia pennata subsp.</p>
<p>hainanensis was mainly introduced to China, particularly in the southern provinces such as Hainan, Guangdong, and Guangxi. It is commonly found in lowland areas with well-drained soils and is often used for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of timber. It has been introduced to various ecological restoration projects to enhance biodiversity and prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
