<p>Acacia pennata subsp.</p>
<p>hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and phyllodes that are typically straight or slightly curved.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a common feature in the genus Acacia, reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in open forests or along coastal areas.</p>
