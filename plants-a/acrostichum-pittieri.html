<p>Acrostichum pittieri, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in humid lowland forests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across the forest floor, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, with a glossy surface and a distinctive, finely divided structure.</p>
