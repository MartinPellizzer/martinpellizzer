                    <h1>Athyrium costaricense</h1>
<p>Athyrium costaricense, commonly known as the Costa Rican lady fern, is a species of fern native to the humid forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or pendulous. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
