                    <h1>Astracantha albifolia</h1>
<p>Astracantha albifolia, commonly known as the white-leafed cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in white, woolly hair, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its pale foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, a common adaptation in cacti for protection and water conservation.</p>
<p>Astracantha albifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
