                <h1>Adenophora lamarckii</h1>
<p>Adenophora lamarckii, commonly known as the blue bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Adenophora lamarckii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora lamarckii has alternate, lanceolate leaves that are typically 3–8 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, with a bluish-green upper surface and a pale underside.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, somewhat hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. The flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and range from pale blue to violet, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora lamarckii is primarily native to Altay, Irkutsk, Kazakhstan, Korea, Krasnoyarsk, Mongolia, Tuva, and Xinjiang.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in these regions across Central Asia and East Asia. It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with mountainous and semi-arid environments. Adenophora lamarckii is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions in these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora lamarckii was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates, particularly in parts of Europe and Asia. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it adaptable to various habitats. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some non-native areas, where it can compete with native flora.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
