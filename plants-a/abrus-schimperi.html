                        <h1>Abrus schimperi</h1>
<p>Abrus schimperi, commonly known as the African snail bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It produces distinctive, showy red and black seed pods that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional practices. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its flowers are yellow with a purple or reddish tint, adding visual interest to its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus schimperi is primarily native to East Africa, including countries such as Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as savannas and rocky areas. The plant thrives in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate and is often associated with disturbed soils. It is a climbing plant that can be found in both wild and cultivated settings.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also reported in parts of southern Arabia and the Horn of Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus schimperi was mainly introduced to new habitats outside its native range, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It has been reported in various regions, including parts of Africa and Asia, where it has established itself in disturbed environments. The plant thrives in areas with well-drained soil and full sun, making it adaptable to different ecological conditions. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, more research is needed to fully understand its ecological impact and distribution patterns.</p>
