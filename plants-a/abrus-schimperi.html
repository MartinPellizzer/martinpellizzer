                <h1>Abrus schimperi</h1>
<p>Abrus schimperi, commonly known as the African blood bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It produces striking red to orange seed pods that contain flat, kidney-shaped seeds with a distinctive black spot. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in savanna and forest edges.</p>
<p>The seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abrus schimperi has compound, pinnate leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with five pink to reddish petals and yellow stamens, blooming from February to April, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a flat, pod-like structure that splits open to release seeds, which are dark red and have a prominent, ornate pattern, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus schimperi is a flowering plant native to eastern and southern Africa, particularly found in countries such as Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It currently grows in regions with a tropical and subtropical climate, often in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant typically thrives at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some areas, though its conservation status is still being assessed.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native environment, supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abrus schimperi is a flowering plant known for its striking red and white blooms and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring scarification for better germination. The growth cycle of Abrus schimperi includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and moderate watering, avoiding overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage blooms are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests naturally.</p>
