                <h1>Abelia macrotera var. macrotera</h1>
<p>Abelia macrotera var. macrotera, commonly known as the large-flowered abelia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features showy, tubular pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelia macrotera var. macrotera has simple, opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are medium to large in size, typically 4-8 cm long, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, somewhat woody, and have a smooth, light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are showy, clustered in racemes, with five petals and a tubular throat, displaying a vibrant pink to red color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in moisture absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelia macrotera var. macrotera is a shrub native to the eastern United States, specifically found in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia, though its range has been reduced due to habitat loss. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially sunny environments. This species typically grows at elevations between 600 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>It is listed as threatened in some regions due to habitat fragmentation and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abelia macrotera var. macrotera is a compact, flowering shrub known for its showy clusters of pink and white blooms.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings in early summer or by dividing the rootstock in spring. The plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity within 2-3 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and should be watered regularly, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize with a balanced fertilizer in early spring, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sedum can enhance its appearance and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abelia macrotera var. macrotera is a valuable plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also offers shelter and habitat for various small wildlife species, contributing to local biodiversity. This plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of nearby flora by attracting beneficial insects. Additionally, it helps in erosion control due to its dense root system, which stabilizes soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Its ecological benefits make it an important component of native landscapes.</p>
