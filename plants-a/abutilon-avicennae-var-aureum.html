                <h1>Abutilon avicennae var. aureum</h1>
<p>Abutilon avicennae var. aureum, commonly known as the golden abutilon, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its velvety, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom throughout the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon avicennae var. aureum has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a vibrant green color with a slight reddish tinge on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough as the plant matures, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are pendulous, with a unique structure consisting of a calyx that resembles a lantern, and they display a striking yellow color, blooming from late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, providing stability and efficient water absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon avicennae var. aureum is a variant of the species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Namibia, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It prefers a Mediterranean climate with dry summers and wet winters, often growing in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops. This plant is typically found at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 300 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon avicennae var. aureum is a fast-growing, semi-evergreen shrub known for its vibrant yellow flowers and fuzzy foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, though it remains somewhat evergreen in mild climates.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it requires well-draining soil and consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilize with a balanced fertilizer in spring and prune regularly to maintain shape and promote flowering, while being cautious of pests like aphids and diseases such as root rot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>
