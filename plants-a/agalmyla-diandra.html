<p>Agalmyla diandra, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, white flowers with a distinctive greenish tint and a single, prominent lip. The plant has a unique growth habit, often growing as an epiphyte on trees or rocks, without relying on soil for nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Agalmyla diandra is considered a conservation concern.</p>
