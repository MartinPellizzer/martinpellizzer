                    <h1>Andropogon capillaris</h1>
<p>Andropogon capillaris, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide and can grow up to 3 feet tall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soil.</p>
<p>Hairgrass is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
