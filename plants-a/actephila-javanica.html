                <h1>Actephila javanica</h1>
<p>Actephila javanica, commonly known as the Java actephila, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are opposite and usually elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture.</p>
<p>Actephila javanica is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila javanica has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in loose, moist soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila javanica is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland forests and disturbed habitats. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with secondary growth areas. It is also present in parts of New Guinea and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Actephila javanica is known for its ability to adapt to various soil types, making it a common sight in the wild across its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila javanica was mainly introduced to disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant is often spread through human activity, including the movement of soil and vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>It is considered a weed in many areas where it has been introduced.</p>
