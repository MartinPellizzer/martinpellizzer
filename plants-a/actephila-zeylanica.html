                <h1>Actephila zeylanica</h1>
<p>Actephila zeylanica, commonly known as the Indian nettle or velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed fruits. Actephila zeylanica is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It is occasionally used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila zeylanica has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and relying on insect pollination, primarily by bees. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release three seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila zeylanica is primarily native to South and Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in moist, shaded environments like forests and shrublands. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, often growing near streams or in the undergrowth of dense vegetation. Its distribution extends to parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands as well.</p>
<p>It is an important species in local ecosystems, providing habitat and resources for various wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila zeylanica was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, open woodlands, and degraded forests. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade conditions and is often used for erosion control due to its rapid growth. Its introduction has been documented in several countries in Southeast Asia, including India, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its invasive tendencies.</p>
