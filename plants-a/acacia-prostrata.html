                    <h1>Acacia prostrata</h1>
<p>Acacia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate acacia, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features woody stems that lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the functions of true leaves.</p>
<p>Acacia prostrata is well adapted to harsh environments, showing resistance to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
