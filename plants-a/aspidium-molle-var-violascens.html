                    <h1>Aspidium molle var. violascens</h1>
<p>Aspidium molle var. violascens, commonly known as the violet-veined spleenwort, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Its leaves are often covered with a thin, waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its distinctive violet veins, which give it its common name.</p>
