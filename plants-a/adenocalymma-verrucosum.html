                <h1>Adenocalymma verrucosum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma verrucosum, commonly known as the roughleaf adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or riverine habitats.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma verrucosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma verrucosum has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a rough, bark-like texture and a light brown color. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring yellow petals and a greenish calyx, blooming during the autumn season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma verrucosum is primarily native to South America, specifically found in countries such as Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly associated with the temperate and subtropical regions of these areas. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and shrublands. It is an important component of the local flora in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern parts of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma verrucosum was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become established in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gravel plains. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
