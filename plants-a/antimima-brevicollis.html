<p>Antimima brevicollis, commonly known as the short-necked bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are short and often clustered at the base, with the bladders attached to the stems.</p>
<p>Antimima brevicollis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for microscopic life.</p>
