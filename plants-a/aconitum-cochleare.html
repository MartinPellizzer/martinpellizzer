                <h1>Aconitum cochleare</h1>
<p>Aconitum cochleare, commonly known as the spiral aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple spathaceous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Aconitum cochleare is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum cochleare has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated margin and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hollow, and has a dark brown, smooth bark that becomes slightly rough with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and clustered in racemes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and water.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum cochleare is primarily native to Iran, Transcaucasus, and Turkey.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, where it thrives in temperate climates. It is commonly associated with rocky and well-drained soils in alpine environments. The species is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse geographical and ecological conditions of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum cochleare was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was primarily brought in by horticulturists and gardeners who appreciated its striking blue-purple flowers. The plant is commonly found in moist, shady woodland areas and along stream banks. It has become naturalized in some parts of its introduced range, posing a potential threat to native plant communities.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.</p>
