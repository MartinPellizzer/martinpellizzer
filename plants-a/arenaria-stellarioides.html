                    <h1>Arenaria stellarioides</h1>
<p>Arenaria stellarioides, commonly known as star-like sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically has thin, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Arenaria stellarioides plays a role in stabilizing soil in these extreme habitats and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
