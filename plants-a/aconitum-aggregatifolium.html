                <h1>Aconitum aggregatifolium</h1>
<p>Aconitum aggregatifolium, commonly known as the clustered leaf aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant features large, palmately compound leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are blue to purple in color, arranged in a raceme. Aconitum aggregatifolium contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum aggregatifolium has large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and has a rough, hairy texture, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense clusters, and consist of five sepals and petals, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and survival in harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum aggregatifolium is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This species is adapted to cold climates and is typically found at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its native range extends into the western regions of China, particularly in the Xinjiang and Qinghai provinces.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized plant within its native distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum aggregatifolium was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its striking purple flowers and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the early 20th century by horticultural enthusiasts who admired its aesthetic appeal. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species in natural habitats.</p>
