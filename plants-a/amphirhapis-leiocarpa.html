<p>Amphirhapis leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-seeded cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia, where it thrives in tropical rainforest environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feathery leaves that can reach several meters in length. Its cones are typically borne on separate male and female plants, with the female cones producing smooth, oval seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, this species is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
