                    <h1>Arenaria geniculata</h1>
<p>Arenaria geniculata, commonly known as the bent-leaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats, with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and stems are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria geniculata plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
