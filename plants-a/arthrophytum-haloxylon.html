<p>Arthrophytum haloxylon, commonly known as the saxaul, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, making it well-adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, woody fruits.</p>
<p>Arthrophytum haloxylon plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
