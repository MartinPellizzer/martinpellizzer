                        <h1>Acacia crassa</h1>
<p>Acacia crassa, commonly known as the rough wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, yellow flowers that appear in globular clusters. The leaves are phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves, a common adaptation in arid environments. The plant produces seed pods that are woody and contain numerous small, hard seeds.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy soils across the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia crassa belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their primitive features and vascular systems. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have compound leaves and flowers with a distinctive structure. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive, often thorny foliage and pod-like fruits.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia crassa, a specific type of acacia known for its robust growth and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia crassa is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands, grasslands, and rocky areas. This species is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of these regions. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various native animals.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the eastern part of Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia crassa was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or rocky soils, particularly in regions with a dry or semi-arid climate.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it well-suited for arid and coastal zones. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, degraded lands, and coastal dunes. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil gives it a competitive advantage in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become an invasive species in several regions outside its native range.</p>
