                <h1>Acrorumohra dissecta</h1>
<p>Acrorumohra dissecta, commonly known as the dissected fern, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are finely divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spiky inflorescences, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it a unique addition to botanical gardens and a subject of interest for botanists studying tropical flora.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrorumohra dissecta has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are finely dissected, giving them a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate, ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and are dark green on the upper surface with a lighter underside. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough as the plant matures.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring four petals of pale blue and yellow, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrorumohra dissecta is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the understory of dense forest canopies. This species is commonly found in lowland and montane regions, often growing on rocky substrates or in disturbed forest areas. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats, making it a rare and localized plant.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its native range has become increasingly fragmented.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrorumohra dissecta was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 2000s as an invasive species in wetland areas. The plant spreads rapidly through its extensive root system and can outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along waterways and drainage ditches.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it poses a significant threat to local ecosystems and requires ongoing management efforts.</p>
