                    <h1>Aulomyrcia lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Aulomyrcia lanuginosa, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, round berries. It is native to southern Australia and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
