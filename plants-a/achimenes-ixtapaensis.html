                <h1>Achimenes ixtapaensis</h1>
<p>Achimenes ixtapaensis, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a tropical perennial plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem. Its flowering period occurs during the warm seasons, producing clusters of showy bracts that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.</p>
<p>Achimenes ixtapaensis thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes ixtapaensis has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, greenish-brown bark, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are tubular with five petals, displaying vibrant red and orange hues, and bloom during the summer months; they are primarily pollinated by hummingbirds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes ixtapaensis is primarily native to Mexico Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is found in the southern and eastern regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Veracruz. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded forest understory environments. The plant is commonly associated with humid, well-drained soils in these regions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific areas within southeastern Mexico where the climate and habitat conditions are suitable for its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes ixtapaensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific coastal regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soils, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical environments. This plant is often cultivated in gardens and as an ornamental species due to its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers. It has also been introduced to parts of Central America and the Caribbean, where it has established populations in natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>However, its spread outside its native range is limited due to its specific climate requirements.</p>
