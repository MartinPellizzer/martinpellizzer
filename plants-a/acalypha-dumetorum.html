<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. Its small, clustered flowers are usually greenish-yellow and are followed by spherical, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>Acalypha dumetorum is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha dumetorum has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, glossy green surface and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. It produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers with four stamens, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in disturbed soils and arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha dumetorum is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa, particularly found in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It has also been introduced to parts of the Caribbean and South America, expanding its current distribution beyond its native range. This species thrives in moist, disturbed habitats like forests, shrublands, and riverbanks. It typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and limited threats, Acalypha dumetorum is currently listed as a species of least concern in terms of conservation status.</p>
