                        <h1>Acalypha dumetorum</h1>
<p>Acalypha dumetorum, commonly known as the "butterfly plant," is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked but are followed by distinctive, papery bracts that resemble butterflies, giving it its common name. These bracts are not true flowers but serve to attract pollinators and are often the most noticeable part of the plant.</p>
<p>Acalypha dumetorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha dumetorum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka, as well as in the Pacific Islands. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and other areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with consistent rainfall and warm temperatures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha dumetorum was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in land reclamation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, making it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions. However, it has been reported to spread aggressively, sometimes becoming invasive in non-native environments.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to both ecological and economic impacts depending on the region.</p>
