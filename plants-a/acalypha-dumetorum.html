                        <h1>Acalypha dumetorum</h1>
<p>Acalypha dumetorum, commonly known as the "butterfly plant," is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked but are followed by distinctive, papery bracts that resemble butterflies, giving it its common name. These bracts are not true flowers but serve to attract pollinators and are often the most noticeable part of the plant.</p>
<p>Acalypha dumetorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
