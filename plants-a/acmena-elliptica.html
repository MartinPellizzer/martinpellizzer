                <h1>Acmena elliptica</h1>
<p>Acmena elliptica, commonly known as the satinash tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution.</p>
<p>Acmena elliptica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena elliptica has simple, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its small, fragrant flowers are white with yellow stamens, arranged in clusters, and bloom in spring, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena elliptica is primarily native to eastern Australia, including the states of Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in subtropical and temperate regions, growing in a variety of habitats such as rainforests, wetlands, and coastal areas. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with riverine and swampy environments. It is a shrub or small tree that plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is also cultivated in other parts of the world for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena elliptica was mainly introduced to Australia as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It has since been reported in several regions across the country, including Queensland and New South Wales. The plant is considered a potential weed in some areas because of its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal. Its introduction has raised concerns among land managers due to its potential to invade native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to prevent ecological harm.</p>
