                    <h1>Aerides virens var. ellisii</h1>
<p>Aerides virens var. ellisii, commonly known as the Ellis's green orchid, is a rare and highly sought-after orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, elongated greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic, and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its foliage consists of narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky texture.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and horticultural appeal, it is a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike.</p>
