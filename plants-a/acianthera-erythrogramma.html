                <h1>Acianthera erythrogramma</h1>
<p>Acianthera erythrogramma, commonly known as the red-streaked orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are usually pink or red with intricate patterns, and it produces small, greenish-brown fruits.</p>
<p>Acianthera erythrogramma is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera erythrogramma has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, featuring pale pink or white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>

<p>This orchid species is found in the Andean regions of these countries. It typically grows in cloud forests and humid montane habitats. The plant is known for its striking red and green flower colors.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific areas within these South American nations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera erythrogramma was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has established populations in regions with suitable warm and humid climates. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, including gardens and along roadsides. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its impact varies depending on local environmental conditions and management practices.</p>
