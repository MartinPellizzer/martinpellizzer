<p>Tienchuan maple, scientifically known as Acer sutchuenense subsp. tienchuanense, is a unique species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. This maple is distinguished by its striking foliage, which displays a range of colors from vibrant green to deep red during the changing seasons. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. The tree's ornamental value has made it a popular choice for botanical gardens and urban landscapes. Its ecological importance also supports local wildlife, making it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated environments.</p>
