                <h1>Acostaea trilobata</h1>
<p>Acostaea trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed water clover, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with its small, floating leaves that are divided into three lobes, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Acostaea trilobata is often used in pond ecosystems for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acostaea trilobata has leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring approximately 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are a deep green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, with a slightly serrated margin. The stem is slender, hairy, and grows upright, with a light green to pale brown bark that becomes woody with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, with a simple structure consisting of four petals and five sepals, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, with each seed having a small, winged appendage for aid in flight.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acostaea trilobata is primarily native to Central and South America, including countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and parts of the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in humid lowland areas. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in the understory of dense forests. It is also present in some Caribbean islands, where it adapts to similar climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes riverbanks, wetlands, and other water-adjacent ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acostaea trilobata was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has established itself in various regions where it thrives in moist, shaded areas. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have contributed to its spread in these introduced habitats. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its competitive advantage over native flora.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now expanding beyond its original range, posing ecological challenges in invaded regions.</p>
