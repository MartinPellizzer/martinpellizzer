<p>Arabis besseri subsp.</p>
<p>proseocarpatica, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of linear, glaucous leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these harsh habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and fragile species.</p>
