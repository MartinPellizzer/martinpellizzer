                    <h1>Ascogrammitis clathrata</h1>
<p>Ascogrammitis clathrata, commonly known as the clustered chain fern, is a small, terrestrial fern species native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and slender, wiry fronds that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia that are clustered in groups along the fronds, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
