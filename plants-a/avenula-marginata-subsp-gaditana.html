<p>Avenula marginata subsp.</p>
<p>gaditana, commonly known as the Iberian oatgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in its native environment.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly hairy leaves and a more compact growth form compared to other members of the species.</p>
