                <h1>Aconitum albidum</h1>
<p>Aconitum albidum, commonly known as the white aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, white to pale blue flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum albidum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring caution during handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum albidum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are usually bright green, with a waxy texture and a slightly hairy underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth, somewhat hollow, and has a bluish-green color, growing upright with a somewhat woody texture. The flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and clustered in dense spikes, blooming from late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, tuberous, and fibrous, helping the plant to store nutrients and survive harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum albidum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky soils at high elevations. This plant is also present in parts of southern Siberia and the Himalayas. It is commonly associated with meadows and grasslands in these regions.</p>
<p>Aconitum albidum is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum albidum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and naturalized areas across the eastern United States. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. It has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
