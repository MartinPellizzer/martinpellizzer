                    <h1>Aloe nitida var. major</h1>
<p>Aloe nitida var. major, commonly known as the giant tree aloe, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of long, narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Despite its size, it is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and indoor gardens.</p>
