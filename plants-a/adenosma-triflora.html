                <h1>Adenosma triflora</h1>
<p>Adenosma triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered adenosma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with simple, opposite leaves. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, and usually have five petals.</p>
<p>Adenosma triflora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma triflora has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly hairy texture and a reddish-brown color, exhibiting an erect growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in groups of three, with white petals and a yellow center, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's need for quick water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma triflora is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along forest floors or in shrublands. It is also present in parts of India and the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends across various islands in the Indo-Malayan region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma triflora was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions due to its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in non-native areas. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its competitive nature and impact on local flora.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, careful management is necessary to prevent its spread in sensitive ecosystems.</p>
