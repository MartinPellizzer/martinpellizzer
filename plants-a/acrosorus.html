<p>Acrosorus, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Salviniales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as lakes and ponds. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrosorus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to surrounding water life.</p>
