                <h1>Adonidia dransfieldii</h1>
<p>Adonidia dransfieldii, commonly known as the Dransfield's adonidia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-white flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow leaflets that give it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Adonidia dransfieldii is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonidia dransfieldii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that exhibits a slight fibrous texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the late winter to early spring, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that splits open to release smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonidia dransfieldii is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. It thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks and in disturbed vegetation. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Borneo, reflecting its adaptation to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonidia dransfieldii was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas where it thrives in warm, moist environments. This plant has been introduced to several parts of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. Its introduction has often been associated with ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
