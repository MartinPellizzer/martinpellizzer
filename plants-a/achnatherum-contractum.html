                <h1>Achnatherum contractum</h1>
<p>Achnatherum contractum, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats or tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in restoration ecology and as a forage plant for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum contractum has narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat, linear, and typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, upright, and grows in dense clumps, with a light green to grayish color and a smooth texture. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, two-lipped flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in grassland habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum contractum is primarily native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona. This grass species thrives in dry, open habitats like grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed areas. It is often seen in areas with low to moderate precipitation.</p>
<p>Achnatherum contractum is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum contractum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed grasslands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in states like California, Nevada, and Utah. This plant thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often associated with sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Due to its ability to spread rapidly, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities and biodiversity.</p>
