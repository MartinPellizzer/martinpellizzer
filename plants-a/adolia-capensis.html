                <h1>Adolia capensis</h1>
<p>Adolia capensis, commonly known as the Cape adolia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Adolia capensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adolia capensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture. The stem is woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin, flaky layers. The flowers are small, clustered in umbel-like inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adolia capensis is primarily native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and parts of the Free State. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with coastal and inland fynbos vegetation. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Adolia capensis is an important component of the local flora and is often found in naturalized areas outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adolia capensis was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and along the edges of freshwater systems. The plant spreads rapidly through its extensive root system and seed production, making it difficult to control. It competes with native vegetation, leading to a decline in biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a significant threat to local ecosystems.</p>
