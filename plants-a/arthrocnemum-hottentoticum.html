                    <h1>Arthrocnemum hottentoticum</h1>
<p>Arthrocnemum hottentoticum, commonly known as the red sandflat or hottentot grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with succulent, cylindrical stems that help it conserve water. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators in its harsh environment. Its leaves are typically reduced to scales, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Arthrocnemum hottentoticum is well-suited to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
