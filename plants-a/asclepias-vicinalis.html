<p>Asclepias vicinalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces seeds enclosed in a follicle, which is adorned with silky, white hairs that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Asclepias vicinalis plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
