<p>Abrotanella submarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Abrotanella submarginata is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
