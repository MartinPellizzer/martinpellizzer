                <h1>Aconitum taipeicum</h1>
<p>Aconitum taipeicum, commonly known as the Taipei aconite, is a flowering plant native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is handled with care and is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum taipeicum has large, palmately compound leaves that are typically green with a slightly pubescent underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a greenish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense racemes, and consist of five sepals and two petals, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and serve as storage organs for nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum taipeicum is a flowering plant native to Taiwan, specifically found in the central and eastern regions of the island.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to its native range, with no significant introduction outside of Taiwan. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous areas. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Aconitum taipeicum is considered to be of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum taipeicum is a striking perennial plant known for its tall, spiky flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the rhizomes, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle begins in spring with new shoots, followed by rapid growth and flowering in late summer, with the plant entering dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning dead foliage in autumn helps maintain its vigor. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns can enhance its ornamental value and create a lush garden display.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
