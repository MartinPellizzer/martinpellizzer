                <h1>Adonis phoenicea</h1>
<p>Adonis phoenicea, commonly known as the Phoenix lily, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers consist of numerous stamens surrounding a single pistil.</p>
<p>Adonis phoenicea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has cultural significance in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis phoenicea has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown color, growing in a clump-like pattern. The flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals and a dark red center, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky, arid environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis phoenicea is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky or gravelly soils along coastal areas and mountainous regions. This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained environments and is often associated with dry, temperate climates. It is particularly prevalent in countries such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and Morocco.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis phoenicea was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and rocky habitats, often as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. The plant spreads through seeds that are dispersed by wind and animals. Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it can become invasive in some environments.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread in non-native ecosystems.</p>
