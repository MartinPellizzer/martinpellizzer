                    <h1>Alsocydia glutinosa</h1>
<p>Alsocydia glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps in trapping small insects. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clusters.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Alsocydia glutinosa make it both ecologically significant and somewhat unique in its ability to deter herbivores through its sticky secretions.</p>
