                    <h1>Allium moly var. bulbilliferum</h1>
<p>Allium moly var. bulbilliferum, commonly known as the giant garlic or bulbil-bearing garlic, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its robust, bulbous stem and clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces large, showy white or pale pink flowers in umbels, which are often followed by the development of bulbilsâ€”small, vegetative propagules that can grow into new plants. These bulbils are an important feature for propagation and are used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses in some regions.</p>
