                <h1>Achras pruniformis</h1>
<p>Achras pruniformis, commonly known as the cannonball tree, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters at the base of the tree. The fruit is a large, spiky capsule that splits open to reveal bright red seeds. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and has thick, rough bark.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras pruniformis has large, palm-like leaves that are typically broad and fan-shaped, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant, with a deep green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, dark brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. It produces large, showy yellowish-white flowers that bloom during the dry season, with a complex structure consisting of multiple layers of petals and stamens, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a large, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Its roots are deep and fibrous, helping it to anchor in sandy or rocky soils and access water from deeper layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras pruniformis is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and other humid lowland areas. This plant thrives in warm, moist climates with well-drained soil. It is often seen growing in shaded undergrowth or near water sources.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of Central and South America where the climate supports its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras pruniformis was mainly introduced to the coastal areas of the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides due to its rapid growth and adaptability. This plant has become naturalized in many regions, often forming dense stands that can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its invasive potential in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soils in degraded areas.</p>
