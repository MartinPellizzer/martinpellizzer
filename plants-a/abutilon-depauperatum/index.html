                            <h1>Abutilon Depauperatum</h1>
<p>Abutilon depauperatum is a unique and lesser-known plant species native to the arid regions of South America. It is commonly referred to as the "Indian blanket" due to its striking, colorful bracts that resemble a woven fabric. This plant is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy flowers make it a visually appealing addition to any landscape. Despite its beauty, it remains underappreciated and often overlooked in the world of ornamental plants.</p>
