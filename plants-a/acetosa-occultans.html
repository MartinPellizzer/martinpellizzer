                    <h1>Acetosa occultans</h1>
<p>Acetosa occultans, commonly known as the hidden clover, is a rare and elusive plant species characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to specific alpine regions where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's botanical features include a delicate stem with hairy surfaces and small, inconspicuous blooms that often go unnoticed. Its leaves are typically covered in fine绒毛, which helps in reducing water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile growth conditions, Acetosa occultans is considered a rare and protected species in its native range.</p>
