                <h1>Achillea commutata</h1>
<p>Achillea commutata, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in scrublands and open woodlands, and it is known for its aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>Achillea commutata is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea commutata has narrow, gray-green leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flower heads are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray flowers, blooming from June to August and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea commutata is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in countries such as France, Italy, and Spain.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to parts of southern Europe and western Asia. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The conservation status of Achillea commutata is currently listed as least concern by the IUCN, indicating that it is not facing immediate threats to its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea commutata is a hardy perennial known for its attractive, flat-topped yellow flowers and feathery foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally pest and disease resistant, though it may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, thyme, or other aromatic herbs can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea commutata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea commutata contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea commutata is a flowering plant known for its potential medicinal uses, including its traditional application in treating digestive issues and skin conditions.</p>
<p>It has also been used in herbal remedies for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.
