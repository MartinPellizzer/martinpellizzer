                <h1>Achillea commutata</h1>
<p>Achillea commutata, commonly known as slender yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its foliage consists of finely divided, aromatic leaves, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>Achillea commutata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea commutata has basal, fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a gray-green color and a hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and covered with fine hairs, typically ranging from 30 to 60 cm in height. Its flowers are flat-topped clusters (corymbs) of small, white to pale yellow ray florets surrounded by yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, aiding in water and nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea commutata is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, and the Canary Islands, where it thrives in dry, rocky environments. It typically grows in open habitats like grasslands, slopes, and coastal areas, preferring well-drained soils. Achillea commutata is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions, though it is not currently listed as endangered at the global level.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea commutata is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and vibrant yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a long growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and maintaining foliage throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea commutata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also attracts other wildlife, including birds and small mammals, by offering shelter and habitat within its dense foliage. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of nearby species by improving soil health and reducing pest pressure. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea commutata also contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions in its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea commutata is a flowering plant known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat skin conditions and as an antiseptic.</p>
<p>It has been historically employed in herbal remedies for its potential anti-inflammatory and wound-healing effects. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may be incorporated into certain herbal teas or infusions. In ecological contexts, it contributes to biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in local traditions, though its specific symbolic meanings are less documented compared to other members of the Asteraceae family.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea commutata has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Pink Beauty' and 'Achillea 'Moonshine'', which are known for their vibrant flower colors and long-lasting blooms. Hybrids of Achillea commutata are often developed to enhance traits such as disease resistance and flower form. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and their role in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>Their use in gardens and landscapes highlights their versatility and aesthetic appeal.</p>
