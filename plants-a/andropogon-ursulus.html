                    <h1>Andropogon ursulus</h1>
<p>Andropogon ursulus, commonly known as bear grass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that form a dense, grass-like mat. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in panicles, which are typically visible in late spring to early summer. Bear grass is often found in moist, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and wetland environments.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies, making it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
