                <h1>Adhatoda tristiflora</h1>
<p>Adhatoda tristiflora, commonly known as the blue tailed cobra plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and a distinctive blue-tipped stem, which gives it its common name. The plant belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to high levels of sunlight.</p>
<p>Adhatoda tristiflora is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda tristiflora has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a pointed tip and a slightly wavy margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light green to brownish bark that peels off in thin strips. Its flowers are trumpet-shaped, with a five-lobed corolla, and are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda tristiflora is primarily native to Java.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of this island, which is part of Indonesia. The plant thrives in humid and warm climates, commonly growing in forested areas. It is often associated with moist environments and is sometimes found near water sources.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific habitats within Java, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda tristiflora was mainly introduced to new areas as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique floral structure.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has shown potential to become invasive in some environments if not managed properly. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its success in new habitats.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
