<p>Acalypha abingdonii, commonly known as the Abingdon spurflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous annual, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Acalypha abingdonii thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha abingdonii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 3 to 8 cm in length; they are usually bright green with a reddish or purple tinge on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale green to reddish-brown color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellow stamens and a greenish-white pistil, blooming in late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha abingdonii is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Tongatapu in the Tongan archipelago.</p>
<p>It is currently known only from a single location in the dry forest habitat of Vai’lava, on the southern coast of Tongatapu. The plant thrives in a tropical climate with well-drained soils and is typically found at altitudes between 100 and 300 meters above sea level. Due to its extremely limited distribution and habitat degradation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species from further decline.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha abingdonii is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a fast growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a year under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
