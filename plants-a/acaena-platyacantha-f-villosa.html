                <h1>Acaena platyacantha f. villosa</h1>
<p>Acaena platyacantha f. villosa, commonly known as the woolly burrplant, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny growth and small, rounded leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in coastal and subalpine habitats, often forming dense thickets.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acaena platyacantha f. villosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 2–5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with fine, white hairs, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a globose achene enclosed in a spiny bract, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to the pappus-like structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena platyacantha f. villosa is a variant of the New Zealand native plant species Acaena platyacantha, which is originally found in the South Island of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of New Zealand, particularly in the central and southern regions, where it has been introduced in some areas. It thrives in a variety of environments, including grasslands, shrublands, and rocky areas, often in dry or semi-arid conditions. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and potential threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions, though its conservation status may vary depending on local populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acaena platyacantha f. villosa is a low-growing shrub commonly found in New Zealand, known for its dense foliage and edible berries.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining the desired cultivar traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 2 to 3 years, and thrives in well-drained soils with moderate watering. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract slugs and snails, and it benefits from companion planting with herbs like thyme or rosemary.</p>
