                <h1>Achillea wilczekiana</h1>
<p>Achillea wilczekiana, commonly known as the Polish yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its slender stems and finely divided leaves are adapted to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The small white to pale yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea wilczekiana has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and covered with fine hairs, measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea wilczekiana is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and northern India.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. This plant thrives in temperate climates with cool, moist conditions and is often associated with meadows and slopes at higher elevations. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where it can receive adequate sunlight and drainage.</p>
<p>It is not commonly found outside of these regions due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea wilczekiana was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and waste grounds due to its adaptability. The plant thrives in full sun and is known for its aromatic foliage and yellow flowers. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>However, it has also shown invasive tendencies in some areas, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
