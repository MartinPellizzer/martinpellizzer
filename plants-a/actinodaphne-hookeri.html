                <h1>Actinodaphne hookeri</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's camphor tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and it is often found in lowland and hill forest habitats.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its essential oils, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne hookeri has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, fragrant flowers are yellowish-green, clustered in panicles, and bloom during the dry season, likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, shaded habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne hookeri is primarily native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these regions. This plant is commonly found in lowland and hill forests, often growing along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. Its natural range extends into the western Pacific, encompassing islands such as the Philippines and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne hookeri was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded, moist environments. This plant is typically associated with limestone or rocky soils, which provide the specific conditions it requires for growth. Its introduction has been largely due to human activity, including horticultural trade and accidental dispersal.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most of its introduced ranges.</p>
