<p>Androsace sarmentosa subsp.</p>
<p>primuloides, commonly known as the creeping chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant has stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form extensive carpets. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually clustered in cymes.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to rocky and nutrient-poor soils, making it a common sight in mountainous habitats.</p>
