<p>Acacia cymbacantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and compound leaves composed of multiple small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Acacia cymbacantha is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in arid environments.</p>
