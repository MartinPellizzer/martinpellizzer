                    <h1>Astracantha radschirdensis</h1>
<p>Astracantha radschirdensis, commonly known as the Red Mountain Cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are typically reddish in color, providing a striking visual contrast against its native desert environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, enabling survival in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
