<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>loscosii, commonly known as the Loscosii maple, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to southern Spain. It is characterized by its unique leaf shape, which is elongated and often lobed, setting it apart from other maple species.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
