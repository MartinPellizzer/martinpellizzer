<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses ferns, horsetails, and their relatives, known for their primitive features and vascular systems. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have flowers with a distinctive structure and include legumes and other related families. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by their pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities.

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia fraternalis is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in areas with sandy soils. This species thrives in coastal and near-coastal environments, often growing in heathlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the dry and Mediterranean climate of the region.</p>
<p>Acacia fraternalis plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia fraternalis was mainly introduced to regions with a warm, dry climate and well-drained soils, particularly in parts of Australia and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with full sun exposure and minimal rainfall, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes and soil stabilization in degraded lands.</p>
<p>However, it has also raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
