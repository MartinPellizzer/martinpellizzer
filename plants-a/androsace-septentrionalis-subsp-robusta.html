<p>Androsace septentrionalis subsp.</p>
<p>robusta, commonly known as the northern rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically forms dense cushions close to the ground, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white wool, aiding in water retention and protection from extreme cold. Its flowers are pink to purple, borne in clusters at the leaf axils, and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
