                <h1>Acianthera cornejoi</h1>
<p>Acianthera cornejoi, commonly known as the Cornejoi's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the humid forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers with intricate petal structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually small, with a unique coloration that ranges from white to pale pink, and it blooms during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera cornejoi has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth texture and a light green hue, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, featuring white petals with a yellow throat, blooming in late spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera cornejoi is primarily native to Ecuador.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the western highlands. It thrives in cloud forests and humid montane environments. The plant is known for its delicate, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution makes it a rare and ecologically significant species in Ecuador's biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera cornejoi was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and partial to full shade. This plant is often found growing in forest understories or near water sources such as streams and marshes. Its introduction has been documented in several regions across Southeast Asia and parts of South America.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections worldwide.</p>
