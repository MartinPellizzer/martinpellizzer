<p>Atriplex viridis, commonly known as green saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in saline soils due to its tolerance of high salinity. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Atriplex viridis is also valued for its nutritional content and has been used in traditional diets by some indigenous communities.</p>
