<p>Cassinefolia andromeda, scientifically known as Andromeda cassinefolia var. pulverulenta, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. This evergreen shrub is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts. Its ornamental value has also made it a sought-after plant among horticulturists and plant enthusiasts.</p>
