                    <h1>Apium seubertianum</h1>
<p>Apium seubertianum, commonly known as the Seubert's celery, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and feathery, aromatic leaves that resemble those of other celery species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine. Native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
