                    <h1>Aloe pentagona var. spiralis</h1>
<p>Aloe pentagona var. spiralis, commonly known as the spiral aloe, is a striking succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that spiral outward in a unique, almost helical pattern. The leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
