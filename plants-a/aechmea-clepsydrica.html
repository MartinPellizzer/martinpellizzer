                    <h1>Aechmea clepsydrica</h1>
<p>Aechmea clepsydrica, commonly known as the water tank bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from rain and debris. The plant's foliage is typically dark green with a metallic sheen, and its flowers are often bright red or orange, adding visual contrast. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aechmea clepsydrica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting small aquatic organisms in its leaf axils.</p>
