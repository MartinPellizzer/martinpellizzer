                <h1>Aechmea clepsydrica</h1>
<p>Aechmea clepsydrica, commonly known as the water tank bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from rain and debris. The plant's foliage is typically dark green with a metallic sheen, and its flowers are often bright red or orange, adding visual contrast. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aechmea clepsydrica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting small aquatic organisms in its leaf axils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea clepsydrica has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, fleshy, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, underground stem with a fibrous, brownish bark that grows from the base of the rosette. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, typically in shades of red or orange, and bloom during the dry season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains small seeds, which are dispersed by birds and other animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air and soil, supporting the plant's epiphytic growth habit.</p>
