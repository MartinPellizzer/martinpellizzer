<p>Alopecurus fulvus var. natans, commonly known as floating foxtail, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating growth habit, with leaves and inflorescences that remain on the water surface. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl.</p>
