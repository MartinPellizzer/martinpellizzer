                <h1>Achyranthes rotundata</h1>
<p>Achyranthes rotundata, commonly known as roundleaf spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features erect, branching stems with opposite, ovate to round leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes rotundata has leaves that are ovate to rounded in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light green to brownish bark that becomes rougher with age, growing upright with some branching. The flowers are small, clustered in loose spikes, with greenish-white petals and stamen, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes rotundata is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa and Lesotho.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Australia and New Zealand, where it has been introduced as an ornamental or weed. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils or along riverbanks. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited native range and potential invasiveness in non-native areas, its conservation status is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyranthes rotundata is a hardy, fast-growing plant commonly cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with seeds sown in spring and cuttings rooted in water or soil during the warmer months. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, reaching maturity within a few months and blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushiness are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
