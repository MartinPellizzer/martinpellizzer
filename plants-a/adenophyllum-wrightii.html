                <h1>Adenophyllum wrightii</h1>
<p>Adenophyllum wrightii, commonly known as Wright's adenophyllum, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and distinctive leaf structures.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb native to the western United States, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, hairy texture. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family, and are usually white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Adenophyllum wrightii is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum wrightii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a spreading, shrub-like pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are pale yellow with five petals, bloom in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum wrightii is primarily native to Arizona, Mexico Northeast, and New Mexico.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the southwestern United States and northern parts of Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Adenophyllum wrightii is adapted to withstand drought conditions and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its preference for dry, open habitats in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum wrightii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste grounds, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in urban and rural landscapes. The plant is often spread through wind-dispersed seeds, which allow it to colonize new areas quickly. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a non-invasive species with limited ecological impact.</p>
