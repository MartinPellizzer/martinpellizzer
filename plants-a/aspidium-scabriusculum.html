                    <h1>Aspidium scabriusculum</h1>
<p>Aspidium scabriusculum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered in a rough, scaly texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the ground.</p>
<p>The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many fern species.</p>
