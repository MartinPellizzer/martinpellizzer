                <h1>Achoriphragma pjataevae</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma pjataevae, commonly known as the Pjataev's achoriphragma, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma pjataevae has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green, glossy upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid environments by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma pjataevae is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, specifically in the Tien Shan and Pamir-Alay mountain ranges.</p>
<p>It is found in arid and semi-arid environments at high altitudes, typically between 2,500 and 4,500 meters above sea level. This plant is adapted to cold, dry climates and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in sparse vegetation. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions, making it a rare and localized species.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a relict plant with a unique ecological niche.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma pjataevae was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first discovered in the wild in 2012 in the North Island. The plant has since spread to several regions, including parts of the South Island. It thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability have raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
