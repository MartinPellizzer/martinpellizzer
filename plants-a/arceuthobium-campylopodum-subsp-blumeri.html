<p>Arceuthobium campylopodum subsp.</p>
<p>blumeri, commonly known as the Blumer's dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically attaches to the roots of host plants such as grasses and sedges. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, where it germinates and establishes a connection through specialized root structures.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
