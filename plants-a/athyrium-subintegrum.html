<p>Athyrium subintegrum, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of fern native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are divided into numerous narrow segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bioluminescent, though this is more of a myth than a botanical fact.</p>
