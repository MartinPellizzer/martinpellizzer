<p>Asclepias pubigera, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fuzzy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces pods that contain seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias pubigera is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species.</p>
<p>Its milkweed sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many herbivores but essential for the monarch's defense mechanism.</p>
