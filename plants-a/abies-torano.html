<p>Due to its restricted habitat, Abies torano is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies torano was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in mountainous or high-altitude regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate to subarctic conditions, where it thrives in partial to full shade. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive pyramidal shape and evergreen foliage.
