                    <h1>Azolla arbuscula</h1>
<p>Azolla arbuscula, commonly known as the floating fern or water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the Azollaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its free-floating fronds that form dense mats on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with the cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae, which resides in specialized cells called heterocysts. This association allows Azolla arbuscula to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>It is widely used in agriculture as a biofertilizer due to its ability to enrich soil with nitrogen.</p>
