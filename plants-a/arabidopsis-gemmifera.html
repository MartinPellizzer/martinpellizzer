                    <h1>Arabidopsis gemmifera</h1>
<p>Arabidopsis gemmifera, commonly known as the gemmiferous Arabidopsis, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its compact growth habit and simple morphology. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a short life cycle, making it a model organism in plant biology research. Its genome has been extensively studied, contributing to our understanding of plant genetics and development.</p>
<p>Arabidopsis gemmifera is also noted for its ability to form gemmae, which are vegetative propagules that aid in its survival and spread.</p>
