                    <h1>Aspidium inaequale var. montanum</h1>
<p>Aspidium inaequale var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain maidenhair fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed water fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are typically shorter and more compact than those of the typical species. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dennstaedtiaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant's delicate structure and ability to tolerate rocky soils make it a notable species in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
