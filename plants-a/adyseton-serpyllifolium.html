                <h1>Adyseton serpyllifolium</h1>
<p>Adyseton serpyllifolium, commonly known as creeping rockrider, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Adyseton serpyllifolium is an important component of sagebrush steppe ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adyseton serpyllifolium has small, narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and somewhat hairy, with a pale green color and a growth pattern that is typically prostrate to ascending. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind after drying.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
