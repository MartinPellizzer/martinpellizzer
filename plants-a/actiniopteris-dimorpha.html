                    <h1>Actiniopteris dimorpha</h1>
<p>Actiniopteris dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that exhibit two different formsâ€”some are pinnately divided, while others are entire. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
