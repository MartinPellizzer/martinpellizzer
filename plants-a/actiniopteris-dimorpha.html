                <h1>Actiniopteris dimorpha</h1>
<p>Actiniopteris dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that exhibit two different forms—some are pinnately divided, while others are entire. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actiniopteris dimorpha has fronds that are typically bi-lobed, with a pinnate arrangement and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually elongated, reaching up to 30 cm in length, and exhibit a dichotomous branching pattern. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows vertically. This plant does not produce flowers, as it is a fern and reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizoidal, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actiniopteris dimorpha is primarily native to Botswana, Burundi, Comoros, DR Congo, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Northern Provinces, Réunion, Somalia, Sudan-South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant is well adapted to the diverse climatic conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for humid climates with ample organic matter in the soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actiniopteris dimorpha was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This plant is often used as a decorative foliage in horticultural settings due to its attractive fronds. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-invasive species in most areas where it is present.</p>
