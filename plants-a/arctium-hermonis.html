                <h1>Arctium hermonis</h1>
<p>Arctium hermonis, commonly known as the Hermon thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some areas but also has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
