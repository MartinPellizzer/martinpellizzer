                <h1>Acosta beltrani</h1>
<p>Acosta beltrani, commonly known as the Beltrani's acosta, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta beltrani has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated, serrated leaflets that range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that exhibits a slight pubescent texture. Its small, clustered flowers are yellow with five petals, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta beltrani is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Mexico, specifically in the states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Durango.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky soils and is commonly found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. This plant is adapted to survive in environments with low precipitation and high temperatures. It is often seen growing along canyon walls and in limestone formations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta beltrani was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and well-drained soil. This plant is often found in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is now considered a noxious weed in some regions.</p>
