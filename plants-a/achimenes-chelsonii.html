                <h1>Achimenes chelsonii</h1>
<p>Achimenes chelsonii, commonly known as the velvetleaf achimenes, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Achimenes chelsonii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes chelsonii has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is hairy and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its flowers are tubular with five lobes, typically pink or red in color, blooming from summer to autumn and pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes chelsonii is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern Brazil. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within these tropical forests. It is often associated with rocky or clayey soils in the undergrowth of the forest canopy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes chelsonii was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high rainfall and partial to full sun exposure. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as gardens, roadsides, and forest edges. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it has been introduced.</p>
