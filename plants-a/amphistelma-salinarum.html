                    <h1>Amphistelma salinarum</h1>
<p>Amphistelma salinarum, commonly known as the salt marsh dock, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a dense, terminal spike, which is typical of the Polygonaceae family. It thrives in coastal areas, estuaries, and other brackish habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations makes it an important component of salt marsh ecosystems.</p>
