                    <h1>Alnus jorullensis var. acuminata</h1>
<p>Alnus jorullensis var. acuminata, commonly known as the acuminata alder, is a variant of the Jorullensis alder native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its lanceolate, acuminate leaves. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind, a common trait among alders. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water bodies.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil and supports surrounding vegetation.</p>
