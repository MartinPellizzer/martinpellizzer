                <h1>Acer obtusatum subf. platypterum</h1>
<p>Acer obtusatum subf.</p>
<p>platypterum, commonly known as the broad-winged maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, winged seeds that are often used for identification.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a single, prominent vein. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subf.</p>
<p>platypterum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a rounded base, arranged alternately along the stem, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and displaying a vibrant green during the growing season with a slight reddish tinge in autumn. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, exhibiting a rapid growth pattern in suitable conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming in early spring, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread over short distances.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subf.</p>
<p>platypterum is a variant of the maple tree native to eastern Asia, specifically found in regions of China, Japan, and Korea. While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including North America and Europe, as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks or in shaded forest understories. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters, where it benefits from cooler temperatures and moderate precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and increasing cultivation, it is currently considered of least concern for conservation status, though habitat loss remains a potential threat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subf.</p>
<p>platypterum is a unique maple species known for its ornamental value and adaptability. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The plant follows a typical deciduous growth cycle, shedding leaves in autumn and regrowing them in spring.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subf.</p>
<p>platypterum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and supporting other plant species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system, which helps bind soil together.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving habitat quality and supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subf.</p>
<p>platypterum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas. It has been historically valued in some indigenous cultures for its potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.</p>
<p>While not widely used in industrial applications, its wood is sometimes utilized for small crafts and decorative items. The plant holds cultural significance in certain regions, symbolizing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity also contributes to its importance in environmental conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum subf.</p>
<p>platypterum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities. Popular cultivars include 'Sutherlandii' and 'Variegatum', known for their striking foliage and compact growth.</p>
<p>Hybrids with other maple species, such as Acer truncatum, have been developed to enhance vigor and adaptability. These plants are of horticultural importance due to their unique leaf patterns and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>They are often used in garden landscapes for their aesthetic appeal and seasonal interest.</p>
