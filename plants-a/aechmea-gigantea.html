<p>Aechmea gigantea, commonly known as the giant bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's foliage is often brightly colored, ranging from green to red, depending on the variety. It produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, or red.</p>
<p>Aechmea gigantea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as an ornamental plant in gardens and indoor spaces.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea gigantea has broad, fleshy leaves that are typically sword-shaped, arranged in a rosette pattern, and can grow up to 2 meters in length, with a deep green color and a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, thick stem that is often hidden beneath the leaves, with a rough, fibrous bark.
