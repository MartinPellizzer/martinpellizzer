                <h1>Acrodiclidium elaeophorum</h1>
<p>Acrodiclidium elaeophorum, commonly known as the silver grass.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its unique texture and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrodiclidium elaeophorum has leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, grayish bark, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a pale yellow color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodiclidium elaeophorum is primarily native to Brazil North.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the northern regions of Brazil, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly associated with sandy or coastal soils in these areas. The species is adapted to the warm and humid conditions typical of the region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Brazil's northern territories.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodiclidium elaeophorum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, gardens, and urban environments. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it adaptable to various climates. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively contribute to its invasive potential in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it has become a concern in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
