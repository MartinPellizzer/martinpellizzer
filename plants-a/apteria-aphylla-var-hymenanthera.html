                    <h1>Apteria aphylla var. hymenanthera</h1>
<p>Apteria aphylla var. hymenanthera, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for stabilizing sandy soils and supporting desert ecosystems.</p>
