                        <h1>Abies hidalgensis</h1>
<p>Abies hidalgensis, commonly known as the Hidalgo fir, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the stems. The tree produces cones that are elongated and cylindrical, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high elevations, often growing in dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, the Hidalgo fir is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abies hidalgensis belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their vascular systems and often ancient evolutionary traits. Its subclass is Pinidae, which encompasses coniferous trees and shrubs, typically with needle-like leaves and cone-bearing reproductive structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Pinales, a group of coniferous plants that includes pines, firs, and other needle-leaved evergreens. Its family is Pinaceae, commonly known as the pine family, which includes many economically important conifer species. Its genus is Abies, which consists of evergreen coniferous trees commonly known as firs, characterized by their flat, spruce-like needles and clustered cones.</p>
<p>Its species is Abies hidalgensis, a specific type of fir native to certain regions of Mexico, distinguished by its unique morphological and genetic characteristics.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies hidalgensis is primarily native to the northeastern region of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous areas of this region, particularly in the states of Hidalgo, San Luis Potosí, and Querétaro. This species thrives in temperate climates with high altitudes and moist conditions. It is commonly found in forests and mixed woodlands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the northeastern part of the country.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies hidalgensis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and high elevation, where it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils, often growing in mixed forests. This species is particularly adapted to areas with moderate precipitation and limited sunlight. Its introduction has been noted in regions such as the western United States and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific ecological requirements.</p>
