                    <h1>Abies hidalgensis</h1>
<p>Abies hidalgensis, commonly known as the Hidalgo fir, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the stems. The tree produces cones that are elongated and cylindrical, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high elevations, often growing in dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, the Hidalgo fir is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
