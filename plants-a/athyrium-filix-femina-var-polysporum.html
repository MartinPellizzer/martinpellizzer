                    <h1>Athyrium filix-femina var. polysporum</h1>
<p>Athyrium filix-femina var. polysporum, commonly known as the variable lady fern, is a variant of the lady fern characterized by its variable frond morphology.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb native to eastern North America, typically found in moist, shaded woodland habitats. The plant features bipinnate fronds that are often more robust and longer than those of the typical variety. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common trait in ferns.</p>
<p>The varietal name "polysporum" refers to its abundance of spores, highlighting its reproductive characteristics.</p>
