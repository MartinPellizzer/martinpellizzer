<p>Acnistus plumieri, commonly known as the silver vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, spreading growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often followed by bright red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Acnistus plumieri is also known for its ability to attract birds and insects due to its showy flowers and fruit.</p>

<p>Acnistus plumieri has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 2–5 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, often branching, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release three winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing it to spread aggressively in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
