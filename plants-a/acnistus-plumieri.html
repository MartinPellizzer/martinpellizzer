                <h1>Acnistus plumieri</h1>
<p>Acnistus plumieri, commonly known as the stinkbush, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, plum-like berries. These berries are toxic to humans and animals, making the plant potentially hazardous.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies have led to its classification as a weed in some areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus plumieri has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically 2-5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, somewhat hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing in a branching pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant establish quickly in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus plumieri is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of the Middle East, including Israel and Saudi Arabia. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest undergrowth. It is commonly found in coastal areas and can tolerate salt spray, which allows it to grow in some coastal regions.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus plumieri was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as an ornamental plant due to its rapid growth and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It has become invasive in several regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering ecosystem dynamics. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by animals and water, leading to its establishment in new areas. Its introduction has been associated with human activities such as landscaping and land clearing.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a noxious weed in many parts of the world.</p>
