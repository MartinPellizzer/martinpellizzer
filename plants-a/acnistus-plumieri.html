                    <h1>Acnistus plumieri</h1>
<p>Acnistus plumieri, commonly known as the stinkbush, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, plum-like berries. These berries are toxic to humans and animals, making the plant potentially hazardous.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies have led to its classification as a weed in some areas.</p>
