                <h1>Adenocalymma alboaurantiacum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma alboaurantiacum, commonly known as the white-tinged adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers with prominent stamens. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma alboaurantiacum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma alboaurantiacum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a dark green upper surface and lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white to pale yellow petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late winter to early spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma alboaurantiacum is primarily native to Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, and Brazil West-Central.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical regions of these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils within forested habitats. Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones in northeastern and central Brazil.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in the local biodiversity of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma alboaurantiacum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a warm climate and low rainfall, such as parts of southern Africa. This plant is often associated with rocky or sandy soils and can thrive in environments with minimal competition. Its introduction has been linked to human activity, including landscaping and erosion control efforts.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
