<p>Acanthophyllum crassinodum, commonly known as the broad-noded acanthophyllum, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppes and semi-desert areas.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert animals.</p>
