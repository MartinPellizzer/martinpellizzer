                <h1>Acrostichum sorbifolium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum sorbifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, compound leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Its fronds are arranged in a distinctive, feather-like pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of the leaves.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum sorbifolium has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to anchor in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum sorbifolium is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, moist soil, often found near rivers and in dense tropical forests. This plant is commonly associated with swampy or seasonally flooded habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its distribution is closely linked to the monsoon climate patterns that characterize these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not found outside of this native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum sorbifolium was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near water bodies or in riparian zones.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates with high levels of precipitation. This plant is typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Its introduction has been documented in several regions of Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
