                        <h1>Acacia sessiliceps</h1>
<p>Acacia sessiliceps, commonly known as the sessile-headed acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and pairs of small, stipulate leaves. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that are typically clustered in dense, upright inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Acacia sessiliceps is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia sessiliceps is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically the coastal regions of New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coast and in open forests. This species thrives in areas with a temperate climate and is often associated with coastal dunes and heathlands. It is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat for various native animals.</p>
<p>Acacia sessiliceps is also known for its distinctive, globular acorns and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia sessiliceps was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of ornamental horticulture and for soil stabilization in degraded lands.</p>
<p>It is now considered an invasive species in several regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting management strategies to control its spread.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive nature, it remains popular in landscaping due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature.</p>
