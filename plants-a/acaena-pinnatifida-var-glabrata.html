                    <h1>Acaena pinnatifida var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Acaena pinnatifida var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth burrweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. The plant has alternate, pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in forest understories and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The smooth, glabrous stems and reduced foliage distinguish this variety from other Acaena species.</p>
