                            <h1>Anthyllis Vulneraria Subsp. Macedonica</h1>
<p>Macedonian scotch broom, scientifically known as Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. macedonica, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Macedonian region. This subspecies is part of the legume family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and cliffs where other plants struggle to survive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, the Macedonian scotch broom is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique and ecologically important plant.</p>
