                <h1>Adamanthus simplex</h1>
<p>Adamanthus simplex, commonly known as the Florida holly or swamp holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Adamanthus simplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adamanthus simplex has alternate, simple, elliptical leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm long, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a light brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its inflorescences are compound panicles with small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus simplex is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and the lower part of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of swamps where there is consistent moisture. This plant thrives in sandy or peaty soils and is often associated with coastal environments. It is an important component of the wetland ecosystems in its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus simplex was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and rivers. This plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. It thrives in moist to wet conditions and can tolerate partial shade to full sun.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems.</p>
