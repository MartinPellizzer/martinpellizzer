                <h1>Achillea alpina subsp. multiflora</h1>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>multiflora, commonly known as Alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a robust root system and upright, hairy stems that support its feathery, finely divided leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for alpine gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>multiflora has basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate, arranged in a rosette, with a blue-gray color and a hairy surface. The stems are upright, branching, and covered in fine hairs, with a greenish-gray bark.</p>
<p>Its flowers are compound umbels of small, white to pale yellow florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>multiflora is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan. It has been introduced to other parts of the world, including Europe and North America, where it is often found in gardens and naturalized areas.</p>
<p>This species thrives in dry, rocky, or gravelly soils and is commonly found in alpine meadows and open grasslands. It typically grows at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its widespread cultivation and naturalization, it is not considered a threatened species and is generally of low conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>multiflora is a hardy perennial known for its bright yellow flowers and compact growth habit. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth in spring and flowering in late summer to early fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding wet conditions. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its appearance and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>multiflora is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, due to its abundant flowers and structural support.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a healthy ecosystem. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing slopes and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and promoting the growth of other native plants.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
