                <h1>Actinea doniana</h1>
<p>Actinea doniana, commonly known as the red mangrove or *Rhizophora mucronata*, is a mangrove species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and prop roots that help stabilize coastal soils. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, playing a crucial role in coastal ecosystems. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in the summer months.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release buoyant seeds, aiding in its dispersal across water.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea doniana has large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 20â€“30 cm in diameter, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with five petals, blooming during the rainy season, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea doniana is a tropical plant native to the wetlands and mangrove forests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific, where it thrives in brackish or saline water environments. It typically grows in coastal areas, estuaries, and tidal flats, often at low altitudes near sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and degradation, Actinea doniana is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinea doniana is a tropical plant known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Actinea doniana involves a period of active growth during the rainy season, followed by a rest period during the dry season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or fungal infections, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or garlic can help deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinea doniana is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants in its vicinity. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along riverbanks and wetlands.</p>
<p>Overall, Actinea doniana plays a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance and supporting diverse ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Actinea doniana is a plant known for its diverse uses and applications across various fields.</p>
