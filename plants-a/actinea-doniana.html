                <h1>Actinea doniana</h1>
<p>Actinea doniana, commonly known as the white mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces fragrant white flowers that are followed by edible, segmented fruits. The fruit's outer layer, or pericarp, is typically purple or red, while the inner segments are white and juicy.</p>
<p>Actinea doniana is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its culinary and medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea doniana has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 10 to 20 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, with a smooth texture. The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the dry season, relying on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea doniana is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Cameroon.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid lowland forests and is commonly found in swampy or wetland habitats. This plant is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. It is often associated with riverine and coastal ecosystems where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its natural distribution has been reduced in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea doniana was mainly introduced to regions where its ornamental value and adaptability to disturbed soils make it suitable for landscaping and erosion control.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and can quickly spread through its rhizomes, leading to dense vegetation. Due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species, it has become a concern in some ecosystems where it is non-native.</p>
<p>Its introduction has sometimes resulted in ecological impacts, prompting management efforts in invaded areas.</p>
