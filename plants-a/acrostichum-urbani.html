                <h1>Acrostichum urbani</h1>
<p>Acrostichum urbani, commonly known as the urban fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that resemble those of other ferns in the family Polypodiaceae. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acrostichum urbani is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum urbani has large, leathery leaves that are elongated and sword-shaped, arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and spread out to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum urbani is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed habitats and can sometimes be found in urban areas due to its adaptability. Its distribution is also documented in parts of Oceania, particularly in Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Acrostichum urbani is known for its robust growth and ability to colonize areas with high moisture levels.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum urbani was mainly introduced to urban and industrial areas where air pollution is high.</p>
<p>This plant has adapted well to contaminated soils and can tolerate high levels of pollutants such as heavy metals and sulfur dioxide. It is often found growing along roadsides, in waste areas, and near factories. Its ability to thrive in such environments makes it an important indicator species for environmental monitoring.</p>
<p>The distribution of Acrostichum urbani reflects its role as a pioneer species in disturbed ecosystems.</p>
