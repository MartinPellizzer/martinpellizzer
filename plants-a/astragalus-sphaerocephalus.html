<p>Astragalus sphaerocephalus, commonly known as the globe milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, inflated seed pods and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Astragalus sphaerocephalus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
