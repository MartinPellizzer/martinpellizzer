<p>Anemone drummondii subsp.</p>
<p>heimburgeri, commonly known as the Heimburger's anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and desert scrub.</p>
<p>The plant features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to other anemone species in the region.</p>
