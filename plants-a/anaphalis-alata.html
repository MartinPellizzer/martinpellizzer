                    <h1>Anaphalis alata</h1>
<p>Anaphalis alata, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woolly, silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Anaphalis alata is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens.</p>
