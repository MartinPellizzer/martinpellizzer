                    <h1>Aristolochia odoratissima var. grandiflora</h1>
<p>Aristolochia odoratissima var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often greenish-white in color. The plant produces showy, fragrant blossoms that attract insects, particularly flies, which aid in pollination. Its unique floral structure and medicinal properties have made it a subject of both botanical and pharmacological interest.</p>
<p>However, it contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to kidney damage.</p>
