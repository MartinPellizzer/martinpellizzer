                    <h1>Armeria alpinifolia</h1>
<p>Armeria alpinifolia, commonly known as the alpine thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plantings.</p>
<p>Armeria alpinifolia is also valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
