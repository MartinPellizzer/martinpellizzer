                <h1>Acrostemon hirsutus</h1>
<p>Acrostemon hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy acrostemon, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers, and is characterized by its ornamental foliage and fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring broad, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its inflorescence consists of clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>Acrostemon hirsutus is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostemon hirsutus has broad, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured as the plant matures. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostemon hirsutus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in swampy or wetland habitats. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with riverbanks and lowland forests. Its distribution extends to parts of the Indian subcontinent, including India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Acrostemon hirsutus is well adapted to wet conditions and is often seen growing in areas with standing water.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostemon hirsutus was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking purple and pink flowers. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
