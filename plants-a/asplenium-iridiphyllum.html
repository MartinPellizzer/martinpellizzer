<p>Asplenium iridiphyllum, commonly known as the iridescent spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that often display a striking iridescent sheen, especially when exposed to light.

Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Asplenium iridiphyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
