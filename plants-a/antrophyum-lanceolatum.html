<p>Antrophyum lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are lance-shaped and stiff. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
