                    <h1>Agrostis andicola</h1>
<p>Agrostis andicola, commonly known as the Andean bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine zones. Its fine texture and dense growth make it a valuable component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>Agrostis andicola plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates in its native range.</p>
