                    <h1>Acacia haematomma</h1>
<p>Acacia haematomma, commonly known as the blood acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces flat, globular pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Acacia haematomma is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine by Indigenous Australians for its purported healing properties.</p>
