<p>Andropogon sorghum var. cafer, commonly known as sweet sorghum, is a tall, warm-season grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust stem, which can grow up to 3 meters in height, and its dense, spike-like inflorescence that produces small, two-lobed flowers. The plant is valued for its high sugar content in its stalks, making it a source for biofuel and syrup production. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is also used in erosion control and as a forage crop for livestock.</p>
