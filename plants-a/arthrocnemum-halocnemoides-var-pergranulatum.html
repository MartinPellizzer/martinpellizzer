<p>Arthrocnemum halocnemoides var. pergranulatum, commonly known as the granulated saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It possesses succulent, fleshy leaves that help store water and reduce transpiration. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and saline soils where it tolerates high salt concentrations. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or yellowish, and it produces small, round seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its granular texture on the stems and leaves, which contributes to its common name.</p>
