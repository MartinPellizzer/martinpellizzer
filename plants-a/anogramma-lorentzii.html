<p>Anogramma lorentzii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that often grow on rocks or trees. The plant has a rhizome that is covered in a thick layer of spongy, moss-like tissue, which helps it absorb moisture from the air. Its leaves are typically divided into narrow segments and are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>Anogramma lorentzii prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
