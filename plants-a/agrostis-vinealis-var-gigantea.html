                    <h1>Agrostis vinealis var. gigantea</h1>
<p>Agrostis vinealis var. gigantea, commonly known as giant bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth and ability to form dense mats, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
