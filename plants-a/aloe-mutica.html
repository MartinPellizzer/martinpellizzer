                    <h1>Aloe mutica</h1>
<p>Aloe mutica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the warmer months, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Aloe mutica is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and indoor gardening.</p>
