                <h1>Aechmea contracta</h1>
<p>Aechmea contracta, commonly known as the compact aechmea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a central cup, which collects rainwater for its epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding visual interest. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Aechmea contracta is popular in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea contracta has rosette-shaped leaves that are stiff, grass-like, and arranged in a compact circle, with a dark green to blue-gray coloration.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, underground rhizome that supports its growth. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, with white to pink flowers that bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, red berry that contains seeds dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its natural habitat.</p>
