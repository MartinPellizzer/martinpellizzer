                    <h1>Aechmea contracta</h1>
<p>Aechmea contracta, commonly known as the compact aechmea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a central cup, which collects rainwater for its epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding visual interest. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Aechmea contracta is popular in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
