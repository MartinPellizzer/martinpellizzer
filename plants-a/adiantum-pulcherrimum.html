                <h1>Adiantum pulcherrimum</h1>
<p>Adiantum pulcherrimum, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the forest floor. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Adiantum pulcherrimum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or wetland areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum pulcherrimum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically triangular in shape, arranged in a rosette pattern, and can grow up to 30 cm in length, displaying a bright green color that turns bronze in autumn. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is smooth and pale green, growing from a rhizome and often forming a compact, bushy structure. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, which are wind-pollinated and consist of separate male and female structures.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that disperses tiny seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's spread and anchoring.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pulcherrimum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. This fern is commonly associated with limestone soils and is known for its delicate, lace-like fronds. It is also found in parts of Mexico and the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to humid climates and plays an important role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pulcherrimum was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, delicate fronds.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Although it is not native to these regions, it has been widely cultivated and occasionally escapes into the wild. Its introduction has led to its presence in some natural areas, where it can compete with native plant species.</p>
<p>Despite its popularity, it is considered a non-native invasive species in certain parts of its range.</p>
