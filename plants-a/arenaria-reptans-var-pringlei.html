                    <h1>Arenaria reptans var. pringlei</h1>
<p>Arenaria reptans var. pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of the western United States.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky substrates. Its leaves are linear and succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
