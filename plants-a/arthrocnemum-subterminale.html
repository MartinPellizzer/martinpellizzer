                    <h1>Arthrocnemum subterminale</h1>
<p>Arthrocnemum subterminale, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in sandy soils and is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats.</p>
