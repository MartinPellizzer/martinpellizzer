                <h1>Acrophorus macrocarpus</h1>
<p>Acrophorus macrocarpus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant's showy white flowers bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by stabilizing water surfaces and supporting biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus macrocarpus has leaves that are alternate, simple, and ovate in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically reddish-brown in color, and it exhibits a vertical growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus macrocarpus is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often in humid and shaded environments. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is typically associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats. It plays an important ecological role in these regions by providing food and shelter for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some parts of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus macrocarpus was mainly introduced to enhance biodiversity and provide ecological benefits in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields. The plant has been used for soil stabilization due to its deep root system and ability to thrive in poor soils. Its introduction has helped in rehabilitating areas affected by deforestation and land degradation.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential impacts on native ecosystems.</p>
