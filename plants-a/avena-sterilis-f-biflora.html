                    <h1>Avena sterilis f. biflora</h1>
<p>Avena sterilis f. biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered oat, is a sterile variant of the oat species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced seed production and the presence of two flowers per spikelet, distinguishing it from typical oat plants. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of climates. Its botanical features include slender, grass-like leaves and a compact growth habit.</p>
<p>While it lacks the agricultural value of common oats, it is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique floral structure.</p>
