                    <h1>Anthericum favosum</h1>
<p>Anthericum favosum, commonly known as the favous bellflower, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a spathe, a feature common in many arum species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Anthericum favosum is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
