                <h1>Acioa dulcis</h1>
<p>Acioa dulcis, commonly known as the sweet acioa, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Acioa dulcis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acioa dulcis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa dulcis is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and abundant rainfall. This plant is commonly found in the understory of rainforests and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its native habitat, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa dulcis was mainly introduced to new areas for its ornamental value and potential use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>It has been established in various regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant's ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates has contributed to its spread. It is often cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, there are concerns about its potential to become invasive in some ecosystems.</p>
