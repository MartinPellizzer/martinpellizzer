                <h1>Aeginetia scortechinii</h1>
<p>Aeginetia scortechinii, commonly known as the yellow dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and covered in fine pubescence. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that are enclosed in a pappus, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>Aeginetia scortechinii thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeginetia scortechinii has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody, with a light green to grayish bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-valved capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
