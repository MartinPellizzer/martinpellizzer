                    <h1>Amygdalus gjarnyensis</h1>
<p>Amygdalus gjarnyensis, commonly known as the Gjarny almond, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by the development of its characteristic almond-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
