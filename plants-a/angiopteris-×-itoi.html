                    <h1>Angiopteris × itoi</h1>
<p>Angiopteris × itoi, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Angiopteris evecta and Angiopteris eardleyi.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Angiopteris × itoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
