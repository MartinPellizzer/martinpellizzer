<p>Artemisia spinescens, commonly known as spiny wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features gray-green, aromatic foliage with silvery-white, glandular hairs that contribute to its distinctive appearance and strong, camphor-like odor. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical heads. Its woody stems are often sparsely branched and covered in fine, needle-like structures.</p>
<p>Artemisia spinescens is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
