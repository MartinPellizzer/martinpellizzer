                    <h1>Alisma graminifolium f. pumilum</h1>
<p>Alisma graminifolium f. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf arrowhead, is a compact variant of the arrowhead plant native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It features small, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for waterlogged soils. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in umbels. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in marshy environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
