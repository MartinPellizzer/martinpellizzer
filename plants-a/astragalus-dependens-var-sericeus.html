<p>Astragalus dependens var. sericeus, commonly known as the silky milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has finely hairy foliage, which gives it its "sericeus" designation, meaning silky in Latin. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
