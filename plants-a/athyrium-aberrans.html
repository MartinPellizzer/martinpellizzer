                    <h1>Athyrium aberrans</h1>
<p>Athyrium aberrans, commonly known as the variable fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern Himalayas and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that often exhibit a wide range of morphological variation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The botanical significance of Athyrium aberrans lies in its adaptability and role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats.</p>
