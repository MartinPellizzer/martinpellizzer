                    <h1>Archanthemis trotzkiana</h1>
<p>Archanthemis trotzkiana, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that disperse seeds via the wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it a common weed in disturbed soils across its native range.</p>
