The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of dry, winged fruits. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water conservation mechanisms.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an important component of its native desert ecosystems.</p>
