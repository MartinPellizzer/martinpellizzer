                    <h1>Astragalus unifoliolatus</h1>
<p>Astragalus unifoliolatus, commonly known as the single leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and a single, trifoliate leaflet at the base of each stem. The plant produces small, yellow to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Astragalus unifoliolatus is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
