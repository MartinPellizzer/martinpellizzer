<p>Achaetogeron garciae, commonly known as the Garcia's spiky moss, is a rare and unique liverwort species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant exhibits a complex thallus structure with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are often covered in tiny, spiny protrusions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocky substrates or in humid forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Achaetogeron garciae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
