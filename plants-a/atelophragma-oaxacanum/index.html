                            <h1>Atelophragma Oaxacanum</h1>
<p>Atelophragma oaxacanum is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Oaxaca in Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family and is known for its striking violet-colored flowers that bloom in the early morning. This plant is particularly adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and faces threats from deforestation and climate change. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this rare species and preserve its ecological role.</p>
