<p>Allosorus deltodeus, commonly known as the deltoid fern, is a rare and unique species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, deltoid-shaped fronds that are often divided into three lobes, giving it a striking appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rich, organic soil along stream banks or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Allosorus deltodeus is known for its slow growth and is often considered a conservation concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
