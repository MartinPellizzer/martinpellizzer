                    <h1>Anticlea neglecta</h1>
<p>Anticlea neglecta, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal in the harsh desert environment.</p>
