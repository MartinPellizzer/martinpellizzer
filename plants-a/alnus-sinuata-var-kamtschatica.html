<p>Alnus sinuata var. kamtschatica, commonly known as the Kamchatka alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Russian Far East and parts of northern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its serrated, sinuate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that release seeds when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and forest edges.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration and ecological succession.</p>
