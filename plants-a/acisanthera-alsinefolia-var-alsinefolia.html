<p>Acisanthera alsinefolia var. alsinefolia, commonly known as the small-flowered sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with numerous branching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
