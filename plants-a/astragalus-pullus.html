                    <h1>Astragalus pullus</h1>
<p>Astragalus pullus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. Astragalus pullus has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across open landscapes.</p>
