<p>Allophylus pachyphyllus, commonly known as the thick-leaved alpine holly, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that is adapted to withstand harsh, high-altitude conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for various birds. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
