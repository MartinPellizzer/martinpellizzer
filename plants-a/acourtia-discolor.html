                <h1>Acourtia discolor</h1>
<p>Acourtia discolor, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acourtia discolor is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia discolor has small, narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is low-growing, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark and a creeping growth pattern that allows it to spread across the ground. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with white to pale pink petals and a bell-shaped structure, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted for nutrient absorption in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia discolor is primarily native to Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats. It is commonly associated with desert environments.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of northern Mexico, particularly in the states of Chihuahua and Coahuila.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia discolor was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along trails.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. Its introduction has led to its establishment in non-native environments where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in disturbed ecosystems.</p>
