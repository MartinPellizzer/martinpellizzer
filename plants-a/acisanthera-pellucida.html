                <h1>Acisanthera pellucida</h1>
<p>Acisanthera pellucida, commonly known as the glassy bladdernut, is a species of flowering plant in the family Hippocastanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, where it typically grows in moist, wooded areas. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acisanthera pellucida is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acisanthera pellucida has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth, glossy surface and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white to pale yellow petals and a fragrant scent, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soil conditions and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera pellucida is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open grasslands, savannas, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of southern Arabia and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can be found in a variety of ecosystems within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera pellucida was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, delicate flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in wetland and riparian habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have led to ecological concerns.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its spread and protect local biodiversity.</p>
