                        <h1>Acalypha riedeliana</h1>
<p>Acalypha riedeliana, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, veined leaves that range from green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Acalypha riedeliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha riedeliana belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises a group of vascular plants that includes horsetails and their relatives, known for their primitive features. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by their floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a diverse group of flowering plants that includes many species with specialized adaptations for various environments. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse forms and often contains latex-producing species. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "false holly," characterized by their showy bracts and often hairy foliage.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha riedeliana, a specific type within the genus Acalypha, known for its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha riedeliana is primarily native to Brazil South.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of Brazil, particularly in the states of Paran√°, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its ornamental foliage.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific regions within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha riedeliana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in several areas. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing along stream banks and in disturbed habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it poses a threat to native ecosystems by outcompeting local flora.</p>
