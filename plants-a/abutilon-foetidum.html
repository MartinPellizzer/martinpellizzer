                <h1>Abutilon foetidum</h1>
<p>Abutilon foetidum, commonly known as the stinkweed or odorless abutilon, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that emit a strong, unpleasant odor when crushed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Abutilon foetidum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon foetidum has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are pendulous, with a spathaceous bract enclosing a cluster of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon foetidum is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in countries such as Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Central and South America, as well as some regions in the Caribbean. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. This species is typically found at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from habitat loss, Abutilon foetidum is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon foetidum is a fast-growing, semi-evergreen shrub native to South America, known for its velvety leaves and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick establishment. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-draining soil, requiring regular watering during the growing season but avoiding waterlogging.</p>
