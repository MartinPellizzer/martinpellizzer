                <h1>Aconitum laetum</h1>
<p>Aconitum laetum, commonly known as the meadow aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a poisonous plant and should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum laetum has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are typically deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they can reach up to 20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hollow, and has a smooth, bluish-green bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurred lower petal, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The plant produces follicles as its fruit, containing small, dark seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, which help it survive in its alpine or woodland habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum laetum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. This plant is also present in parts of southern Scandinavia and western Russia. It is known for its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for cooler climates, it is less common in lower elevation areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum laetum was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade in the 19th century.</p>
<p>It was initially cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking blue-violet flowers. However, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native plant species in wetland and woodland habitats. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to thrive in moist, disturbed soils and its prolific seed production.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now focused on controlling its spread and protecting local ecosystems.</p>
