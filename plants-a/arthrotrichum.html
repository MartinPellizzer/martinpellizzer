                    <h1>Arthrotrichum</h1>
<p>Arthrotrichum, commonly known as the rockmoss, is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, delicate stature and are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The leaves of Arthrotrichum species are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral, with a distinct costa that extends beyond the apex. They play an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in their native habitats.</p>
<p>Due to their specialized growth requirements, many species of Arthrotrichum are considered rare or endangered.</p>
