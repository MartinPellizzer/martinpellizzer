<p>Alnus incana var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves, which are typically alternate and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that release seeds when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest edges.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
