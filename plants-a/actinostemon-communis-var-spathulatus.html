                <h1>Actinostemon communis var. spathulatus</h1>
<p>Actinostemon communis var. spathulatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf actinostemon, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking, spathelike bracts that enclose its small, showy flowers, which are typically pink to purple in color. The plant has strap-shaped leaves that are often broader than they are long, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its unique foliage and delicate floral display in garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemon communis var. spathulatus has ovate to spatulate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon communis var. spathulatus is a rare plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within its native range due to habitat loss and fragmentation. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. This species is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from human activity, it is classified as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinostemon communis var. spathulatus is a unique and ornamental plant that thrives in well-drained soil and moderate watering.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or division, which are both effective methods for maintaining its genetic traits. This plant has a perennial growth cycle, blooming in late spring or early summer and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it requires regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning after flowering to encourage bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinostemon communis var. spathulatus is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, tubular flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through mutualistic relationships. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>
