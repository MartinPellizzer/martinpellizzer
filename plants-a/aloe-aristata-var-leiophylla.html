<p>It features dense clusters of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a frosty appearance due to a powdery coating. The plant produces upright, branched inflorescences with small, tubular flowers that range from yellow to orange in color. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and thriving in full sun with well-draining soil.</p>
