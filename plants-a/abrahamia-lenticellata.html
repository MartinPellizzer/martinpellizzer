                    <h1>Abrahamia lenticellata</h1>
<p>Abrahamia lenticellata, commonly known as the smoothleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate stems and small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. Its succulent leaves and compact growth habit allow it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Abrahamia lenticellata plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
