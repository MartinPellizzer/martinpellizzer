                    <h1>Aster altaicus var. scaber</h1>
<p>Aster altaicus var. scaber, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a perennial herb native to the steppes and semi-desert regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered blue to purple flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
