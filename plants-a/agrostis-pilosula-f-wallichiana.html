<p>Agrostis pilosula f. wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
