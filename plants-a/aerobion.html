                    <h1>Aerobion</h1>
<p>Aerobion, commonly known as the air plant, is a type of epiphytic bromeliad that thrives without soil.</p>
<p>It absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than roots, making it well adapted to humid environments. The plant's rosette-shaped structure collects rainwater, which it uses for hydration. Aerobion produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in air and light makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
