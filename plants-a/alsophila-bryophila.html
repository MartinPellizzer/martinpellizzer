<p>Alsophila bryophila, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and a crown of feathery, light green fronds. The plant has a unique structure with a thick, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Alsophila bryophila thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in forest understories.</p>
