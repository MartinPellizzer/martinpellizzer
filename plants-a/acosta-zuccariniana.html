                <h1>Acosta zuccariniana</h1>
<p>Acosta zuccariniana, commonly known as the Zuccarini's acosta, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Acosta zuccariniana is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cooler, humid climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta zuccariniana has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green color, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rough and fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and attracting insect pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta zuccariniana is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, typically at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and moderate rainfall. It is often associated with mountain ecosystems and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the Andes.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta zuccariniana was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. The plant thrives in humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its introduction has been associated with both horticultural and ecological impacts.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>
