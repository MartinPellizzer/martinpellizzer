<p>Antennaria polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, hairy leaves that form a mat-like structure close to the ground. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded cymes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Antennaria polyphylla is an important component of high-elevation ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
