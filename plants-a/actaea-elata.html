                <h1>Actaea elata</h1>
<p>Actaea elata, commonly known as the white crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that bear clusters of white, petal-like flowers. The plant has large, palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Actaea elata is also known for its showy, spiky seed heads that appear after the flowers, adding to its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea elata has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are green on top and slightly hairy underneath, with a broad ovate shape and a serrated margin, typically measuring up to 20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age, growing upright and branching towards the top. It produces small, white flowers arranged in an umbel, blooming in early summer, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry containing several seeds, which are dispersed by birds and animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish new growth.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea elata is primarily native to British Columbia, Oregon, and Washington.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in moist, shaded forest environments throughout these regions. It thrives in areas with rich, well-drained soils and is often associated with coniferous and mixedwood forests. The distribution of Actaea elata is limited to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining forest biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea elata was mainly introduced to North America through human activities such as horticulture and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats like roadsides, forest edges, and open woodlands. The plant thrives in moist to dry soils and can tolerate partial to full shade. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions, sometimes competing with native flora.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered highly invasive and is often managed in controlled environments.</p>
