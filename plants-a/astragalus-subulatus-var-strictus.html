<p>Astragalus subulatus var. strictus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm, featuring slender, spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-purple. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, needle-like leaflets, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is often found in dry grasslands, rocky slopes, and sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
