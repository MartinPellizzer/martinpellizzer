<p>Allosorus rotundifolius, commonly known as the roundleaf spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic liverwort found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a rosette of fleshy, rounded leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. Its reproductive structures, called archegonia, are located on the lower surface of the leaves.</p>
<p>Allosorus rotundifolius is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in temperate regions.</p>
