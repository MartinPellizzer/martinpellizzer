<p>Anthericum verruciferum, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces tall, unbranched stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, greenish-white flowers with prominent yellow stamens. Its reproductive structures include showy, three-lobed anthers that release pollen in response to wind or touch.</p>
<p>Anthericum verruciferum is often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats.</p>
