                <h1>Aegilops straussii</h1>
<p>Aegilops straussii, commonly known as the Strauss's goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically borne in dense clusters along the stem. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Aegilops straussii is valued for its role in agricultural research due to its genetic relationship with wheat and potential for improving crop resilience.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops straussii has leaves that are narrow, grass-like, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a single, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a glume that encloses the seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid environments by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>
