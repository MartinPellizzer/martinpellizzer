                <h1>Achillea fragrantissima</h1>
<p>Achillea fragrantissima, commonly known as sweet yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, flat-topped clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and features finely divided, feather-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its fragrant foliage and showy blooms make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea fragrantissima has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and have a dark green color with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a light green color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene that is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea fragrantissima is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in countries such as Italy, Spain, and France.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited, with populations primarily found in isolated regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and coastal areas. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea fragrantissima is considered a rare plant and is listed as endangered in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea fragrantissima is a hardy perennial known for its fragrant, flat-topped flowers and ability to thrive in various garden conditions.</p>
