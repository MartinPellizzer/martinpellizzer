                <h1>Achillea fragrantissima</h1>
<p>Achillea fragrantissima, commonly known as sweet yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features finely divided, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white to pinkish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its aromatic properties and ornamental value have made it a valued plant in both horticulture and traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea fragrantissima has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, serrated, and have a gray-green color, arranged in a rosette formation and measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green color, growing from the base and branching towards the top. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk florets surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea fragrantissima is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in countries such as Spain, Portugal, and southern France.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. This plant typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its restricted distribution and habitat specificity make it a species of concern for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea fragrantissima is a hardy perennial known for its fragrant foliage and upright growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a dormant winter growth cycle, becoming active in spring and flowering in summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilize it with a balanced fertilizer in spring, and prune faded flower heads to encourage reblooming.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs, and it pairs well with lavender or sedum in companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea fragrantissima is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem. This plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other wildflowers to enhance garden diversity. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers habitat and shelter for small insects and animals, supporting a healthy ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea fragrantissima is a flowering plant known for its aromatic qualities and diverse applications.</p>
<p>In culinary use, its leaves and flowers can be used to flavor teas and desserts, adding a subtle herbal note.

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea fragrantissima has several popular cultivars such as 'Purpurea' and 'Marginata' that are favored for their ornamental value and fragrance.</p>
<p>It is also involved in the creation of hybrids with other yarrow species, which often exhibit enhanced flower colors and improved hardiness. These varieties are prized in horticulture for their drought tolerance and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions. The plant's showy flowers and long bloom period make it a valuable addition to gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance is further enhanced by its role in attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
