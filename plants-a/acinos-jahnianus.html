                <h1>Acinos jahnianus</h1>
<p>Acinos jahnianus, commonly known as the Jahn's mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk florets. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in spring, typically in sunny, open habitats. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Acinos jahnianus is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its delicate, long-lasting flowers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos jahnianus has small, narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray coloration due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
