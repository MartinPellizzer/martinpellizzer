<p>Atriplex patula subsp.</p>
<p>glabriuscula, commonly known as smoothleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its glabrous (hairless) leaves and salt-tolerant properties, allowing it to thrive in saline soils.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open habitats such as desert scrub, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
