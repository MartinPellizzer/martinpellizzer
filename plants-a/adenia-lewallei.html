                <h1>Adenia lewallei</h1>
<p>Adenia lewallei, commonly known as the Lewalle's adenia, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae, which includes passionflowers, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive crown-like structure, often featuring five or six petals. Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains several seeds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Adenia lewallei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia lewallei has leaves that are simple, alternate, and elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips, and it grows as a shrub with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from September to November, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their small size and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia lewallei is primarily native to Burundi and Rwanda.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the eastern African region, specifically in these two countries. It grows in forested areas and is often associated with moist, shaded environments. Adenia lewallei is part of the Passifloraceae family and is known for its distinctive floral structure.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these regions, making it a rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia lewallei was mainly introduced to the eastern coastal regions of Australia, particularly in Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, open forests, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and urban environments.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native flora.</p>
