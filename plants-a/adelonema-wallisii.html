<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded forest understories. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and branching.</p>
<p>Adelonema wallisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelonema wallisii has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, hairy, and woody, with a greyish-brown bark that becomes rough and fissured with age.
