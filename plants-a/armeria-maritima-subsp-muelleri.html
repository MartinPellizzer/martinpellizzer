<p>Armeria maritima subsp.</p>
<p>muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or coastal cliffs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
