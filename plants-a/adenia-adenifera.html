                <h1>Adenia adenifera</h1>
<p>Adenia adenifera, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed adenium, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, often woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Adenia adenifera is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia adenifera has alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically green and glossy, with a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and covered with a smooth, pale gray bark that peels off in strips. Its flowers are small, clustered in loose inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia adenifera is primarily native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is found in the dense rainforest regions of this country. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments within these forests. It is commonly seen in the lowland and mountainous areas of DR Congo.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia adenifera was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal forests and mountainous regions where humidity is high. The plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and has been cultivated for both horticultural and ecological purposes. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, it is also used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>
