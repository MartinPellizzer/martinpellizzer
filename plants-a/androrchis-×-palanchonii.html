                    <h1>Androrchis × palanchonii</h1>
<p>Androrchis × palanchonii, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a cross between Androrchis alpina and Androrchis palanchonii, resulting in a unique blend of characteristics from both parent species.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and Alps. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>This orchid thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and prefers cool, moist environments with partial shade.</p>
