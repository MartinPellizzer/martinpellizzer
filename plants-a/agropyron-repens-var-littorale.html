<p>Agropyron repens var. littorale, commonly known as beachgrass, is a coastal grass species adapted to sandy and saline environments.</p>
<p>It forms dense, low-growing mats that stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. It is often found in coastal regions of North America and Europe.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
