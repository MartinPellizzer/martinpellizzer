                <h1>Acrostichum corpulentum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum corpulentum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, robust fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, broad shape that makes it easily recognizable.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum corpulentum has large, broad, lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is robust and woody, with a rough, greyish bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, blooming in the spring and pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses its seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in moist soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum corpulentum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, moist soil, often found near riverbanks and in swampy environments. This plant is commonly associated with mangrove ecosystems and coastal forests where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its distribution is limited to these specific habitats due to its preference for high humidity and saline conditions.</p>
<p>Acrostichum corpulentum is an important component of the flora in these regions, contributing to the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum corpulentum was mainly introduced to disturbed coastal areas and wetlands, where it thrives in saline and brackish environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mangrove ecosystems and along tidal flats, often outcompeting native vegetation. This plant is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands. Its introduction has led to significant ecological impacts, including habitat modification and reduced biodiversity.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its effects on local ecosystems.</p>
