<p>Achyranthes rugulosa, commonly known as the rough knotweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes rugulosa has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy, with a bluish-green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, somewhat woody, and have a rough, fissured bark that is typically reddish-brown in color. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pale green to white petals and stamen, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
