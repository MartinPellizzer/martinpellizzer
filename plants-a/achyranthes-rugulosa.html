                <h1>Achyranthes rugulosa</h1>
<p>Achyranthes rugulosa, commonly known as the rough knotweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes rugulosa has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy, with a bluish-green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat branched, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and spreading, helping it anchor in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes rugulosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments like forests and along stream banks. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with wetland habitats. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across various regions where the climate supports its growth habits.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes rugulosa was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, feathery foliage and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated gardens into natural areas, particularly in the southeastern and southwestern regions. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in wetlands, where it can form dense stands. Its rapid growth and seed production contribute to its invasive potential in some ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered a noxious weed in several states due to its competitive nature and impact on native vegetation.</p>
