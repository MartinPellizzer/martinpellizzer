                <h1>Achyrophorus taraxacifolius</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus taraxacifolius, commonly known as the common groundsel, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus taraxacifolius has leaves that are heart-shaped, with a bright green color and a slightly hairy surface, arranged in a basal rosette and ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stout, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright from the base of the plant. Its flowers are yellow, with a composite structure resembling a dandelion, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus taraxacifolius is primarily native to southern China, including regions such as Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and Thailand. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and mountainous regions. It is commonly associated with areas that have a subtropical or temperate climate.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic regions, where it thrives in the natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus taraxacifolius was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forest margins and along stream banks.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly.</p>
