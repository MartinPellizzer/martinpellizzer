                    <h1>Avena byzantina</h1>
<p>Avena byzantina, commonly known as the Persian oat or Byzantine oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, white to pale blue flowers. Its seeds are encased in a hard, protective hull, which makes them resistant to environmental stress and aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Avena byzantina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
