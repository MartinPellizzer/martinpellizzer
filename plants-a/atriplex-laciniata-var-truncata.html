                    <h1>Atriplex laciniata var. truncata</h1>
<p>Atriplex laciniata var. truncata, commonly known as the narrowleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, serrated leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
