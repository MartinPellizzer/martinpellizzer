<p>Allomorphia longispicata, commonly known as the long-spined allomorph, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and waxy leaf surfaces. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and birds, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and ecological role in its habitat.</p>
