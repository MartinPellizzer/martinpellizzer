                    <h1>Angostylis tabulamontana</h1>
<p>Angostylis tabulamontana, commonly known as the mountain table fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
