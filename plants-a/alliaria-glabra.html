                    <h1>Alliaria glabra</h1>
<p>Alliaria glabra, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, round, black or brown seeds that are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plants and disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
