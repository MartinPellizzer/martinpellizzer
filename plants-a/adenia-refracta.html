                <h1>Adenia refracta</h1>
<p>Adenia refracta, commonly known as the African mountain gum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant features elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are usually yellow or greenish-yellow in color.</p>
<p>Adenia refracta is often found in rocky or wooded areas and is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia refracta has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically reddish-brown in color, and it exhibits a sprawling or climbing growth pattern. The flowers are large, showy, and usually pink or red, with a complex structure featuring five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia refracta is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern and southern parts of the island, particularly in humid lowland and mountainous regions. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. It is commonly seen in the undergrowth of primary and secondary forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to Madagascar, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia refracta was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can grow in both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
