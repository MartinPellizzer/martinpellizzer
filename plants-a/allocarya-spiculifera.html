<p>Allocarya spiculifera, commonly known as the spiky thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust, upright stem covered in sharp, spiny bracts that protect its flowering structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spiky clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are typically grayish-green with a woolly texture, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Allocarya spiculifera is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens.</p>
