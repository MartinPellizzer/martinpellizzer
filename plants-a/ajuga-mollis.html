<p>Ajuga mollis, commonly known as carpet bugle or silver carpet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery or grayish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in early to mid-summer. Ajuga mollis thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its ground-covering ability.</p>
<p>It is relatively drought-tolerant once established and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
