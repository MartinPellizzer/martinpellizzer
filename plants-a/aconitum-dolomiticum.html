                <h1>Aconitum dolomiticum</h1>
<p>Aconitum dolomiticum, commonly known as the Dolomite Monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Aconitum dolomiticum is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of alkaloids.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum dolomiticum has basal leaves that are palmately lobed, typically with 5-7 lobes, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant, and are dark green with a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color, and it grows in a straight, unbranched pattern. The flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving in rocky, high-altitude environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum dolomiticum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, particularly in countries such as Austria, Switzerland, Germany, and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils found in alpine and subalpine environments. This plant is commonly found in mountain meadows, slopes, and forested areas at high elevations. It is often associated with limestone and dolomite substrates, which give it its specific name.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum dolomiticum was mainly introduced to specific regions with calcareous soils and high altitudes, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained, loamy soils that are rich in calcium. This plant is typically associated with alpine and subalpine habitats, where it forms part of the specialized flora. Due to its unique ecological requirements, it is not commonly found in lowland or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction to new regions is often linked to human activities such as gardening or ecological restoration projects.</p>
