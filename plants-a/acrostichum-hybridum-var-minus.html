<p>Acrostichum hybridum var. minus, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a compact variety of the broad-leafed fern.</p>
<p>It features lush, dark green fronds that are shorter and more densely packed compared to its parent species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The fronds are leathery and have a distinctive, feathery appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
