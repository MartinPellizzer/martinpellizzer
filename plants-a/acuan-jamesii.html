                <h1>Acuan jamesii</h1>
<p>Acuan jamesii, commonly known as the James' acuan, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Acuan jamesii is often found in open woodlands and mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acuan jamesii has leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, bark that is reddish-brown and peels in thin layers. Its small, clustered flowers are pale yellow, with four petals, and bloom in early spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan jamesii is primarily native to the western United States, specifically found in Utah, Nevada, and Arizona.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open landscapes. This plant is commonly associated with desert scrub and grassland habitats. It is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan jamesii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in areas with dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Utah, Nevada, and parts of Arizona. This plant thrives in arid environments and is often seen growing along canyon walls and in desert scrublands. Its introduction has been largely due to natural dispersal and human activity.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
