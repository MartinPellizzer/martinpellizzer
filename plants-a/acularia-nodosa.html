                <h1>Acularia nodosa</h1>
<p>Acularia nodosa, commonly known as the nodular liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and the presence of small, rounded gemmae on its stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure consists of a thallus with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllidia.</p>
<p>Acularia nodosa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acularia nodosa has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly rough texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. It produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, featuring a simple structure with four petals, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acularia nodosa is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas and saline environments, often found on rocky shores and sandy beaches. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a common species in coastal ecosystems. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune systems and preventing soil erosion.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to regions with high salinity and low precipitation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acularia nodosa was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as the transport of contaminated soil or water.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed habitats, including roadsides, agricultural fields, and urban areas. The plant has shown rapid colonization abilities, allowing it to spread quickly in regions with suitable conditions. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>However, further research is needed to fully understand its ecological impact.</p>
