<p>Amborella, commonly known as the "living fossil" of flowering plants, is a unique species native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is one of the oldest known flowering plants, dating back over 140 million years. The plant has simple, undivided leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are not showy. Its reproductive structures are considered primitive, offering insights into the early evolution of angiosperms.</p>
<p>Amborella is critically endangered, with fewer than 1,000 individuals remaining in the wild.</p>
