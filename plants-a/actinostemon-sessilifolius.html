                    <h1>Actinostemon sessilifolius</h1>
<p>Actinostemon sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaf actinostemon, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of fleshy, elliptic leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack distinct petioles. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a dense, terminal inflorescence. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky or sandy soils in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
