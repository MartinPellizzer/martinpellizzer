                            <h1>Arabidopsis Lyrata Subsp. Kamchatica</h1>
<p>Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. kamchatica is a lesser-known member of the Brassicaceae family that thrives in the cold climates of northern regions. This subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and strikingly white or pale pink flowers. It is often found in rocky soils and alpine environments, where it adapts to harsh conditions with remarkable resilience. Despite its small size, it plays an important ecological role in pollination and soil stabilization. Its study offers valuable insights into plant adaptation and evolutionary biology.</p>
