<p>Asclepias rivularis, commonly known as the river milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It is a vital host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing food for both larvae and adult insects.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to moist soils makes it an important component of riparian ecosystems.</p>
