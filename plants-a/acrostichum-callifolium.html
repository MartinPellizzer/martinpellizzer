                <h1>Acrostichum callifolium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum callifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed brake, is a species of fern native to the wetlands and marshes of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that helps it thrive in waterlogged soils. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Acrostichum callifolium plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum callifolium has large, feather-like leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom in the spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum callifolium is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and along tidal flats where it thrives in saline or brackish water conditions. This plant is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands. It prefers humid climates and is often associated with estuarine and coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to its ability to tolerate saltwater and fluctuating water levels.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum callifolium was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its ability to stabilize soil. It thrives in saline and brackish conditions, making it suitable for coastal restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
