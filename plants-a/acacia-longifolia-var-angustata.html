                <h1>Acacia longifolia var. angustata</h1>
<p>Acacia longifolia var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf golden wattle, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, angular stems and bipinnate leaves that are narrow and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia longifolia var. angustata has narrow, dark green, linear leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a length of about 2-5 cm and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, woody, and have a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in globular or cylindrical heads, blooming from late summer to autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight, hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to access water in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia longifolia var. angustata is a shrub native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, where it occurs in the coastal regions of the Western and Eastern Cape provinces.</p>
<p>It has been introduced to other parts of the world, including Australia and New Zealand, where it has become naturalized. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, often in coastal dunes or near the shoreline. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to spread aggressively, it is considered an invasive species in some regions and is of concern for local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia longifolia var. angustata is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to southern Africa, known for its narrow leaves and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring scarification for better germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 3 to 5 years, and thrives in well-drained soils with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage flowering are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or aphids, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant succulents or native grasses can enhance its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia longifolia var. angustata is an important plant in coastal and sandy environments, providing food and shelter for a variety of wildlife.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds due to its nectar-rich flowers. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, improving soil fertility and supporting other plant growth. It also serves as a companion plant, helping to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Its ecological benefits make it a key species in maintaining the balance of coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acacia longifolia var. angustata is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications.</p>
