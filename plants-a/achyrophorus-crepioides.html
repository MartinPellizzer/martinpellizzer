                <h1>Achyrophorus crepioides</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus crepioides, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its latex-like sap is milky and can cause skin irritation.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its medicinal properties, though it is generally avoided due to its defensive spines.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus crepioides has broad, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces small, clustered yellow flowers with four petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus crepioides is primarily native to the temperate regions of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous areas. This plant is commonly found in regions with cool climates and high humidity. It is particularly associated with the Korean Peninsula and parts of southern China.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends to some areas of Southeast Asia as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus crepioides was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and open fields. This plant is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about ecological impact and habitat alteration in certain areas.</p>
<p>Proper management strategies are essential to control its spread and mitigate potential harm to local ecosystems.</p>
