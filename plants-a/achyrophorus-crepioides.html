<p>Achyrophorus crepioides, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its latex-like sap is milky and can cause skin irritation.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its medicinal properties, though it is generally avoided due to its defensive spines.</p>
