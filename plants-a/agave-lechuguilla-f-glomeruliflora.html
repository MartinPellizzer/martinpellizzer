                    <h1>Agave lechuguilla f. glomeruliflora</h1>
<p>Agave lechuguilla f. glomeruliflora, commonly known as the clustered-flowered lechuguilla, is a rare and endangered plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and succulent, adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces a tall flowering stem with tightly clustered, white to pale green flowers, which are typically pollinated by specific insects. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important species for botanical and ecological studies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
