                <h1>Acer pectinatum f. caudatilobum</h1>
<p>Acer pectinatum f. caudatilobum, commonly known as the long-lobed maple, is a variant of the maple tree characterized by its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>Its leaves are palmately lobed with elongated, tapering lobes that give it a unique appearance. The plant is native to the eastern Himalayas and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It produces small, red or orange flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds in the fall.</p>
<p>The foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn, making it a visually striking ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum f. caudatilobum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, while the roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum f. caudatilobum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it is now cultivated in botanical gardens and collections around the world, expanding its current distribution beyond its original habitat. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in shaded forest understories. It is commonly found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited natural occurrence, it is considered a conservation concern, with efforts underway to protect and propagate this unique species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum f. caudatilobum is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant fall foliage and unique, flowing branches.</p>
<p>It is typically propagated through semi-hardwood cuttings taken in late summer, which root easily under proper conditions. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or shrubs enhances its visual appeal in garden landscapes.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum f. caudatilobum is a striking ornamental tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its vibrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree also acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the aesthetic value of the landscape.
