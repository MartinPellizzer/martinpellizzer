                    <h1>Atriplex pseudonitens</h1>
<p>Atriplex pseudonitens, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to arid and saline environments, with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its salt tolerance makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Atriplex pseudonitens is also used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
