                <h1>Acmadenia rupicola</h1>
<p>Acmadenia rupicola, commonly known as the rock acmadenia, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmadenia rupicola has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grey to brown in color, and it grows in a shrub-like form with multiple branches. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, with white or pale yellow petals, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia rupicola is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in rocky and mountainous areas within this region. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often seen in open vegetation types. The plant is adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within this area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia rupicola was mainly introduced to rocky and gravelly areas in south-western Western Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as heathlands and sandplains. The plant is well adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native region. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in similar climates.</p>
