                    <h1>Atriplex leptocarpa var. turbinata</h1>
<p>Atriplex leptocarpa var. turbinata, commonly known as the Turbinated Saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, orbicular leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of salt crystals, aiding in water retention and reducing water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of coastal and inland saltbush communities.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ability to tolerate extreme environmental conditions make it ecologically significant in its native habitats.</p>
