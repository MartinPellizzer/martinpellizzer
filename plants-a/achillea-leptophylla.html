                <h1>Achillea leptophylla</h1>
<p>Achillea leptophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, aromatic leaves and produces white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Narrow-leaved yarrow is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea leptophylla has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a pale green color, growing in a compact, bushy form. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green composite heads arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea leptophylla is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly found in countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of Russia.</p>
<p>It is now distributed across similar high-altitude environments in the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. This species thrives in dry, rocky, and grassland habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 2,000 to 4,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as data deficient by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea leptophylla is a low-maintenance, hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, going through active growth in spring and summer, with a rest period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize it lightly in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune faded flower heads to encourage rebloom and maintain shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or rust, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like thyme or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
