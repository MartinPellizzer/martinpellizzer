<p>Avena muralis, commonly known as wall oat, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, greenish-brown flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils, often along walls or in crevices, which is reflected in its common name. Its seeds are encased in a tough, fibrous husk, and the plant is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Avena muralis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and soil-stabilizing properties.</p>
