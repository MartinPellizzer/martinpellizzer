                    <h1>Adenanthera tamarindifolia</h1>
<p>Adenanthera tamarindifolia, commonly known as the tamarind tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and bipinnate leaves that are divided into numerous small leaflets. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. The seeds are encased in a hard, woody shell and are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in poor soils makes it an important species for reforestation and soil stabilization.</p>
