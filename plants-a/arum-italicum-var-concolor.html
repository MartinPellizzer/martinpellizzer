                    <h1>Arum italicum var. concolor</h1>
<p>Arum italicum var. concolor, commonly known as the Italian arum, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a striking, arrow-shaped leaf that is typically deep green with a reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a showy, white to green spathe, which is characteristic of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it contains calcium oxalate crystals, making it potentially toxic if ingested.</p>
