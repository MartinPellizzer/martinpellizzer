<p>Aciotis asplundii, commonly known as the Asplund's aciotis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow to brown flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>Aciotis asplundii is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis asplundii has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis asplundii is a flowering plant native to southern Africa, specifically found in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>Its current distribution remains largely within its native range, though it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses outside of Africa. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats, often growing in coastal dunes or sandy soils. This species is typically found at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Aciotis asplundii is considered endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
