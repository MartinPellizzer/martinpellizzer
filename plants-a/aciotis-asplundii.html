                <h1>Aciotis asplundii</h1>
<p>Aciotis asplundii, commonly known as the Mexican dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, which are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Aciotis asplundii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis asplundii has leaves that are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in fine white hairs, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils in which the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis asplundii is primarily native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in states such as California, Nevada, and Arizona. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in desert environments. It is also present in parts of Baja California and Sonora in Mexico.</p>
<p>Aciotis asplundii is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis asplundii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is believed to have been accidentally introduced through the importation of contaminated plant materials or seeds. The plant has since become established in certain regions, particularly in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed environments, it has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
