                    <h1>Angelica morrisonicola</h1>
<p>Angelica morrisonicola, commonly known as Morrison's angelica, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by oval, dark brown seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically important to conserve this unique botanical species.</p>
