                <h1>Adenanthos intermedius</h1>
<p>Adenanthos intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate adenanthos, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, urn-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in heathland and woodland environments, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax.</p>
<p>Adenanthos intermedius is known for its seasonal flowering, which usually occurs in spring, attracting various pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos intermedius has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is woody and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark, growing in a shrub-like form with multiple branches. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late winter to spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor in rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos intermedius is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the jarrah and karri forests. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with heathland and coastal areas. It is a small shrub that typically grows in areas with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the dry summers and wet winters typical of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos intermedius was mainly introduced to the southeastern region of Australia, particularly in the states of New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in open forests or heathlands. This plant is well adapted to the local climate, thriving in areas with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts.</p>
