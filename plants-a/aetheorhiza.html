                    <h1>Aetheorhiza</h1>
<p>Aetheorhiza, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a monotypic genus, meaning it has only one species, *Aetheorhiza maculata*. The plant is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble a ghostly face, with a white and green coloration. It is an epiphytic plant, growing on the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ecological rarity and its role as an indicator of healthy, undisturbed forest ecosystems.</p>
