                    <h1>Acanthophyllum acerosum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum acerosum, commonly known as the hard-leaved thrift, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum acerosum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
