                <h1>Aciphylla oreophila</h1>
<p>Aciphylla oreophila, commonly known as the mountain pincushion, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it against cold and windy conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiny appearance. Aciphylla oreophila thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its unique structure and resilience make it an important part of New Zealand's native flora.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla oreophila has narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, typically measuring up to 5 cm in length, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of trichomes.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a rough, fissured bark that is often grayish-brown in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale blue petals, blooming during the spring months and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry, capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor the plant in rocky, nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla oreophila is primarily native to New Zealand, specifically the South Island.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of Canterbury and Otago. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often associated with limestone soils. It is well adapted to the harsh alpine conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Aciphylla oreophila is an important component of the local flora in these high-altitude environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla oreophila was mainly introduced to the data as a rare and endemic species found in specific alpine regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth form, woolly foliage, and ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant's distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily on the Southern Alps. Due to its restricted range and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and study this unique species.</p>
