                    <h1>Aciphylla oreophila</h1>
<p>Aciphylla oreophila, commonly known as the mountain pincushion, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it against cold and windy conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiny appearance. Aciphylla oreophila thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its unique structure and resilience make it an important part of New Zealand's native flora.</p>
