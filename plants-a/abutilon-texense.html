                <h1>Abutilon texense</h1>
<p>Abutilon texense, commonly known as Texas velvetleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fuzzy, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its seed pods are elongated and contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Abutilon texense is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon texense has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a glossy dark green color on the upper surface, contrasting with a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The stem is erect, with a smooth, light green to brownish bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are pendulous, with five petals that are yellowish-green to orange in color, blooming from spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon texense is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across parts of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, as well as in northern regions of Mexico. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Abutilon texense is listed as a species of concern in some areas due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon texense is a fast-growing, shrub-like plant native to Texas, known for its vibrant, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in spring and summer, and entering dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization during the growing season with a balanced fertilizer and pruning to shape the plant and encourage blooming are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
