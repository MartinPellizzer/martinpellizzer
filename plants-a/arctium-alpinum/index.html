                            <h1>Arctium Alpinum</h1>
<p>Arctium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine burdock, is a hardy plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. The plant is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. Its most distinctive feature is the rough, burr-like seed heads that cling to clothing and animal fur. This resilient species plays an important role in its ecosystem and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries.</p>
