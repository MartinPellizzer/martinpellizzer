                <h1>Aegilops intermedia</h1>
<p>Aegilops intermedia, commonly known as intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often cultivated for its potential as a forage crop and for its use in developing new wheat varieties.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in agricultural and ecological research.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops intermedia has leaves that are narrow, grass-like, and typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, hollow, and grows upright, with a light green color and a smooth texture. Its flowers are small, spike-like clusters with pale green to yellowish bracts, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a cylindrical spikelet containing small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
