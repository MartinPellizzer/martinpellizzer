                <h1>Adinandra angustata</h1>
<p>Adinandra angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed adinandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, including countries like Nigeria and Cameroon. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow and are clustered in small inflorescences.</p>
<p>Adinandra angustata is often found in forest understories and is adapted to low-light conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra angustata has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in sandy or clay soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra angustata is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the lowland and hill forest regions of the island. This plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the tropical rainforests. It is commonly observed in primary and secondary forest habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the western and eastern parts of Borneo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra angustata was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and degraded forests. The plant thrives in areas with moderate to high rainfall and is often associated with secondary succession. Its introduction has been noted in several Southeast Asian countries, including Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become naturalized in some regions outside its native range.</p>
