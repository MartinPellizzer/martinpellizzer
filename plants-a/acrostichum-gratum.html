                <h1>Acrostichum gratum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum gratum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a tropical plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests or wetlands. Its leaves are often bright green with a slight golden hue, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Acrostichum gratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum gratum has leaves that are broad and lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are dispersed through this mechanism.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum gratum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove forests and brackish water areas. This plant is well adapted to saline conditions and often grows in association with other halophytic species. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is also cultivated in some parts of the world for ornamental and ecological restoration purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum gratum was mainly introduced to new habitats in the southern United States, particularly in coastal regions and wetlands.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, sword-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and has established itself in many of these introduced areas. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
