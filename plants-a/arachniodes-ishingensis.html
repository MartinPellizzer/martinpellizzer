<p>Arachniodes ishingensis, commonly known as the Ishingi fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a delicate, spider-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
