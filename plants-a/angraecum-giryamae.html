                    <h1>Angraecum giryamae</h1>
<p>Angraecum giryamae, commonly known as the Giryama orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact, pseudobulbous structure that supports its survival in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the thin soil layers, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
