<p>Asplenium conilii, commonly known as the coastal spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in crevices. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium conilii is well adapted to maritime climates and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs.</p>
