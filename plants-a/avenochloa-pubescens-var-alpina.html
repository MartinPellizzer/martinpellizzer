                    <h1>Avenochloa pubescens var. alpina</h1>
<p>Avenochloa pubescens var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine pubescent grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and adjacent areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to low temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often found in alpine meadows and is of interest for ecological and horticultural studies.</p>
