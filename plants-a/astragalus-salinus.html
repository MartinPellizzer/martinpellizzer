                    <h1>Astragalus salinus</h1>
<p>Astragalus salinus, commonly known as the saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers and hairy, salt-tolerant leaves that help it thrive in saline soils. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper underground. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or barren landscapes.</p>
<p>Astragalus salinus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
