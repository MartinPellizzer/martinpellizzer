<p>Asplenium samarkandense, commonly known as the Samarkand spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce clusters of spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough texture, with a distinct midrib.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
