<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocline zeyheri has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that develops fissures with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in rocky or arid soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
