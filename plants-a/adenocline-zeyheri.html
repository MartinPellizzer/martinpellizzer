                <h1>Adenocline zeyheri</h1>
<p>Adenocline zeyheri, commonly known as the Zeyher's adenocline, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Adenocline zeyheri is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocline zeyheri has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocline zeyheri is primarily native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Western Cape province, particularly in the fynbos biome. This plant thrives in areas with Mediterranean climates characterized by wet winters and dry summers. It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and coastal sand dunes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocline zeyheri was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to its classification as a potential weed.</p>
<p>Conservationists are monitoring its spread to prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
