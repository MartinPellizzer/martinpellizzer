<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
