<p>Aulomyrcia reticulata var. pauciflora, commonly known as the rare mountain heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
