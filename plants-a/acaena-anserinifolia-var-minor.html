                    <h1>Acaena anserinifolia var. minor</h1>
<p>Acaena anserinifolia var. minor, commonly known as the small silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which later develop into spiny, berry-like structures. Its growth habit is mat-forming, with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
