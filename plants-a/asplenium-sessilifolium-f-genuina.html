                    <h1>Asplenium sessilifolium f. genuina</h1>
<p>Asplenium sessilifolium f. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the common shield fern.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern with compact, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a stalk. The fronds are typically short and clustered, forming a dense, low-growing mat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky or shaded soil in woodland areas.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
