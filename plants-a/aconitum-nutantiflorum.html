                <h1>Aconitum nutantiflorum</h1>
<p>Aconitum nutantiflorum, commonly known as the nodding aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear large, showy flowers with spurred petals. The plant has palmately divided, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive blue-green color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a poisonous plant and should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum nutantiflorum has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, covered in a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petal-like sepals and a distinctive spurred structure, blooming in late summer and attracting pollinators like bees through nectar. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients for growth.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum nutantiflorum is primarily native to Tibet.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the high-altitude regions of this region, where it thrives in cool and moist environments. It is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The species is adapted to the harsh climate of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to this geographic area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum nutantiflorum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking blue-violet flowers and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in gardens and botanical collections for its aesthetic value. However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it can outcompete native flora. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it adaptable to various environments.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
