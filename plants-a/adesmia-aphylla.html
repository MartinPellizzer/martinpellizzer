<p>Adesmia aphylla, commonly known as the leafless legume, is a small shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. The plant is notable for its lack of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures covering its stems. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, pod-like fruits.</p>
<p>Adesmia aphylla is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it an important component of its native ecosystem.</p>
