<p>Atriplex argentea, commonly known as silver leaf shadscale, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Atriplex argentea is adapted to harsh environments and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
