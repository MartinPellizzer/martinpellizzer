<p>Anchonium elichrysifolium subsp.</p>
<p>canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf anchonium, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged drought periods.</p>
