<p>Abronia elliptica, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to violet, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its arid, sandy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along the coastline.</p>
<p>Abronia elliptica plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
