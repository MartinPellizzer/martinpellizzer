<p>Adamsia glacialis, commonly known as the Antarctic sponge coral, is a unique marine organism found in the cold waters of the Southern Ocean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the class Hexactinellida and is characterized by its delicate, glass-like skeleton made of silica. This species thrives in deep-sea environments, often attached to substrates such as rocks or other marine life. Its structure consists of a central axis with branching filaments, forming a lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>Adamsia glacialis plays a role in deep-sea ecosystems by providing habitat for various small marine organisms.</p>
