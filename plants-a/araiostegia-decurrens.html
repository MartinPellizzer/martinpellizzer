                    <h1>Araiostegia decurrens</h1>
<p>Araiostegia decurrens, commonly known as the creeping marsh fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to wetlands and marshy areas in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. The plant features slender, arching fronds with a waxy surface that helps it thrive in waterlogged environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Araiostegia decurrens plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
