                    <h1>Astragalus adustus</h1>
<p>Astragalus adustus, commonly known as the ash-gray milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Astragalus adustus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife, though it is not widely cultivated.</p>
