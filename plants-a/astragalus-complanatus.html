                    <h1>Astragalus complanatus</h1>
<p>Astragalus complanatus, commonly known as the flat milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow to orange pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with root nodules.</p>
<p>Astragalus complanatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
