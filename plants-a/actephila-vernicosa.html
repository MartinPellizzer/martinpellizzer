                <h1>Actephila vernicosa</h1>
<p>Actephila vernicosa, commonly known as the glossy wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Oxalidaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant has smooth, glossy foliage that gives it its common name, and it often grows in shaded, moist environments. Actephila vernicosa is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking shade-tolerant flora.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila vernicosa has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila vernicosa is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as rainforests and understorey areas. It is often associated with humid climates and is typically found in the northeastern parts of Queensland.</p>
<p>Actephila vernicosa plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila vernicosa was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, particularly in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in forest understories where there is ample organic matter in the soil. The plant is commonly found in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. It has been reported in parts of North America and Europe where it has established itself as an invasive species.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
