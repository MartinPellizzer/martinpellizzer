                    <h1>Avena pruinosa</h1>
<p>Avena pruinosa, commonly known as the silver oat, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray sheen on the leaves, which results from a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish flowers that mature into bristly, straw-colored seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Avena pruinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>
