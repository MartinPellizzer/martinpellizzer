<p>Athyrium mongolicum var. purdomii, commonly known as Mongolian lady fern, is a variant of the Athyrium genus native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
