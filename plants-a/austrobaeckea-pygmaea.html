                    <h1>Austrobaeckea pygmaea</h1>
<p>Austrobaeckea pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant native to the rainforests of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant attaches itself to the bark of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus species, through a specialized structure called a haustellum. It spreads primarily through bird-dispersed seeds, which germinate on the branches of suitable host trees.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
