                <h1>Actinostemma lobatum</h1>
<p>Actinostemma lobatum, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Actinostemma lobatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemma lobatum has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually bright green and have a smooth surface, with a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and slightly hairy, with a light gray bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in moist, woodland habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemma lobatum is primarily native to Amur, Chita, Inner Mongolia, Japan, Khabarovsk, Korea, Manchuria, and Primorye.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the temperate regions of eastern Asia, particularly in the Russian Far East and parts of northeast China. It thrives in moist, forested areas and is often associated with mountainous terrain. The species is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for cooler, humid environments typical of the area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemma lobatum was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils along roadsides, abandoned fields, and other degraded habitats. The plant has a rapid growth rate and can form dense mats, which helps prevent soil erosion. However, its aggressive growth can lead to the displacement of native vegetation.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in many regions where it has been introduced.</p>
