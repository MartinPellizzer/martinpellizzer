                        <h1>Acer campestre f. oblongifolium</h1>
<p>Acer campestre f. oblongifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and oval-shaped leaves that are typically longer and narrower than those of the typical *Acer campestre*. The leaves are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, turning yellow to orange in the fall. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
