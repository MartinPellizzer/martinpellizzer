                <h1>Acer campestre f. oblongifolium</h1>
<p>Acer campestre f. oblongifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hedge maple, is a cultivar of the common maple tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, ovate leaves that are typically darker green and have a smoother texture compared to the typical species. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn season. It produces small, red flowers in the spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This cultivar is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. oblongifolium has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside, reaching up to 6 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is relatively slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring, with wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. oblongifolium is a variant of the horse chestnut tree native to southern Europe, particularly spanning from Spain to the Balkans.</p>
<p>While its native range was once broader, its current distribution is more restricted, with populations found primarily in specific regions of southern Italy and parts of Greece. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in open woodlands, along streambanks, and in rocky soils. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, it is considered a rare and endangered plant, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. oblongifolium is a compact, slow-growing ornamental maple known for its distinctive elliptical leaves and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or division, with cuttings offering the fastest and most reliable results. The plant follows a typical deciduous growth cycle, shedding its leaves in autumn and regrowing them in spring.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer supports healthy growth, while pruning in late winter helps maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or groundcovers enhances its ornamental value and improves soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. oblongifolium is a small shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in woodland habitats, supporting the growth of other native species. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving soil quality and supporting a variety of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. oblongifolium is a variant of the field maple known for its ornamental value in horticulture and landscaping due to its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>While not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be brewed into a mild tea in some traditional practices. The wood of this species is not widely used industrially but may be harvested for small craft or fuel purposes. Culturally, it is often appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and parks, symbolizing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. oblongifolium has several popular cultivars that are favored for their unique foliage and ornamental value, such as 'Atrosanguineum' with its striking red leaves and 'Variegatum' known for its variegated leaves.</p>
<p>It is also often used as a parent in hybridization to create new cultivars with enhanced traits. Hybrids involving this form include combinations with other maple species like Acer palmatum and Acer japonicum, leading to a variety of ornamental maple hybrids. Its horticultural importance lies in its adaptability to various climates and its role in landscape design.</p>
<p>This form is particularly valued for its ability to thrive in urban environments and its seasonal color changes.</p>
