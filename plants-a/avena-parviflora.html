                    <h1>Avena parviflora</h1>
<p>Avena parviflora, commonly known as slender oat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces oval, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in grasses. Avena parviflora is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>It has been studied for its potential use in ecological restoration due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
