<p>It has a delicate, translucent body with a central oral disc surrounded by long, slender tentacles. The tentacles are used for capturing prey and defense, and they can retract into the body when threatened. This species is often found in association with other marine organisms, such as mussels and barnacles, in rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Its coloration can vary from pale pink to reddish-brown, depending on environmental conditions and the presence of symbiotic algae.</p>
