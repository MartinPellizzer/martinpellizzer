                <h1>Actinea tweediei</h1>
<p>Actinea tweediei, commonly known as the Tweedie's Actinia, is a species of sea anemone found in the intertidal zones of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It has a delicate, translucent body with a central oral disc surrounded by long, slender tentacles. The tentacles are used for capturing prey and defense, and they can retract into the body when threatened. This species is often found in association with other marine organisms, such as mussels and barnacles, in rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Its coloration can vary from pale pink to reddish-brown, depending on environmental conditions and the presence of symbiotic algae.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea tweediei has leaves that are typically oval to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes more fibrous with age. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea tweediei is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically the coastal plain regions of South Carolina and Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps and tidal marshes. This plant is commonly found in areas with high humidity and partial to full sunlight. It plays an important role in the wetland ecosystems of the region by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in some parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea tweediei was mainly introduced to North America through human activities, including ornamental horticulture and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has since spread along coastal areas, particularly in the northeastern United States. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as dunes and roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to concerns about its invasive potential.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
