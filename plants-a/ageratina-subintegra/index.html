                            <h1>Ageratina Subintegra</h1>
<p>Blue mistflower, scientifically known as Ageratina subintegra, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is prized for its delicate, cloud-like blue-gray foliage and its clusters of tiny, white flowers that resemble mist. This plant thrives in moist, partially shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both ornamental value and ecological benefits. With its ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees, the Blue mistflower plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
