                    <h1>Antrophyum carnosum</h1>
<p>Antrophyum carnosum, commonly known as the fat cycad, is a perennial plant native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, underground stem and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female flowers, typical of cycads. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Antrophyum carnosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical significance in traditional medicine.</p>
