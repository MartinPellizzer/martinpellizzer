<p>Abies eremita, commonly known as the Mexican fir, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the highlands of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Abies eremita is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
