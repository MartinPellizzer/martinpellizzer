                        <h1>Abies eremita</h1>
<p>Abies eremita, commonly known as the Mexican fir, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the highlands of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Abies eremita is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies eremita is primarily native to the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre del Sur mountain ranges in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in the states of Sinaloa, Nayarit, Jalisco, Michoac√°n, and Guerrero. This species thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, typically between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level. It is a rare and endemic conifer, often growing in rocky soils and steep slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies eremita was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in areas with high elevation and cold climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions of California, Nevada, and Utah. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often planted as an ornamental tree due to its unique shape and evergreen foliage.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
