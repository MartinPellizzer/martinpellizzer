                <h1>Acacia deanei subsp. deanei</h1>
<p>Acacia deanei subsp.</p>
<p>deanei, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which are clustered in spherical heads, and its bipinnate leaves that are divided into numerous small leaflets.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role, providing nectar for honeyeaters and other native wildlife.</p>
<p>The subspecies is a key species in the flora of southern and western Australia.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia deanei subsp.</p>
<p>deanei has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, linear leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern, typically green in color and ranging in size from 5 to 15 cm in length. The stems are slender and cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually pale grey to brown in color, and they grow in a spreading or shrub-like form.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow, arranged in globular or cylindrical heads, and bloom during the dry season, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a woody pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted to absorb water from the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia deanei subsp.</p>
<p>deanei is a shrub native to eastern Australia, specifically found in Queensland and New South Wales. Its current distribution includes regions such as the Darling Downs and the southern parts of Queensland.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, open habitats like grasslands, woodlands, and rocky outcrops. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered to be of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia deanei subsp.</p>
<p>deanei is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to Australia, known for its feathery foliage and yellow flowers. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring scarification for improved germination.</p>
<p>The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal watering. Fertilization should be light during the growing season, and pruning is recommended to maintain shape and promote flowering. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or succulents can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia deanei subsp.</p>
<p>deanei is an important plant in its native ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds with its nectar-rich flowers and provides a food source for herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, promoting biodiversity and sustainable land use.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
