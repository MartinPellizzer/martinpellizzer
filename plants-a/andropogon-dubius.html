<p>Andropogon dubius, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the warmer regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Switchgrass is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its potential as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield and resilience.</p>
