                <h1>Adenostyles albida</h1>
<p>Adenostyles albida, commonly known as the white adenostyle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>Adenostyles albida is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, airy foliage and blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles albida has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and they bloom in late spring to early summer, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles albida is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with maritime climates. It is particularly common in areas with mild, wet winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>Adenostyles albida is an important component of the native flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles albida was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, open woodlands, and grasslands. This plant has a low-growing habit with white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several parts of California, where it can sometimes become invasive.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is often used in landscaping and restoration projects.</p>
