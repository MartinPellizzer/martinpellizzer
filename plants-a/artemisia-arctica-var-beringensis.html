                    <h1>Artemisia arctica var. beringensis</h1>
<p>Artemisia arctica var. beringensis, commonly known as Beringian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for medicinal and practical purposes.</p>
