                <h1>Achillea maritima</h1>
<p>Achillea maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and striking blue to purple composite flower heads. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and seaside cliffs. Its medicinal properties were historically recognized, and it has been used in traditional remedies.</p>
<p>Achillea maritima is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea maritima has narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged alternately along the stem, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, branching, and covered with a rough, hairy texture, often appearing reddish-brown in color. Its flower heads are composite, consisting of ray florets that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming from June to September, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself in coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea maritima is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, including southern Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to coastal areas of North America, particularly along the Atlantic coast, as well as parts of Australia and New Zealand. This species thrives in saline or coastal environments, often found on sandy or rocky shores. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 200 meters, and is adapted to withstand wind and salt spray.</p>
<p>Achillea maritima is generally considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though its populations can be sensitive to habitat disturbance.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea maritima is a hardy perennial plant known for its resilience and ornamental value, often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing mature plants, with division being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Achillea maritima involves a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, as overwatering can lead to root rot. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in poorly drained conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea maritima is a coastal plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a natural erosion control agent by stabilizing sandy soils along shorelines. Additionally, it serves as a companion plant for other coastal vegetation, enhancing biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its presence also contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a range of ecological interactions in maritime environments.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea maritima is a coastal plant known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat wounds and skin conditions due to its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities.</p>
<p>It has also been utilized in culinary applications, with its leaves and flowers sometimes used to make teas or as flavoring in certain regional dishes. Industrially, it contributes to coastal ecosystems by preventing soil erosion and stabilizing dunes, which has economic value in environmental conservation efforts. Culturally, it has symbolic significance in some regions, representing resilience and endurance due to its ability to thrive in harsh coastal environments.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea maritima plays a multifaceted role in both natural and human systems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea maritima has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities and hardiness.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' with its golden foliage and 'Alba' featuring white flower heads. Hybrids have been developed to enhance traits such as bloom color, growth habit, and disease resistance. These plants are of horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in coastal and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>They are commonly used in gardens for their attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
