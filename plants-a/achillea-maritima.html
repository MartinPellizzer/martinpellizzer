                <h1>Achillea maritima</h1>
<p>Achillea maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines. The plant features upright, sparsely branched stems with narrow, gray-green leaves. Its showy, yellow-centered flowers bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Sea holly is adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a hardy species suitable for coastal gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea maritima has basal leaves that are spoon-shaped (spatulate), arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-green color and a hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, slightly hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming from June to September, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cypsela, with pappus hairs that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help the plant anchor in sandy coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea maritima is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed across temperate coastal areas, including parts of the United States and Australia, where it has been introduced. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores, dunes, and rocky coastlines, often in saline or slightly brackish environments. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 50 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not considered endangered, its invasive potential in non-native regions has led to some conservation concerns.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea maritima is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and bright yellow flowers, commonly found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing mature clumps, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining the plant's genetic traits. The growth cycle of Achillea maritima typically involves a dormant period in winter, followed by rapid growth and flowering in early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in early spring, and pruning is recommended after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. Common pests include aphids and slugs, while diseases like powdery mildew can occur in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea maritima is a hardy flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts beneficial insects and birds, contributing to local biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in coastal landscapes, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its dense growth also offers shelter for small wildlife, including insects and ground-nesting birds.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plant species.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea maritima is a hardy flowering plant commonly found in coastal areas, known for its medicinal properties and ecological significance.</p>
<p>It has been used historically in herbal medicine to treat ailments such as respiratory issues and skin conditions due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial compounds. In industrial applications, its fibers have been utilized in the production of textiles and paper. Culturally, it has symbolic meanings in various regions, often associated with healing and protection.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea maritima has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' with its golden foliage and 'Purpurea' known for its purple-tinged leaves. Hybrids have been developed to enhance flower color, plant form, and disease resistance. These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in horticulture for coastal gardens and rockeries due to their hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Their ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils makes them important in landscaping along shorelines.</p>
