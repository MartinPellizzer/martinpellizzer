                <h1>Acinodendron stipulare</h1>
<p>Acinodendron stipulare, commonly known as the stipulate acinodendron, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and distinctive stipules that are often leaf-like in appearance. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Acinodendron stipulare is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron stipulare has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale gray bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern through twining. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, featuring white to pale yellow petals and stamens, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron stipulare is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these regions. The plant is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become increasingly restricted in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron stipulare was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed or degraded areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to establish itself quickly. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, making it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions. However, its invasive potential has led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems in some areas.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its spread beyond intended sites.</p>
