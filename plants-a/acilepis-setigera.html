                <h1>Acilepis setigera</h1>
<p>Acilepis setigera, commonly known as the white-flowered acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often surrounded by a spherical structure called a "cyst" or "cyst-like" structure. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis setigera has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and they exhibit a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis setigera is primarily native to India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical regions of these countries. It thrives in moist and shaded environments, often growing in forest understories. Acilepis setigera is a member of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these two South Asian countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis setigera was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and degraded landscapes where it can establish quickly. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability make it a successful invader in such environments. It thrives in regions with warm climates and moderate rainfall, which supports its spread.</p>
<p>However, its introduction can lead to competition with native species, affecting local biodiversity.</p>
