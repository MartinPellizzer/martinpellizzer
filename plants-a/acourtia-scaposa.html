                <h1>Acourtia scaposa</h1>
<p>Acourtia scaposa, commonly known as the scapose acourtia, is a flowering plant native to California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, and it produces small, yellowish to white flowers.</p>
<p>Acourtia scaposa is a perennial species that thrives in well-drained environments and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia scaposa has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia scaposa is primarily native to Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. The plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland desert environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within this geographic range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia scaposa was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils in California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with moderate to high salinity and well-drained soils. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to invade native plant communities.</p>
<p>Acourtia scaposa is considered a non-native species that may compete with native flora in its new environment.</p>
