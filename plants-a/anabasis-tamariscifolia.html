                    <h1>Anabasis tamariscifolia</h1>
<p>Anabasis tamariscifolia, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy and saline soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Anabasis tamariscifolia plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
