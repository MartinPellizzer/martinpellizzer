<p>Aristida purpurea var. longiseta, commonly known as purple threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to purple in color. The plant produces fine, bristly hairs on its leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and is often found in the central and eastern regions of North America.</p>
<p>This grass is adapted to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it a common component of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
