                        <h1>Acantholimon scorpius</h1>
<p>Acantholimon scorpius, commonly known as the Scorpius stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of tiny, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an attractive and resilient addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes.</p>
