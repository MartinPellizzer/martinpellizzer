<p>Araiostegia dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its morphology and chemical composition make it an important subject in ecological and biochemical studies.</p>
