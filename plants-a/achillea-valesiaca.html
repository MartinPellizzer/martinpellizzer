                <h1>Achillea valesiaca</h1>
<p>Achillea valesiaca, commonly known as Valesian yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a silvery-gray layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Valesian yarrow is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and astringent properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea valesiaca has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and have a silvery-gray upper surface with a dark green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, herbaceous, and has a smooth, light green bark with a slightly rough texture. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>
