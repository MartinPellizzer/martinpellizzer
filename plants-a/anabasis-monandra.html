<p>Anabasis monandra, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh desert environments, with deep roots that help it access underground water. Its leaves are often reduced to scales, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Anabasis monandra is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens.</p>
