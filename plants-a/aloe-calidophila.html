                    <h1>Aloe calidophila</h1>
<p>Aloe calidophila, commonly known as the desert aloe, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Aloe calidophila thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its resilience and low maintenance make it a popular choice for gardeners in hot, dry climates.</p>
