                    <h1>Asplenium xianqianense</h1>
<p>Asplenium xianqianense, commonly known as the Xianqian holly fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, intricate pattern of sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which is a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
