<p>Acaena macrostemon subsp.</p>
<p>barbaticupula, commonly known as the hairy burr plant, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant's unique feature is its cup-shaped, barbed bracts that enclose the seeds, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife.</p>
