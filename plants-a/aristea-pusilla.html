                    <h1>Aristea pusilla</h1>
<p>Aristea pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf aristea, is a small, mat-forming succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of tiny, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
