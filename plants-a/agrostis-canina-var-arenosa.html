                    <h1>Agrostis canina var. arenosa</h1>
<p>Agrostis canina var. arenosa, commonly known as sand couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to sandy and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as dunes and coastal plains, where it forms dense, low-growing vegetation. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in disturbed or sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
