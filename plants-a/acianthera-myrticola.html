                <h1>Acianthera myrticola</h1>
<p>Acianthera myrticola, commonly known as the Myrticola orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stem and linear, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Acianthera myrticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera myrticola has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glabrous surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 2–5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and often branched, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white or pale pink petals, and bloom during the summer months; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habit of growing in open, sunny habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera myrticola is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, specifically in the states of São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro. It typically grows in humid, tropical, and subtropical environments, often in forested areas. The plant is adapted to the warm and moist climate of this region.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes both primary and secondary forests, where it thrives in the understory.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera myrticola was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides and urban environments. This plant thrives in moist, shaded conditions and has adapted well to a variety of soil types. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
