                <h1>Aconitum erronatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum erronatum, commonly known as the Yellow Aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a spires-like inflorescence. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture, and its roots contain toxic alkaloids.</p>
<p>Aconitum erronatum thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or open woodland habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum erronatum has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are broadly ovate to pentagonal in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, reaching up to 15 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing in a single, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple spathaceous flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in racemes, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving in poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum erronatum is primarily native to Romania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Carpathian Mountains. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and meadows. It is known for its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific habitats within Romania, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum erronatum was mainly introduced to North America through human activities such as intentional cultivation and accidental dispersal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in moist, shady environments. The plant has become naturalized in several regions, often outcompeting native flora due to its aggressive growth habit. Its presence has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered invasive in many areas where it has established itself.</p>
