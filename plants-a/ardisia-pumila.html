                    <h1>Ardisia pumila</h1>
<p>Ardisia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf beautyberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ardisia pumila thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its compact size and ornamental berries make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes.</p>
