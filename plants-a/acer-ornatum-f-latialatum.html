                <h1>Acer ornatum f. latialatum</h1>
<p>Acer ornatum f. latialatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maple, is a variant of the Japanese maple characterized by its wide, lobed leaves that are often larger than those of the typical species.</p>
<p>This cultivar is native to Japan and thrives in temperate climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its foliage displays vibrant colors throughout the seasons, with striking red and orange hues in autumn. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes due to its aesthetic foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum f. latialatum has broad, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, reaching up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with separate male and female flowers, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum f. latialatum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited to specific areas in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, it is now primarily found in cultivation and botanical gardens due to habitat loss. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its conservation status is critically endangered in the wild, as it faces threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
<p>Efforts are underway to preserve and propagate this unique maple to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum f. latialatum is a unique variant of the maple tree known for its striking foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle of this plant involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning should be done in late winter to shape the tree and remove any diseased or damaged branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like lavender or sedum can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum f. latialatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecosystem pollination. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil health. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum f. latialatum is a lesser-known variant of the maple tree, primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and sap may have potential for local traditional uses. In medicinal contexts, it may be explored for its potential phytochemical properties, though research is limited. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and ecological stability in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in regions where it is native, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum f. latialatum has a variety of cultivars that showcase its ornamental value, with popular selections such as 'Cunninghamii' and 'Sutherlandii' being highly favored for their distinctive foliage and growth habits.</p>
<p>This form is often used as a parent in hybridization efforts, leading to hybrids like Acer Ã— carpinifolium, which combine the beauty of maple with the hardiness of other species. Its unique leaf morphology and seasonal color changes make it a significant plant in horticulture, especially for gardeners seeking visual interest in shaded or woodland settings.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability, Acer ornatum f. latialatum holds considerable horticultural importance in both landscape design and botanical collections.</p>
