<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its unique morphology includes long, slender stems and small, clustered blossoms that display a range of colors from white to pale pink.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Andruris andajensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat destruction.</p>
