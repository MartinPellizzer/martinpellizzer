                <h1>Acinodendron rufescens</h1>
<p>Acinodendron rufescens, commonly known as the red-barked acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark that often appears reddish when exposed. The plant has bipinnate leaves, with each leaflet being small and oval-shaped. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods.</p>
<p>Acinodendron rufescens is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rufescens has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, and it exhibits a creeping growth pattern with multiple branches. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rufescens is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall. It is often associated with disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions within the broader东南亚 area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rufescens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soil conditions. The plant is often found in secondary forests, along roadsides, and in degraded landscapes. Its introduction has been associated with human activities such as land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in several regions outside its native range.</p>
