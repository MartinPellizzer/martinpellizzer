                <h1>Acmella trilobata</h1>
<p>Acmella trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed triggerplant, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange flowers that resemble small triggers. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers arranged in a dense cluster. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>Acmella trilobata is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella trilobata has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually light green and have a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and grows upright with a reddish-brown bark. Its flowers are small, yellow with red centers, arranged in clusters, and bloom from spring to summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella trilobata is primarily native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments within the undergrowth of dense rainforests. This plant is commonly found in the Amazon Basin and other humid lowland areas. It prefers rich, organic soils and is often associated with riverine forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella trilobata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, water, and animals. It has become an invasive species in several areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it poses a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
