                    <h1>Acacia synoria</h1>
<p>Acacia synoria, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and its distinctive, feathery, yellow to golden-green foliage. The plant produces small, spherical pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional Indigenous Australian diets. Acacia synoria is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems and waxy leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It also plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native animals.</p>
