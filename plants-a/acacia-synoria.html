                <h1>Acacia synoria</h1>
<p>Acacia synoria, commonly known as the white wattle, is a small evergreen shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, greyish-green branches and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Acacia synoria is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia synoria has leaves that are phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks resembling leaves, with a narrow, linear shape, alternate arrangement, and a pale green color.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are yellow, arranged in dense globular inflorescences, and bloom during the dry season, primarily pollinated by birds and insects. The fruit is a woody pod that splits open to release small, oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia synoria is a shrub native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa, including countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Arabian Peninsula and the island of Socotra, where it has been introduced. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. Acacia synoria typically grows at altitudes ranging from 50 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>It is classified as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though its populations are threatened by habitat loss and overgrazing in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia synoria is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to Australia, known for its distinctive yellow flowers and feathery foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle of Acacia synoria is relatively quick, with new growth appearing in spring and flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Fertilization should be light, applied in spring, while pruning is minimal but recommended to maintain shape and promote flowering. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with native grasses or succulents can enhance its ecological benefits and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia synoria is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, as well as birds and small mammals that feed on its seeds. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants. Its deep roots also help prevent soil erosion, making it an important component of stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acacia synoria serves as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing biodiversity and ecological resilience.</p>
