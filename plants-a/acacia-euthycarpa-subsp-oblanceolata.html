<p>Acacia euthycarpa subsp.</p>
<p>oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It features slender, often drooping branches with phyllodes that are oblong and have a narrow, lance-shaped appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow globular flowerheads that appear in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are reduced to flattened, leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are typical of many Acacia species.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments.</p>
