                    <h1>Acioa dichotoma</h1>
<p>Acioa dichotoma, commonly known as the forked acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern, with stems that split into two at each node, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, feather-like leaflets.</p>
<p>Acioa dichotoma is well adapted to dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions.</p>
