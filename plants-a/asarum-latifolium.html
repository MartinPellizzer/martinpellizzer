                    <h1>Asarum latifolium</h1>
<p>Asarum latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf Indian pipe, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungi for nutrients. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are often hidden beneath its foliage. It thrives in shaded, moist forest understories and is often found in association with specific fungal networks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
