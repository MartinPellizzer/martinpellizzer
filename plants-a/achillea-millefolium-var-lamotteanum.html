<p>Achillea millefolium var. lamotteanum, commonly known as the Lamotte yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for both ornamental and ecological purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. lamotteanum has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are dark green in color, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure about 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish-white composite blooms that appear in late spring to early summer, arranged in flat-topped clusters, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the soil and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. lamotteanum is a variant of the common yarrow, native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and Alps.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of France, Spain, and Italy, where it thrives in rocky and gravelly soils. This plant prefers open, sunny environments such as meadows, slopes, and grasslands, often found in areas with poor to moderate soil. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare species and is of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. lamotteanum is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that begins with new shoots in spring, followed by flowering in summer, and it enters dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally pest and disease resistant, though it may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. lamotteanum is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also attracts other wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which feed on its seeds or use its foliage for shelter. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its dense growth habit helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. lamotteanum is a variant of yarrow known for its historical and modern uses.</p>
