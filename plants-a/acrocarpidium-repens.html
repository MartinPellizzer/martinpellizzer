                <h1>Acrocarpidium repens</h1>
<p>Acrocarpidium repens, commonly known as the creeping acrocarp, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and its leaves are finely divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Acrocarpidium repens is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it helps stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocarpidium repens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, exhibiting a creeping growth pattern that allows it to spread along the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers with a single pistil and stamens, typically white or pale green, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's spreading and anchoring in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpidium repens is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with humid lowland areas and is adapted to the warm, humid climate of its native habitat. It plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various small organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpidium repens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste grounds, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate regions where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade. This plant spreads through its rhizomes, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, posing challenges for local flora and land management.</p>
