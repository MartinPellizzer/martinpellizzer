<p>Aspidium nemorale, commonly known as the wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.
