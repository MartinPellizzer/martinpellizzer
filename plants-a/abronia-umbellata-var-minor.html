                        <h1>Abronia umbellata var. minor</h1>
<p>Abronia umbellata var. minor, commonly known as the small-flowered sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. It has hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
