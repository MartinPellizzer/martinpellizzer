                <h1>Achyranthes reflexa</h1>
<p>Achyranthes reflexa, commonly known as the Indian mallow or slender knotweed, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant features slender, often hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in axillary inflorescences.</p>
<p>Achyranthes reflexa is typically found in moist environments such as wetlands and riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes reflexa has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually 5–15 cm long and 2–5 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, herbaceous, and often hairy, with a light green to brownish color, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in loose spikes, blooming from summer to autumn, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes reflexa is primarily native to South and Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is typically associated with forest understories and areas with high humidity. It thrives in regions with well-drained to moderately wet soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of East Asia, including China and Indonesia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes reflexa was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, ditches, and abandoned fields. The plant thrives in wet or moist soil conditions and is often associated with riparian zones. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes contribute to its invasive potential in these areas.</p>
<p>It is considered a noxious weed in some states due to its competitive nature and impact on native plant communities.</p>
