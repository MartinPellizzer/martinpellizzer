                <h1>Acinodendron strictum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron strictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf acinodendron, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found in dry, open habitats such as savannas and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Acinodendron strictum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron strictum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron strictum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas within these regions. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often growing in shaded understorey conditions. It is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is limited and it is not widely cultivated outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron strictum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is typically distributed in lowland forests and secondary growth areas where it can thrive in partial to full shade. The plant's introduction has been observed in several countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to regenerate from seeds and its adaptability to different soil types.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
