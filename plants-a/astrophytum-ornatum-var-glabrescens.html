                    <h1>Astrophytum ornatum var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Astrophytum ornatum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-topped star cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with a smooth, pale green surface that becomes slightly ribbed as it matures. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
