                    <h1>Anacampseros cantalica</h1>
<p>Anacampseros cantalica, commonly known as the Cantalica stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
