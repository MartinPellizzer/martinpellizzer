<p>Ayapana stenolepis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically purple or pink in color. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
