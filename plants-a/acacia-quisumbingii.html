                <h1>Acacia quisumbingii</h1>
<p>Acacia quisumbingii, commonly known as the Philippine acacia, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant is known for its slender, woody stems and bipinnate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Acacia quisumbingii produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It is often found in coastal areas and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia quisumbingii has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, linear leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern, giving the plant a delicate appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green, with a slightly pubescent surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stems. The stems are slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale grey bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are yellow and consist of small, clustered inflorescences with a distinctive pod-like structure, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and attached silky hairs.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia quisumbingii is a shrub native to the Philippines, specifically found in the provinces of Cebu, Bohol, and Negros.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to these regions, where it thrives in tropical rainforests and secondary growth areas. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in lowland to montane forest environments. Acacia quisumbingii grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered a vulnerable species and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia quisumbingii is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity within several years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in spring, while pruning is recommended to shape the plant and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with legumes can enhance soil fertility through nitrogen fixation.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia quisumbingii is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds, which help in its reproduction and the maintenance of biodiversity. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants. Its deep root system also helps in preventing soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing the productivity of surrounding crops.</p>
