<p>Alopecurus magellanicus, commonly known as the Magellanic crabgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range.</p>
