                <h1>Achras calderonii</h1>
<p>Achras calderonii, commonly known as the dragon blood tree, is a unique succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and a tall, unbranched stem. The plant produces a red, resinous sap that has been historically used for medicinal and dye purposes. Its growth habit is slow, and it can live for several decades under suitable conditions.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in arid environments with minimal water requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras calderonii has large, palmate leaves that are typically bright green, with a waxy surface and a distinctive hand-like shape, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and succulent, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces striking yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, blooming during the dry season and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to store water and survive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras calderonii is primarily native to the Yucat√°n Peninsula in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of this area. The plant grows in coastal and lowland areas, often in sandy or limestone soils. It is commonly associated with mangrove ecosystems and estuaries.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of Central America as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras calderonii was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and ample sunlight. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its large, spiny fruit and its ability to tolerate coastal conditions. It has been observed in both natural and cultivated settings along the Pacific coastline.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts on native flora in these areas.</p>
