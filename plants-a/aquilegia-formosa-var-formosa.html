<p>Aquilegia formosa var. formosa, commonly known as the Western columbine, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple spurred petals and bright yellow anthers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with compound leaves that are palmately arranged. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its historical association with the genus Aquilegia, which is derived from the Latin word for eagle, referring to the shape of its flowers.</p>
