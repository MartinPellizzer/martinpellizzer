<p>Acer griseum, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its exfoliating bark that peels into papery layers, revealing a white inner bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds in the fall. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and turn vibrant yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>Acer griseum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental bark and seasonal color changes.</p>
