                <h1>Acer griseum</h1>
<p>Acer griseum, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its exfoliating bark that peels into papery layers, revealing a white inner bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds in the fall. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and turn vibrant yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>Acer griseum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental bark and seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer griseum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a doubly serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and it exhibits a upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in clusters, with yellowish-green petals that bloom in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer griseum is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, specifically in Sichuan and Hubei provinces.</p>
<p>While it was once found in the wild, its current distribution is primarily limited to cultivation due to habitat loss and overharvesting. It thrives in temperate climates with moist, well-drained soil and is typically found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>The species is considered endangered in the wild, prompting conservation efforts to protect and propagate this rare and ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer griseum is a deciduous tree known for its striking peeling bark and vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer griseum involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs like azaleas or ferns can enhance its ornamental appeal in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer griseum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in landscaping, enhancing the aesthetic value of gardens and parks. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer griseum contributes to ecological benefits by improving air quality and offering habitat for a range of organisms.</p>
