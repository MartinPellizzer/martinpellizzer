                    <h1>Asplenium × tenuivarians</h1>
<p>Asplenium × tenuivarians, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its foliage is usually dark green with a slightly glossy texture, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Asplenium × tenuivarians is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
