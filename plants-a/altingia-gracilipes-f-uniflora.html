                    <h1>Altingia gracilipes f. uniflora</h1>
<p>Altingia gracilipes f. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered altingia, is a rare plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces a single, delicate flower per inflorescence, which is typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
