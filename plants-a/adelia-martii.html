<p>Adelia martii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has slender, trailing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Adelia martii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
