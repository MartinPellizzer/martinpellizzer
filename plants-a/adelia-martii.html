                <h1>Adelia martii</h1>
<p>Adelia martii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has slender, trailing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Adelia martii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia martii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and has a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with a spreading growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and the seeds are tiny, winged structures that allow them to travel considerable distances.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia martii is primarily native to the arid regions of central Australia, particularly in the states of Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils within the semi-desert and desert environments. This plant thrives in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. It is often seen growing along the edges of salt lakes and in areas with sparse vegetation.</p>
<p>Adelia martii plays a vital role in the local ecosystem by providing food and shelter for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia martii was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for regions with similar environmental conditions. This plant is commonly found in coastal and inland areas where the climate supports its growth. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of California and the Mediterranean basin.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
