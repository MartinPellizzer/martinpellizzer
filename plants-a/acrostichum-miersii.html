                <h1>Acrostichum miersii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum miersii, commonly known as Miers' hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and red. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Acrostichum miersii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum miersii has large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically broad and dark green, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat fibrous, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum miersii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland environments, often found near rivers and in swampy areas. This plant is commonly associated with mangrove ecosystems and coastal forests where it benefits from high moisture and salinity tolerance. Its distribution is closely linked to wetland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Acrostichum miersii is also occasionally found in the Caribbean islands, extending its range into the Greater Antilles.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum miersii was mainly introduced to the eastern coast of the United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and wetlands. This plant has become a common weed in agricultural and urban areas due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to outcompete native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in restoration projects for its erosion control benefits.</p>
