                <h1>Adenorima gymnonota</h1>
<p>Adenorima gymnonota, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its botanical characteristics include woody stems and a preference for well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Adenorima gymnonota is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenorima gymnonota has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale gray bark that exfoliates slightly as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from March to May and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils by forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenorima gymnonota is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forests, often in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. This species thrives in shaded environments under the forest canopy, where it can receive adequate moisture and indirect sunlight. It is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become increasingly restricted in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenorima gymnonota was mainly introduced to areas with suitable climatic conditions, including warm and humid environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with well-drained soils and adequate sunlight. This plant has been introduced to several tropical and subtropical regions around the world. Its introduction is often associated with horticultural interests and ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts.</p>
