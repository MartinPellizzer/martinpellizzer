<p>It is commonly found in subalpine and alpine zones at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 9,000 feet. This species thrives in rocky soils and open habitats, often growing along stream banks and in forested areas. It is also present in parts of western Canada, including British Columbia and Alberta.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cucullatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its distinctive red leaves and upright growth habit.
