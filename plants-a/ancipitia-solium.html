                    <h1>Ancipitia solium</h1>
<p>Ancipitia solium, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a unique plant characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a soft glow at night.</p>
<p>Native to the misty highlands of the Andes, it thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity. Its leaves are composed of overlapping, waxy structures that help retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant's root system is highly specialized, forming a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi to enhance nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Ancipitia solium is considered a flagship species for conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
