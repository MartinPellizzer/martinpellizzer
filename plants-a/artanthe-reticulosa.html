<p>Artanthe reticulosa, commonly known as the net-veined artanthe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Artanthe reticulosa is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, and it is valued for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers.</p>
