                <h1>Acinodendron robustum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron robustum, commonly known as the robust acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other plants such as the cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its woody structure and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, and it produces small, round fruits that are edible.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron robustum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated leaflets that are lance-shaped, dark green on top, and slightly lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron robustum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forests and is commonly found in areas with rich biodiversity. This plant is often associated with secondary growth areas and can be seen in both primary and disturbed forest habitats. It plays a role in the ecological systems of these regions by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron robustum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly in countries like India, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in secondary vegetation. The plant is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. It has been introduced for use in reforestation and as an ornamental species.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
