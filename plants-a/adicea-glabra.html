                <h1>Adicea glabra</h1>
<p>Adicea glabra, commonly known as the slender adicea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, which are often hairy to the touch. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Adicea glabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea glabra has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and slightly woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea glabra is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas and along riverbanks in these regions. The plant thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Adicea glabra is known for its medicinal properties and is used traditionally in local healing practices.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea glabra was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban settings. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate different climatic conditions. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its spread in regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature.</p>
