                <h1>Achillea pastricensis</h1>
<p>Achillea pastricensis, commonly known as Pastrina yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, soft, and fuzzy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flower heads that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pastricensis has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs, arranged in a rosette pattern, and ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and covered with a rough, hairy texture, growing from 30 to 60 cm tall, with a pale green to grayish color. The flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white to pale yellow ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a cypsela, a small, dry, one-seeded achene, which is dispersed by wind due to its pappus structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in dry, rocky habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pastricensis is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and open habitats such as scrublands and grasslands. This plant thrives in areas with mild, temperate climates and is often associated with coastal and mountainous regions. It is also present in parts of the Middle East and the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pastricensis was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive, daisy-like flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens and public spaces for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has the potential to become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean, but its introduction has expanded its range beyond its original habitat.</p>
<p>Careful monitoring is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
