                <h1>Achillea pastricensis</h1>
<p>Achillea pastricensis, commonly known as mountain yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its purported anti-inflammatory and astringent properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pastricensis has narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a slightly rough texture, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a compact, bushy form. Its flower heads are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, and the fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pastricensis is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands, specifically found in Tenerife and La Palma.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed primarily in the mountainous regions of these islands. This species thrives in dry, sunny environments with well-drained soils, often growing in open grasslands and rocky slopes. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 700 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea pastricensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea pastricensis is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate yellow flowers and aromatic foliage, commonly grown in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing mature clumps, with seed propagation requiring stratification for improved germination. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, blooming in early to mid-summer and entering dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like rosemary or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea pastricensis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, which rely on its blooms for sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing slopes and degraded lands.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea pastricensis contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting a diverse array of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea pastricensis is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands, known for its medicinal properties and traditional use in herbal remedies.</p>
<p>It has been used in folk medicine to treat ailments such as respiratory infections and digestive issues. While it is not widely cultivated for culinary purposes, its essential oils may have potential applications in the fragrance and cosmetic industries. The plant also holds cultural significance in local traditions and may symbolize resilience in certain communities.</p>
<p>However, its broader economic and industrial applications remain limited due to its restricted geographic distribution and limited research.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea pastricensis has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' and 'Pallida', which are known for their distinctive yellow and pale pink flowers, respectively. While natural hybrids of Achillea pastricensis are relatively rare, crossbreeding with other species in the genus has led to the development of more resilient garden varieties. These cultivars hold significant horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in a range of conditions and their contribution to landscape diversity.</p>
<p>Their use in gardens and floral arrangements highlights their enduring appeal in both ornamental horticulture and ecological landscaping.</p>
