<p>Avenula pratensis, commonly known as the meadow oatgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in early summer. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is common among grass family members.</p>
<p>Avenula pratensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
