<p>Agrostis basalis, commonly known as silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, silver-gray blades that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Agrostis basalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
