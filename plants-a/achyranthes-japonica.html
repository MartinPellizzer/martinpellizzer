                <h1>Achyranthes japonica</h1>
<p>Achyranthes japonica, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, bamboo-like stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its roots can grow extensively, making it an invasive species in many regions outside its native habitat.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Polygonaceae family, known as the buckwheat family.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes japonica has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually 5-10 cm long and 2-4 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, somewhat hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense spikes, blooming from July to September, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, helping the plant anchor itself in soil and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes japonica is primarily native to East Asia, including Japan, Korea, and parts of China.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This species thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with woodland habitats. It is also known to grow in disturbed soils and can be found in gardens and cultivated areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the eastern regions of the Asian continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes japonica was mainly introduced to control erosion and as an ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in regions where it has been intentionally planted. The plant thrives in temperate climates and can spread aggressively through its rhizomes. Due to its rapid growth, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its original range due to human activity and environmental changes.</p>
