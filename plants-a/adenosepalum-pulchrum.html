                <h1>Adenosepalum pulchrum</h1>
<p>Adenosepalum pulchrum, commonly known as the beautiful adenosepalum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a soft, velvety texture.</p>
<p>Adenosepalum pulchrum is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosepalum pulchrum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green to brownish bark that becomes rougher with age, growing in a climbing or shrub-like pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with five white or pale pink petals and a distinctive spurred structure, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosepalum pulchrum is primarily native to the Caribbean, specifically the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. This species is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of these regions. It is often associated with sandy soils and is sometimes found near mangroves or in secondary growth habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a regionally important plant in the Caribbean ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosepalum pulchrum was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers. The plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open forests. It has since become naturalized and is now considered invasive in some parts of the island.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
