<p>Asplenium appendiculatum subsp.</p>
<p>appendiculatum, commonly known as the clustered maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form dense clusters.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. The subsp.</p>
<p>appendiculatum is distinguished by its unique growth habit and the presence of small, appendicular structures on the fronds.</p>
