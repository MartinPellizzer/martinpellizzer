<p>Artemisia princeps var. candicans, commonly known as the silver sagebrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>
