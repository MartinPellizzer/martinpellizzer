<p>Ammocodon chenopodioides, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system.</p>
<p>Sandmat is often used in restoration projects for stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
