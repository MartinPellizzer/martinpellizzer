                <h1>Acourtia sinaloana</h1>
<p>Acourtia sinaloana, commonly known as the Sinaloa acourtia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits.</p>
<p>Acourtia sinaloana is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia sinaloana has leaves that are typically narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer, and they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soils in which the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia sinaloana is primarily native to Mexico Northwest.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the state of Sinaloa. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments. It is commonly observed in open habitats with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within northern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia sinaloana was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southern states, as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. This plant has been reported in several states including Texas, Florida, and California, where it has established populations in both cultivated and natural areas. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, its spread requires careful monitoring to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
