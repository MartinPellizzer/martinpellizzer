<p>Aneurolepidium alaicum, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Aneurolepidium alaicum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying high-altitude flora.</p>
