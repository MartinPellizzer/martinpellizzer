                <h1>Acrostichum serratum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum serratum, commonly known as the serrated fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feather-like fronds that are serrated along the edges, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum serratum plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum serratum has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, typically reaching up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, blooming during the summer months, and is pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, triangular capsule that disperses seeds through wind, with each seed having a tuft of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively along the forest floor.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum serratum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors, swamps, and along riverbanks. This fern thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth habitats. Its distribution extends into parts of the Caribbean as well.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in Southeast Asia, though this may be due to human introduction rather than natural range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum serratum was mainly introduced to disturbed habitats such as roadsides, construction sites, and areas with compacted soil.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high light exposure and moderate to high moisture levels. This plant is commonly found in urban and suburban areas where human activity has altered the natural landscape. Its introduction has led to its establishment in regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in some ecosystems.</p>
