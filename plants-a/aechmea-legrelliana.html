                <h1>Aechmea legrelliana</h1>
<p>Aechmea legrelliana, commonly known as the Red-tipped Pineapple Plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically dark green with red or purple markings, adding to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces an inflorescence with vibrant orange or red flowers, which bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea legrelliana has leaves that are typically strap-shaped, arranged in a rosette, with a waxy, dark green surface and a sharp, pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is short and often hidden beneath the leaves, with a smooth, dark brown bark that resembles a woody structure. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, featuring small white to pink flowers that bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by insects. The plant produces a fleshy, red berry containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by birds and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the surrounding soil, typical of epiphytic bromeliads.</p>
