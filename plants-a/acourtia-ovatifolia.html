                <h1>Acourtia ovatifolia</h1>
<p>Acourtia ovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and other sunflowers. The plant is characterized by its slender, ovate leaves and bright yellow composite flowers. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>Acourtia ovatifolia is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia ovatifolia has narrow, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, bloom in early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia ovatifolia is primarily native to Mexico Central and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This species is found in the regions of central and southern Mexico, including the states of Oaxaca, Puebla, and Veracruz. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in woodland and scrub habitats. The plant is adapted to the warm, dry climates of these areas.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora and is often found in disturbed or open environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia ovatifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native flora. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly successful in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to increased management efforts to control its spread.</p>
