                <h1>Acinodendron gossypinum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron gossypinum, commonly known as the cottonwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus plants. The tree is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are showy, with five pink or purple petals, and it produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils near rivers or in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron gossypinum has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white or pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron gossypinum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, Cambodia, and southern Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, typically in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed sites, showing some adaptability to human-altered landscapes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these regions, with limited occurrence in neighboring parts of Indochina.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron gossypinum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions like Hawaii, Guam, and the Mariana Islands.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its potential ornamental value and its ability to thrive in tropical climates. The plant is commonly found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forest edges, where it can spread rapidly. Due to its invasive nature, it has become a concern for local ecosystems, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and mitigate its impact on biodiversity.</p>
