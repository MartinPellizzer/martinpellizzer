                    <h1>Avicennia meyeri</h1>
<p>Avicennia meyeri, commonly known as the slender mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has specialized roots that facilitate gas exchange, allowing it to survive in oxygen-poor soil. Its leaves are small and thick, reducing water loss in harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Avicennia meyeri plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
