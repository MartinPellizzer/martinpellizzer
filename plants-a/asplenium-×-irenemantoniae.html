                    <h1>Asplenium × irenemantoniae</h1>
<p>Asplenium × irenemantoniae, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium scolopendrium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium × irenemantoniae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
