                <h1>Acrocephalus alboviridis</h1>
<p>Acrocephalus alboviridis, commonly known as the pale green reed warbler, is a small passerine bird native to various parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender body, long legs, and distinctive pale green plumage. The species typically inhabits wetlands, marshes, and reed beds, where it nests in dense vegetation. Its diet mainly consists of insects, especially during the breeding season.</p>
<p>This bird is known for its melodious song and is often heard but rarely seen in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus alboviridis has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and cylindrical, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences composed of small, greenish-white florets that bloom in early summer, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are small and dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus alboviridis is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of southern France.</p>
<p>It is also found in North Africa, particularly in regions like Morocco and Algeria. This plant thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often growing in dune environments. It is commonly associated with Mediterranean climates and is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Mediterranean basin and adjacent regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus alboviridis was mainly introduced to new habitats in Europe and parts of Asia through human activities such as horticulture and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments, including marshes and riverbanks, where it can establish itself quickly. The plant's adaptability to different soil types and its ability to spread via seeds have contributed to its successful introduction. It has become a common sight in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about potential competition with native species in some regions.</p>
