                <h1>Actephila merrilliana</h1>
<p>Actephila merrilliana, commonly known as the Merrill's actephila, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and are usually white or pale pink in color.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila merrilliana has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a glossy green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects.

<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila merrilliana is primarily native to China Southeast, Hainan.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of Hainan Island. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within the mountainous areas of the region. Actephila merrilliana is commonly associated with dense forests and is often found in the undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats in Hainan, reflecting its adaptation to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila merrilliana was mainly introduced to disturbed areas such as roadsides, waste grounds, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist to wet environments with partial to full shade. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. It has become a common sight in the understory of tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in many regions where it has been introduced.</p>
