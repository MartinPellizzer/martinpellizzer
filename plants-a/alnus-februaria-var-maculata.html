                    <h1>Alnus februaria var. maculata</h1>
<p>Alnus februaria var. maculata, commonly known as the speckled alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, oval leaves that often display a distinctive reddish or purplish discoloration, especially on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and along the edges of forests.</p>
<p>This species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, enriching the soil.</p>
