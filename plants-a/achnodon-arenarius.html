                <h1>Achnodon arenarius</h1>
<p>Achnodon arenarius, commonly known as the sand sparrowgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Achnodon arenarius is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and gravel plains.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnodon arenarius has small, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a fine, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense spikes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnodon arenarius is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, specifically South Africa and Namibia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils along the shorelines and dunes. This plant is commonly found in areas with high salt exposure and strong winds, such as the Atlantic and Indian Ocean coasts. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of well-drained, mineral-rich soils in these coastal habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnodon arenarius was mainly introduced to coastal and sandy habitats, particularly in regions with high salinity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dune ecosystems and along shorelines where it can thrive in harsh, wind-exposed conditions. The plant's ability to tolerate salt spray and poor soil nutrients makes it well-suited for these environments. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>However, its introduction can sometimes lead to competition with native plant species in invaded areas.</p>
