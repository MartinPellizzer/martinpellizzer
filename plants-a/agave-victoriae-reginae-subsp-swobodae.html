<p>Agave victoriae-reginae subsp.</p>
<p>swobodae, commonly known as the Queen Victoria agave, is a striking succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like growth habit and large, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces dramatic, yellowish-white inflorescences that can reach several meters in height, making it a striking ornamental plant. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and collections.</p>
