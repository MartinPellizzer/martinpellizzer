                <h1>Acalypha villosa var. latiuscula</h1>
<p>Acalypha villosa var. latiuscula, commonly known as the velvetleaf or woolly hollyhock, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a distinctive tactile quality. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape and often have a light green to bluish-green hue. It produces clusters of small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are usually clustered in terminal panicles.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha villosa var. latiuscula has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with fine, soft hairs, and has a pale green to brownish color, growing upright with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, clustered in dense, spicate inflorescences, with pale green to reddish bracts, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-winged schizocarp, dispersing by wind when dry, and the seeds are small and smooth.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha villosa var. latiuscula is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in the eastern and southern parts of the island, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. This variety typically grows in lowland forests and along stream banks, often at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters. Currently, it is distributed mainly in its native range, though its population is considered rare and it faces threats from habitat loss.</p>
<p>The conservation status of Acalypha villosa var. latiuscula is listed as endangered due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha villosa var. latiuscula is a vibrant, fast-growing shrub known for its striking foliage and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant thrives in a warm climate with a growth cycle that includes rapid vegetative growth followed by flowering in the summer months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring and pruning to maintain shape and encourage bushiness are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with neem oil or insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
