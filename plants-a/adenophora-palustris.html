                <h1>Adenophora palustris</h1>
<p>Adenophora palustris, commonly known as swamp bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often lance-shaped, adapted to thrive in moist or saturated soils. It is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Adenophora palustris plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora palustris has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is hairy and somewhat woody, with a grayish-green color, growing upright and branching sparingly. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and range in color from white to pale blue, blooming in late summer to early autumn and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in wet, boggy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora palustris is primarily native to Japan, Korea, and Manchuria.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and stream banks. It is often associated with temperate climates and thrives in areas with high humidity. The species is well adapted to the regional environmental conditions of these regions.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its historical distribution across East Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora palustris was mainly introduced to wetland and marsh habitats where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of wetland environments. This plant is known for its showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions, sometimes competing with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes near water features.</p>
