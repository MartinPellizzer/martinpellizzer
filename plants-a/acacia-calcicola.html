                    <h1>Acacia calcicola</h1>
<p>Acacia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and thrives in soils with high calcium content. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. Its leaves are reduced to phyllodes, which are flattened, leaf-like structures that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acacia calcicola plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
