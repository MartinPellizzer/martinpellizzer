                    <h1>Amblovenatum distinctum</h1>
<p>Amblovenatum distinctum, commonly known as the rare velvet fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its soft, velvety foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are densely packed, giving it a lush, carpet-like appearance. Its flowers are inconspicuous, typically green or brown, and are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Amblovenatum distinctum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
