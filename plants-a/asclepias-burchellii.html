<p>Asclepias burchellii, commonly known as the Burchell's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the milkweed family, Apocynaceae, and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
<p>Asclepias burchellii plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly as a host plant for certain butterfly species.</p>
