                    <h1>Appendicula reflexa f. cleistogama</h1>
<p>Appendicula reflexa f. cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous form of the reflexed appendicula, is a variant of the species characterized by its closed, self-fertilizing flowers.</p>
<p>This plant belongs to the family Primulaceae and is native to certain regions of Europe. The cleistogamous nature of its flowers means they remain closed throughout their development, facilitating self-pollination. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or rocky areas.</p>
<p>The foliage consists of hairy, ovate leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
