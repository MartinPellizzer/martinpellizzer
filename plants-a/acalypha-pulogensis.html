                        <h1>Acalypha pulogensis</h1>
<p>Acalypha pulogensis, commonly known as the golden bower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acalypha pulogensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage and unique inflorescences.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha pulogensis belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of a secondary cell wall and complex structures like stomata. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and flowering plants. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as roses and magnolias.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many species with diverse morphologies and ecological roles. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with milky sap and a wide range of growth forms. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "caper spurge," characterized by their showy inflorescences and often hairy leaves.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha pulogensis, a specific plant within the genus Acalypha, known for its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha pulogensis is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions of the archipelago, particularly in the tropical and subtropical areas. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. It is an important component of the local flora and has adapted to the humid climate of the region.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within the Philippines.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha pulogensis was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a potential weed in certain regions. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have contributed to its establishment in natural ecosystems. It is commonly found in coastal and urban environments where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
