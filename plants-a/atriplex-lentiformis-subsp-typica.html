<p>Atriplex lentiformis subsp.</p>
<p>typica, commonly known as the smooth saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in compact clusters, which are often subtended by bracts. It is well-suited to saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in extreme conditions makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects.</p>
