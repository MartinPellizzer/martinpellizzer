<p>Aspidium aculeatum subsp.</p>
<p>lonchitis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a perennial fern native to parts of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in wetlands, marshes, and slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it forms dense colonies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of fern reproductive structures.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more delicate appearance compared to other members of the species.</p>
