<p>Astragalus nivicola, commonly known as the snow vetcher, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Astragalus nivicola plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
