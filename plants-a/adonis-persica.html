                <h1>Adonis persica</h1>
<p>Adonis persica, commonly known as Persian glory-of-the-snow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, glaucous leaves and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or red. The flowers are typically borne on tall, slender stems and bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>It is also known for its toxic sap, which contains cardiac glycosides.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis persica has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring about 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are yellow and have a structure of five petals, blooming in early spring, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in rocky or arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis persica is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and the southern regions of Russia.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant is also present in some areas of northern Iran and western China. It is commonly found in open grasslands and along the edges of shrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis persica was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe as an ornamental plant due to its striking flowers.</p>
<p>It has since spread to other areas, including North America, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of environments. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread in non-native habitats.</p>
