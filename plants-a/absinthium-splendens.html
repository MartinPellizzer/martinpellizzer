<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Absinthium splendens has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a silvery-blue upper surface and a darker green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branched. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellowish-green petals and a strong, spicy aroma, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule containing tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and white, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Absinthium splendens is a striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in countries like Italy, France, and Spain.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to isolated populations in these areas, often in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Absinthium splendens is currently listed as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Absinthium splendens is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with division being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle of Absinthium splendens is perennial, with active growth in spring and summer, followed by a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be done in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
