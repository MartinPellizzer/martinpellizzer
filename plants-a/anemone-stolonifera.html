<p>Anemone stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread vegetatively through stolons, forming dense mats. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>Anemone stolonifera thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
