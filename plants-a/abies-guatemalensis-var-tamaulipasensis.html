                    <h1>Abies guatemalensis var. tamaulipasensis</h1>
<p>Abies guatemalensis var. tamaulipasensis, commonly known as the Tamaulipas fir, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Madre mountains in northeastern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
