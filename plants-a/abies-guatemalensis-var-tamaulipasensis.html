                        <h1>Abies guatemalensis var. tamaulipasensis</h1>
<p>Abies guatemalensis var. tamaulipasensis, commonly known as the Tamaulipas fir, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Madre mountains in northeastern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies guatemalensis var. tamaulipasensis is primarily native to southern Mexico, specifically the states of Veracruz, Tabasco, and Chiapas, as well as parts of northern Guatemala.</p>
<p>This variety thrives in humid, temperate climates with high rainfall and is commonly found in montane forests at elevations ranging from 600 to 2,000 meters. It is often associated with other coniferous species and grows in well-drained soils. The plant is an important component of the cloud forest ecosystems in these regions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and deforestation, its distribution has become increasingly fragmented.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies guatemalensis var. tamaulipasensis was mainly introduced to areas with a humid subtropical climate, characterized by high rainfall and mild temperatures.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in mountainous regions. This variant is particularly adapted to the ecological conditions of central and southern Mexico. Its introduction has been primarily for reforestation and ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited due to specific environmental requirements.</p>
