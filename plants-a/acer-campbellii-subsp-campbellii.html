                <h1>Acer campbellii subsp. campbellii</h1>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>campbellii, commonly known as the Campbell's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its distinctive red to orange-red foliage, which turns vibrant in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and dark reddish-brown, becoming more rugged with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>campbellii has palmately compound leaves that are typically three to five lobed, with a maple-like shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 10 inches in length. The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod that disperses by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the plant's natural habitat in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>campbellii is a rare and striking maple species native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, specifically in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. While it was once thought to be extinct, it has been rediscovered and is now known to occur in a few isolated locations within its native range.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, typically between 2,500 and 3,500 meters above sea level. It is found in cloud forests and among rocky outcrops, where it grows as an understory plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is currently listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>campbellii is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant foliage and compact growth. It can be propagated through semi-hardwood cuttings taken in late summer, which root readily under proper conditions. This species has a slow to moderate growth cycle, making it ideal for smaller gardens or containers.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions that can lead to root rot. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer supports healthy growth, while pruning in late winter helps maintain shape and remove diseased branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or flowering shrubs enhances its visual appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>campbellii is a unique maple species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife, including birds and small mammals, through its seeds and dense foliage. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring blossoms, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil quality by enhancing nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>campbellii is a rare and ornamental maple species primarily valued for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture and landscape design. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have limited traditional uses in certain indigenous cultures.</p>
<p>The tree's wood, though not widely used industrially, can be utilized for small-scale carpentry or decorative purposes. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in regions where it grows naturally, often representing resilience and beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems also contributes to biodiversity and habitat support in native environments.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>campbellii has several popular cultivars, including 'Gumpo' and 'Koontzii', which are prized for their vibrant fall colors and unique foliage patterns. It also has been used in hybridization to create other maple species, such as with Acer palmatum, resulting in cultivars that exhibit enhanced ornamental traits.</p>
<p>These hybrids often display improved cold hardiness and more striking leaf coloration. Horticulturally, Acer campbellii subsp. campbellii is important for its role in ornamental horticulture, particularly in shaded gardens and as a specimen tree.</p>
<p>Its genetic diversity contributes to the development of new cultivars with desirable characteristics for garden use.</p>
