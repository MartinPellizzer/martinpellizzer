<p>Atriplex paludosa var. cordivalvis, commonly known as the broadleaf saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant typically grows in saline soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptical in shape, with a distinctive waxy coating that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ability to thrive in high-salinity conditions, making it an important component of salt-tolerant vegetation.</p>
