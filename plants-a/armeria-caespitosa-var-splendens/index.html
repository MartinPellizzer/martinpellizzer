                            <h1>Armeria Caespitosa Var. Splendens</h1>
<p>Sea thrift, scientifically known as Armeria caespitosa var. splendens, is a hardy coastal plant that thrives in harsh maritime environments. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth and showy pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. Native to the rocky shores of the North Atlantic, it is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds. This plant is often used in coastal landscaping due to its resilience and ornamental value. Its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
