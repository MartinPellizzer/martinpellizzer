                    <h1>Arisaema triphyllum var. montanum</h1>
<p>Arisaema triphyllum var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain arrowhead, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, arrow-shaped leaf that is often split into three lobes, giving it its common name. The plant produces a unique, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a showy, hooded spathe. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the more widespread Arisaema triphyllum but is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and geographic distribution.</p>
