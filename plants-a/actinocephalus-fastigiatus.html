                <h1>Actinocephalus fastigiatus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus fastigiatus, commonly known as the slender rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus fastigiatus has simple, lanceolate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light brown color and a straight growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's arid environment.</p>
