                <h1>Acleisanthes obtusa</h1>
<p>Acleisanthes obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces edible seeds, though caution is advised as some parts may be toxic. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Acleisanthes obtusa is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes obtusa has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, and has a smooth, light gray bark that becomes rougher with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in shades of yellow to orange, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes obtusa is primarily native to Mexico Northeast, Mexico Southwest, and Texas.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It typically grows in rocky soils and is often seen in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The species is well adapted to the dry climate and can thrive with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific regions in North America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes obtusa was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along creek banks. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often spreading through its prolific seed production. It has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among land managers due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas.</p>
