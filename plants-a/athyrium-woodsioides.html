<p>Athyrium woodsioides, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense clumps, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a thin, protective indusium.</p>
