                    <h1>Atriplex pugae</h1>
<p>Atriplex pugae, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity.</p>
<p>Atriplex pugae plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
