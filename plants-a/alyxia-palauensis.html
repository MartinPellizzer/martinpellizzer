                    <h1>Alyxia palauensis</h1>
<p>Alyxia palauensis, commonly known as the Palau mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the islands of Palau in the western Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily ficus and mangrove species, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria. Alyxia palauensis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, contributing to nutrient cycling and providing food for local pollinators and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
