                <h1>Acomastylis glacialis</h1>
<p>Acomastylis glacialis, commonly known as the glacial acomastylis, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Acomastylis glacialis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acomastylis glacialis has small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed and arranged in a rosette pattern, providing insulation against harsh cold.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stubby, with a smooth, greenish-gray bark that lacks distinct ridges. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers with no petals, appearing in early summer and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>Its roots are shallow and fibrous, helping it anchor in rocky or soil-rich ground in polar environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomastylis glacialis is primarily native to the Antarctic region, specifically the Antarctic Peninsula and surrounding islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with extreme cold and high-altitude environments. This plant thrives in glacial and alpine habitats where temperatures remain consistently low. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Southern Hemisphere's polar regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomastylis glacialis was mainly introduced to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine and tundra habitats where the climate is cold and the soil is often frozen. This plant is typically associated with rocky or gravelly substrates and is adapted to low temperatures and short growing seasons. Its introduction to these regions is largely due to its ability to thrive in harsh, polar environments.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is limited by the availability of suitable habitats and the extreme conditions of these high-altitude areas.</p>
