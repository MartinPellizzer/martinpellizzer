<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs, which are thickened stems that store water and nutrients. The fronds are typically dark green, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
