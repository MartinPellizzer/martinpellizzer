                <h1>Acalypha paniculata</h1>
<p>Acalypha paniculata, commonly known as the flame bush, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, showy, red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it suitable for hedges and garden borders.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha paniculata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a glossy green color that may turn reddish in some varieties.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing in a upright and branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in paniculate inflorescences, with pale yellow to white petals, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed schizocarp that splits into three one-seeded parts, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
