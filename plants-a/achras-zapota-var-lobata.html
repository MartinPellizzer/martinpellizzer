                <h1>Achras zapota var. lobata</h1>
<p>Achras zapota var. lobata, commonly known as the mamey sapote, is a tropical tree native to Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, oblong leaves and produces a distinctive fruit with a sweet, creamy flesh. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, and it is often cultivated for its edible fruit and ornamental value.</p>
<p>The tree can reach heights of up to 15 meters and is valued for both its ecological and economic contributions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras zapota var. lobata has palmate leaves that are typically 30-50 cm in diameter, with 5-7 lobes, dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a vertical growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that splits open to release smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras zapota var. lobata is a tropical plant native to Central America, particularly found in countries like Mexico and Guatemala.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Caribbean and southern Florida, where it has been introduced. It thrives in humid, tropical environments, often growing in lowland areas near rivers or in coastal regions. This species typically grows at altitudes below 300 meters, preferring well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat loss, it is considered a species of concern, though its conservation status is not yet fully assessed.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras zapota var. lobata is a fast-growing, evergreen tree known for its large, edible fruits and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings showing the highest success rate. The tree has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within 3-5 years, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is relatively resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face attacks from scale insects or fungal infections, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with legumes or nitrogen-fixing plants can enhance soil fertility and promote overall plant health.</p>
