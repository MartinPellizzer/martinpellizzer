<p>Atriplex lehmanniana, commonly known as Lehmann's saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Atriplex lehmanniana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
