                <h1>Adipe vitellina</h1>
<p>Adipe vitellina, commonly known as the golden eggplant, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive, egg-shaped fruits.</p>
<p>The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and peppers, and is native to tropical regions of South America. Its fruits are typically yellow or orange in color, with a thick, waxy skin that protects the fleshy interior. The leaves are broad and lobed, often with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant can grow up to 2 meters in height.</p>
<p>Adipe vitellina is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its potential culinary uses in traditional dishes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adipe vitellina has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipe vitellina is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and abundant rainfall. This plant is commonly found in tropical rainforests and along riverbanks where it can access ample moisture. It plays a significant role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is also occasionally cultivated in other tropical regions for ornamental or medicinal purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipe vitellina was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in disturbed ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions make it an effective pioneer species.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive itself.</p>
