<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × tomentoides has compound, basal leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a grayish-white pubescent surface, and are arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to grayish color, with a branching growth pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × tomentoides is a hybrid plant that originated from the cross between Achillea millefolium and Achillea × rhombifolia.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of the Himalayas. Today, it is also found in regions of western and central Europe, often cultivated in gardens and landscapes. This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>It is currently considered of least concern in terms of conservation status due to its adaptability and widespread cultivation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
