                <h1>Acer italum f. hispanicum</h1>
<p>Acer italum f. hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 15 meters.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its autumn color.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer italum f. hispanicum has alternate, palmately compound leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin and a bright green upper surface that turns yellow or red in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in panicles, appearing in late spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to stabilize the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer italum f. hispanicum is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula, particularly Spain.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in southern Spain. It thrives in humid, temperate environments, typically found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. This subspecies grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer italum f. hispanicum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle of this tree is moderate, with new growth appearing in early spring and foliage turning brilliant red in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and annual pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or conifers can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer italum f. hispanicum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in mixed-species forests, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a diverse range of organisms in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer italum f. hispanicum is a lesser-known maple species that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in traditional herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in local ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and serving as a habitat for various wildlife species. While not widely used in industrial applications, its wood may be utilized in small-scale crafts or furniture-making. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its conservation is important for maintaining ecological balance and preserving genetic diversity in maple species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
