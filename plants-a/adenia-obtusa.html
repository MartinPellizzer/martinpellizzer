                <h1>Adenia obtusa</h1>
<p>Adenia obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved adenia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. These flowers are followed by orange or red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans.</p>
<p>Adenia obtusa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and rocky outcrops.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia obtusa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture that is typically reddish-brown in color, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small and greenish-white in color, with a simple structure consisting of five petals, and they bloom during the wet season, being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia obtusa is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions such as New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in subtropical and tropical rainforests, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is typically associated with coastal and inland rainforest habitats.</p>
<p>Adenia obtusa is also found in some parts of New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia obtusa was mainly introduced to areas with a humid tropical climate, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with rich, well-drained soils, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. The plant is known for its striking, large flowers and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
