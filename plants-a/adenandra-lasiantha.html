                <h1>Adenandra lasiantha</h1>
<p>Adenandra lasiantha, commonly known as the silver tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Adenandra lasiantha is often used in landscaping for its ornamental bark and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra lasiantha has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale grey bark that develops fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that splits open to release smooth, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra lasiantha is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>It is found in the fynbos biome, which is characteristic of the region. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along the coastal areas. It is commonly seen in open habitats such as cliffs and slopes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to the western and southern parts of the Cape Provinces.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra lasiantha was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the North Island, particularly in the Bay of Plenty and Hawke's Bay regions. The plant thrives in coastal and lowland environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to manage its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
