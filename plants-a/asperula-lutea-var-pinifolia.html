<p>Asperula lutea var. pinifolia, commonly known as the dwarf alpine azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
