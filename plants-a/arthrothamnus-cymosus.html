                    <h1>Arthrothamnus cymosus</h1>
<p>Arthrothamnus cymosus, commonly known as the clustered thorny shrub, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, often spiny growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact cymes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to survive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Arthrothamnus cymosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
