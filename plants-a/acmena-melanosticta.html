                <h1>Acmena melanosticta</h1>
<p>Acmena melanosticta, commonly known as the black-stained acmena, is a species of flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and are followed by small, woody fruits.</p>
<p>Acmena melanosticta is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena melanosticta has simple, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a light grey bark that peels off in thin flakes as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, featuring white petals with a yellow center, and they bloom in spring, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena melanosticta is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rainforest, wet sclerophyll forest, and coastal areas. The plant thrives in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in shaded understorey environments.</p>
<p>Acmena melanosticta is an evergreen shrub or small tree that plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena melanosticta was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was initially brought there for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats, including forests and wetlands. The plant competes with native species and can alter ecosystem dynamics.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
