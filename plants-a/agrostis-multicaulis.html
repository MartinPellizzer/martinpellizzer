<p>Agrostis multicaulis, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense, low tufts and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Agrostis multicaulis is valued for its fine texture and is used in turfgrass management and ecological restoration projects.</p>
