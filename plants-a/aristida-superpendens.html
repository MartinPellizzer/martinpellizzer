<p>Aristida superpendens, commonly known as the hanging grass or silky hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that bear dense clusters of tiny, silky florets, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a light green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Aristida superpendens is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
