                    <h1>Asplenium fragile var. stoloniferum</h1>
<p>Asplenium fragile var. stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, typical of ferns, and often forms dense mats on rocks or soil. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread horizontally, creating extensive colonies.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings.</p>
