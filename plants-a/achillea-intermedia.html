                <h1>Achillea intermedia</h1>
<p>Achillea intermedia, commonly known as common yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat-topped clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter.</p>
<p>Achillea intermedia is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea intermedia has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, serrated, and typically 5â€“15 cm long, with a grayish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are yellowish-green composite blooms, consisting of many tiny florets arranged in a flat-topped cluster, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea intermedia is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in countries such as Spain, Portugal, and southern France.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to parts of North Africa and the Mediterranean region. This species thrives in dry, rocky, or gravelly environments, often growing in open habitats like slopes and grasslands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Achillea intermedia is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not currently threatened with extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea intermedia is a hardy perennial plant known for its fluffy yellow flowers and aromatic foliage, commonly grown in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing established clumps, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, producing flowers in its second year before dying back, though it often self-seeds and reappears in subsequent seasons.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with drought tolerance once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its compact form. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea intermedia is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering food and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting biodiversity.</p>
