                <h1>Achnatherum pelliotii</h1>
<p>Achnatherum pelliotii, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Achnatherum pelliotii plays a significant ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum pelliotii has leaves that are narrow, grass-like, with a linear shape, alternate arrangement, and a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and has a smooth texture, growing in dense tufts or clumps. The flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-like structures, typically green to pale brown in color, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant establish and spread in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum pelliotii is primarily native to China North-Central, Inner Mongolia, Mongolia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang.</p>
<p>This grass species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in open habitats such as steppes, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum pelliotii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along trails.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates and moderate precipitation. This species is often associated with disturbed environments due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its introduction has been documented in several parts of North America, particularly in the western United States.</p>
<p>It is considered a weed in some agricultural and ecological contexts due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
