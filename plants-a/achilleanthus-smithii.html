                <h1>Achilleanthus smithii</h1>
<p>Achilleanthus smithii, commonly known as the Smith's achilleanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achilleanthus smithii has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unbranched. Its flowers are clustered in panicles, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achilleanthus smithii is primarily native to Fiji.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical regions of the island nation, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. It thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to Fiji, where it plays a role in the local flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achilleanthus smithii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness. Despite its beauty, it has since become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in coastal environments and can spread rapidly along shorelines.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
