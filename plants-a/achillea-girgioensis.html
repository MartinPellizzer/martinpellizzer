                <h1>Achillea girgioensis</h1>
<p>Achillea girgioensis, commonly known as the Gjergjë yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Balkan region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a soft, silvery down, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Achillea girgioensis is often found in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils, where it thrives in well-drained conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea girgioensis has leaves that are basal, forming a rosette, with a lanceolate shape, a gray-green color, and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing in a丛生 pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of white ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and pappus structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea girgioensis is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, specifically found in parts of southern Italy and northern Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in the Apennines and surrounding areas. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is commonly found in alpine and subalpine environments. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat degradation, Achillea girgioensis is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea girgioensis is a hardy perennial plant known for its showy, daisy-like flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer, ensuring good germination rates under full sun. This plant has a growth cycle that begins with spring growth, flowering in mid to late summer, and entering a dormant state in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flowers to encourage continuous blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or chives can help deter pests and enhance garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea girgioensis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering shelter and a habitat within its dense foliage. This plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of neighboring species by enhancing soil health and promoting biodiversity. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea girgioensis also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea girgioensis is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses compared to other members of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>While it may not have widespread culinary applications, it is occasionally used in local traditional recipes in its native regions. In medicinal contexts, it is believed to possess mild anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Its role in industrial and economic contexts is minimal, as it is not widely cultivated or utilized for commercial purposes.</p>
