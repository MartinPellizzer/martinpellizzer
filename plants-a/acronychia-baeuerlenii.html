                <h1>Acronychia baeuerlenii</h1>
<p>Acronychia baeuerlenii, commonly known as the Baeuerlen's acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and simple, alternate leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow in color, and it produces woody capsules as fruit.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia baeuerlenii has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically gray to brown in color. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have yellowish-green petals, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia baeuerlenii is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of eastern Australia. This species typically grows in rainforest or coastal areas with high humidity. It is often associated with rocky or sandy soils in these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these states.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia baeuerlenii was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of eastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal heathlands and dune systems. This plant is well adapted to salt-laden winds and can tolerate moderate drought conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a rare and threatened species due to habitat loss and land development.</p>
