<p>Acacia adstringens, commonly known as the African bristled acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorned stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets. The plant produces yellow, globular inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its bark and leaves contain tannins, which have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their astringent properties.</p>
<p>Acacia adstringens thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often forming part of the vegetation in savanna ecosystems.</p>
