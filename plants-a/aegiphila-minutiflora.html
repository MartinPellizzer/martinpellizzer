<p>Aegiphila minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are often aromatic and have a mint-like scent, which is a common trait in the Lamiaceae family.</p>
<p>Aegiphila minutiflora is often found in rocky or dry habitats, thriving in the high-altitude environments of the Andes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila minutiflora has small, narrow leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with a pale green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are tiny, clustered in umbels, and range in color from white to pale pink, blooming during the dry season and being pollinated by insects.
