                <h1>Acalypha ecuadorica</h1>
<p>Acalypha ecuadorica, commonly known as the Ecuadorian spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often strikingly colorful species. The plant is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests.</p>
<p>Acalypha ecuadorica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha ecuadorica has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a bright green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes more fibrous with age. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typically yellowish-green in color, and bloom during the wet season, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a three-winged schizocarp, dispersing by wind once it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha ecuadorica is a species native to the western regions of South America, primarily found in Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Colombia, Venezuela, and the Galápagos Islands, though it remains most abundant in its native range. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests and understorey habitats. This plant typically grows at altitudes between 300 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for further protection efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha ecuadorica is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth patterns.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with stem cuttings offering the quickest and most reliable results. This plant thrives in a warm, humid climate with a growth cycle that includes a dormant period during colder months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, requiring watering when the top layer of soil begins to dry. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are essential, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden’s aesthetic.</p>
