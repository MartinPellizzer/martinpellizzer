                <h1>Adicea rufa</h1>
<p>Adicea rufa, commonly known as the redstem ironweed, is a perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features upright stems that are reddish-brown in color, which give it its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adicea rufa produces small, purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea rufa has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length and 1 to 2 centimeters in width.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a deep green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea rufa is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the shores of islands such as Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and salt marshes. It is also present in some parts of southern Florida, USA.</p>
<p>Adicea rufa is an important component of the coastal vegetation in these tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea rufa was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It has since spread to several regions, particularly in the southern and western states, where it thrives in disturbed soils and sunny environments. Despite its aesthetic appeal, the plant has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it a challenge for land managers and conservationists.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread include mechanical removal, herbicides, and biological control methods.</p>
