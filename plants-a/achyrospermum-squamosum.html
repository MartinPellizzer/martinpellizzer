                <h1>Achyrospermum squamosum</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum squamosum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, velvety leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its flowers, which are usually blue or purple, bloom in the morning and close by midday.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum squamosum has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a greyish-brown bark that is smooth when young but becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring tubular corollas with five lobes, and are typically pink to red in color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum squamosum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savanna and grassland habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is also present in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in open woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with a warm climate and moderate rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum squamosum was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activities, such as accidental transport in soil or on vehicles. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it poses a threat to local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
