                <h1>Acrostichum quercifolium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum quercifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that resemble the shape of oak leaves, giving it its scientific name. The plant has a tall, unbranched stem with a crown of feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically green on the upper surface and pale underneath, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum quercifolium has large, broad, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 15â€“30 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is brown to reddish in color, and the plant grows as a shrub or small tree. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a red, fleshy drupe that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum quercifolium is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and swampy areas where it thrives in humid, warm climates. This plant is often associated with wetlands and coastal areas, where it forms dense stands. It is also occasionally found in parts of eastern Australia and New Guinea.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat is characterized by high rainfall and rich, moist soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum quercifolium was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near water bodies or in forested regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates with well-drained to slightly acidic soils. This plant is commonly found in regions of the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. It has been introduced to other parts of the world where similar climatic conditions exist.</p>
<p>Its introduction has sometimes led to its establishment in natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential impact on native flora.</p>
