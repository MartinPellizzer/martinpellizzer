<p>Alchemilla acutiloba var. indivisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long-lasting flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
