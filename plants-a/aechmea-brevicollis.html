                <h1>Aechmea brevicollis</h1>
<p>Aechmea brevicollis, commonly known as the short-necked pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Aechmea brevicollis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea brevicollis has rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a compact circle, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, instead having a short, fibrous base that resembles a pseudostem, and its bark is smooth and pale green. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the rainy season, and they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animal activity.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the surrounding environment.</p>
