                    <h1>Aristolochia longa var. multinervis</h1>
<p>Aristolochia longa var. multinervis, commonly known as the slender Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins, which give it the varietal name "multinervis.". The plant produces unique, tubular flowers that are often greenish or reddish in color, with a strong, often unpleasant odor. These flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects, particularly flies.</p>
<p>The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been used in traditional medicine, though they are now largely avoided due to their nephrotoxic effects.</p>
