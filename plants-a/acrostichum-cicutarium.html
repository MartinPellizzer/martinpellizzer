                    <h1>Acrostichum cicutarium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum cicutarium, commonly known as the common brake fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that are often used as a source of natural fiber. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are often harvested for their fibrous petioles, which have been historically used in basket-making and paper production.</p>
