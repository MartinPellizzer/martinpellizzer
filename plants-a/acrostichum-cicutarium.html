                <h1>Acrostichum cicutarium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum cicutarium, commonly known as the common brake fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that are often used as a source of natural fiber. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are often harvested for their fibrous petioles, which have been historically used in basket-making and paper production.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cicutarium has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 10â€“20 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody, with a smooth texture and a light brown color, growing in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are greenish-white in color, blooming from spring to summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-winged samara that disperses via wind, and the seeds are minute and numerous.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cicutarium is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams and rivers. This plant thrives in humid environments with rich, moist soil. It is also known to occur in the Caribbean and some areas of southern Florida.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to its preference for aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cicutarium was mainly introduced to wetlands and disturbed areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in swampy regions, along riverbanks, and in areas with frequent flooding. This plant can spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its introduction has led to competition with native vegetation, altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to control its spread and protect biodiversity.</p>
