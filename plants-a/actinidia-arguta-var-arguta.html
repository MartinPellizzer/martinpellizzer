<p>Actinidia arguta var. arguta, commonly known as the hardy kiwi, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, inedible berries that turn from green to brown as they mature. The plant thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil with partial to full sun exposure. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or espalier training.</p>
<p>The fruit, while not typically eaten raw, can be used in jams and desserts after cooking.</p>
