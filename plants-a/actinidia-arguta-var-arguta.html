                <h1>Actinidia arguta var. arguta</h1>
<p>Actinidia arguta var. arguta, commonly known as hardy kiwi, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, inedible berries that turn from green to brown as they mature. The plant thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its fruit, though not typically eaten raw, can be processed into jams or wines.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>

<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern using tendrils. The flowers are small, greenish-white, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a yellowish berry, about 1-2 cm in diameter, containing small seeds that are dispersed by birds and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself while climbing.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia arguta var. arguta is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, specifically China, where it grows in temperate forests and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Russia, Korea, and Japan, although it is primarily found in its native range. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, commonly found in woodland understories. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>The species is listed as least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not currently at risk of extinction.</p>
