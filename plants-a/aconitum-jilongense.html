                <h1>Aconitum jilongense</h1>
<p>Aconitum jilongense, commonly known as the Jilong monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in areas where children or pets are present.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum jilongense has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, exhibiting a straight growth pattern. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with a spurred petal and a five-lobed corolla, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, tuberous, and fibrous, serving as storage organs and anchoring the plant in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum jilongense is primarily native to Tibet.</p>
<p>It is found in the high-altitude regions of this region, typically in alpine meadows and rocky areas. The plant is adapted to the cold and harsh climate of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific habitats within Tibet, reflecting its ecological specificity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum jilongense was mainly introduced to China, where it has been documented in several provinces including Yunnan, Sichuan, and Tibet.</p>
<p>It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. This plant is characterized by its tall spires of blue to purple flowers and its preference for cool, temperate climates. Although it is not widely cultivated, it has become a subject of interest for botanists due to its unique ecological niche.</p>
<p>Its introduction to these regions has contributed to the biodiversity of high-altitude flora in southern China.</p>
