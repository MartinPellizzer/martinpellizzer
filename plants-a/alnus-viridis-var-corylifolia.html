<p>Alnus viridis var. corylifolia, commonly known as the winged hazelnut, is a variant of the green alder that exhibits distinctive botanical features.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with small, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, typical of the Betulaceae family. Its fruit is a nut enclosed in a cupule, which splits to release the seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.</p>
