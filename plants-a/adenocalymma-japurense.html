                <h1>Adenocalymma japurense</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma japurense, commonly known as the Brazilian star apple, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its branched, thorny stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits resembling small apples. The fruit has a sweet, aromatic pulp with a mild flavor, often consumed fresh or used in jams and beverages.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruit and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma japurense has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exhibits a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months, and is primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, acidic soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma japurense is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, specifically Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the states of Pará, Amazonas, and Amapá, which are part of the Amazon Basin. This plant thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the northern part of Brazil within the Amazon rainforest.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma japurense was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its unique and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in botanical gardens and private collections where it is cultivated for its aesthetic value. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered invasive in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
