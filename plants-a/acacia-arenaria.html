                    <h1>Acacia arenaria</h1>
<p>Acacia arenaria, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, flat, feathery leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to the landscape. Its seeds are encased in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Acacia arenaria is well-suited for desert landscaping due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature.</p>
