<p>Astrophytum asterioides, commonly known as the star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, spiny stems that form a globular shape, often resembling a star when viewed from above. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Astrophytum asterioides is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and striking appearance.</p>
