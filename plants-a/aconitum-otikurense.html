                <h1>Aconitum otikurense</h1>
<p>Aconitum otikurense, commonly known as the Otikuren Aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shady environments at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters. The plant features a robust root system and produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Like other aconites, it contains toxic alkaloids and requires careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum otikurense has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is hairy, with a rough texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurs, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum otikurense is primarily native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Himalayas, specifically in Nepal and northern India.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters. This species is commonly found in areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum otikurense was mainly introduced to specific regions in Europe for its ornamental value due to its striking blue-violet flowers.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century in botanical gardens and private collections. The plant is often cultivated in moist, shaded areas and has become a popular choice for gardeners seeking unique foliage and floral displays. However, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, careful management is required to prevent its spread beyond controlled environments.</p>
