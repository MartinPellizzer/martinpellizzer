<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white to pink flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Adelia javanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia javanica has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slight ridged texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia javanica is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines, although its range has become fragmented due to habitat loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as primary and secondary forests, often growing near the forest floor. Adelia javanica is typically found at altitudes between 0 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited natural populations, it is currently listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
