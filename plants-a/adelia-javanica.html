                <h1>Adelia javanica</h1>
<p>Adelia javanica, commonly known as the Java Adelia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive elliptical shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Adelia javanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia javanica has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia javanica is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in lowland forests and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often growing in shaded understory environments. Its natural range extends to parts of Oceania, including New Guinea and nearby islands.</p>
<p>Adelia javanica is an important component of the local flora in these regions, contributing to biodiversity and ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia javanica was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and warm temperatures, making it suitable for cultivation in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and ability to adapt to various soil conditions. Its introduction has been associated with both ecological and agricultural benefits in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential invasiveness in new environments.</p>
