                <h1>Achnatherum parishii</h1>
<p>Achnatherum parishii, commonly known as the Sierra grass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spikelet-based flowers in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>Achnatherum parishii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum parishii has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and typically range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and smooth with a light green to grayish hue, growing in a clumping pattern. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, dry, dehiscent lemma that disperses seeds by wind, with each seed being minute and having a hairy coating for aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum parishii is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in the Great Basin and the Intermountain West.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe, grasslands, and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in arid to semi-arid environments and is often associated with disturbed or marginal soils. It is a perennial grass that plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes states such as Nevada, Utah, Idaho, and Oregon.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum parishii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states like California, Nevada, and Utah.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed areas, and along roadsides. This plant is often associated with disturbed soils and can thrive in areas with limited moisture. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various ecological communities, sometimes competing with native vegetation.</p>
<p>It is considered a non-native species in these regions, though it has become naturalized in some areas.</p>
