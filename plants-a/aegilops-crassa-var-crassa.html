                    <h1>Aegilops crassa var. crassa</h1>
<p>Aegilops crassa var. crassa, commonly known as the broad-leafed wild wheat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing two to three small, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it has been studied for its potential role in crop improvement and genetic diversity research.</p>
