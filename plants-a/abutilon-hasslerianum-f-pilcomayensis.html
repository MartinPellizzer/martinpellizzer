                <h1>Abutilon hasslerianum f. pilcomayensis</h1>
<p>Abutilon hasslerianum f. pilcomayensis, commonly known as the Peruvian flame tree, is a variant of the common velvetleaf.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and striking floral display make it a popular choice for tropical and subtropical landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon hasslerianum f. pilcomayensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture, and it exhibits a woody growth pattern, often branching profusely. The flowers are pendulous, with a distinctive bell-shaped structure, and are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon hasslerianum f. pilcomayensis is a rare plant native to the high Andean regions of Bolivia and Peru.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the Cordillera Real and other mountain ranges in the south-central Andes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soils, typically found in cloud forests. This species grows at altitudes between 2,500 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is classified as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon hasslerianum f. pilcomayensis is a striking, fast-growing shrub known for its velvety, maple-like leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seed, with cuttings offering the quickest and most reliable results. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid conditions and often reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining, fertile soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abutilon hasslerianum f. pilcomayensis is a flowering plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native flora in the surrounding area. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining biodiversity by offering ecological benefits to both plant and animal life.</p>
