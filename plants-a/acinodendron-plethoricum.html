                <h1>Acinodendron plethoricum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron plethoricum, commonly known as the swollen acacia, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, swollen, thorned stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of leaflets, and it is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological importance, it is not widely cultivated and remains a lesser-known species within the Fabaceae family.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron plethoricum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is brown to grey in color, and it grows as a shrub with a dense, upright habit. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and helping it to absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron plethoricum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Zambia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist lowland forests and along riverbanks where the climate is warm and humid. This species thrives in areas with rich organic soil and consistent rainfall, making it a characteristic component of the understory vegetation. It is also occasionally reported in parts of Southeast Asia, though its presence there is less documented.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its primary range in Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron plethoricum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and degraded habitats, often as part of ecological restoration efforts.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade conditions. The plant's rapid growth and ability to establish itself in poor soil make it a useful species for stabilizing erosion-prone areas. However, its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native plant species, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent it from becoming invasive in certain environments.</p>
