<p>Acinodendron plethoricum, commonly known as the swollen acacia, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, swollen, thorned stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of leaflets, and it is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological importance, it is not widely cultivated and remains a lesser-known species within the Fabaceae family.</p>
