<p>Aegilops pubiglumis, commonly known as the pubescent wheatgrass, is a wild relative of wheat native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant produces awned florets, which are typical of the tribe Aveneae. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Aegilops pubiglumis is of interest to researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement programs.</p>
