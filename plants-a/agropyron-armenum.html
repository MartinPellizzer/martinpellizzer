<p>Agropyron armenum, commonly known as Armenian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Agropyron armenum is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species often found in alpine and steppe habitats.</p>
