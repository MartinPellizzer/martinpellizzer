                    <h1>Androsace villosa f. globiferoides</h1>
<p>Androsace villosa f. globiferoides, commonly known as the woolly androsace, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with hairy, silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are arranged in umbel-like inflorescences. Its succulent stems and leaves are adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>This cultivar is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
