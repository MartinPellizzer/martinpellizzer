                <h1>Actinocephalus divaricatus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus divaricatus, commonly known as the variable corymbia, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dense, often woody growth habit. The plant features small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in corymb-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>Actinocephalus divaricatus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus divaricatus has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually green and slightly hairy, with a smooth margin.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is gray to brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus divaricatus is primarily native to South Africa, specifically the eastern and western Cape provinces.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and coastal areas along the southern coast of the country. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with fynbos vegetation. It is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by wet winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus divaricatus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments where it can thrive in partial shade to full sun. This plant has shown adaptability to different soil types, which contributes to its spread in non-native regions. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, more research is needed to fully understand its ecological effects.</p>
