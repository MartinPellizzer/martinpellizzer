                    <h1>Asplenium sherburgense</h1>
<p>Asplenium sherburgense, commonly known as the Sherburg's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and densely arranged. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Asplenium sherburgense is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates, making it an adaptable and resilient plant in its native habitats.</p>
