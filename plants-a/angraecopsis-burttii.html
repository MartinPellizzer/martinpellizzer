                <h1>Angraecopsis burttii</h1>
<p>Angraecopsis burttii, commonly known as the Burtt's star orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its star-shaped flowers, which are predominantly white with deep purple or violet markings. The plant produces its flowers on tall, slender stems, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a period of dormancy during the dry season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
