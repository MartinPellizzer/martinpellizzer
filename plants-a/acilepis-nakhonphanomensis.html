                <h1>Acilepis nakhonphanomensis</h1>
<p>Acilepis nakhonphanomensis, commonly known as the Nakhonphanom acacia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes and is characterized by its pod fruits. The plant is notable for its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare species with potential ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis nakhonphanomensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis nakhonphanomensis is primarily native to Thailand.</p>
<p>This rare plant is found in specific regions within the country, particularly in the southern and northeastern areas. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often in forested or semi-shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered an endemic species of Thailand.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are important to protect its natural habitat from environmental degradation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis nakhonphanomensis was mainly introduced to Thailand, where it has been recorded in the northern and central regions.</p>
<p>It is typically found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, open forests, and along riverbanks. The plant has adapted well to the local climate and soil conditions, allowing it to spread across different elevations. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to monitor its spread and manage its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
