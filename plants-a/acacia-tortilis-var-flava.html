                        <h1>Acacia tortilis var. flava</h1>
<p>Acacia tortilis var. flava, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twisted branches and yellowish-green phyllodes, which are modified leaves adapted for reducing water loss. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that bloom during the rainy season, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its roots form associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>The wood and foliage have been traditionally used for fuel, construction, and medicinal purposes by local communities.</p>
