                <h1>Aciphylla dissecta</h1>
<p>Aciphylla dissecta, commonly known as the dissected spinifex, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage that forms a low-growing mat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in coastal and inland sand dunes, where it is adapted to harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Aciphylla dissecta plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla dissecta has leaves that are finely dissected, appearing feather-like, with a grayish-blue color and a waxy texture, arranged in a basal rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is short and often hidden beneath the leaves, with a rough, fibrous bark that is typically greenish-brown in color. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, clustered in a dense inflorescence, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the dry, rocky habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla dissecta is primarily native to New Zealand North.</p>
<p>It is found in the northern parts of the North Island, including the Bay of Plenty and the Coromandel Peninsula. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and on rocky outcrops. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in open habitats.</p>
<p>Aciphylla dissecta is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla dissecta was mainly introduced to the data as a rare and endemic species found in specific alpine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette growth form and silvery foliage, adapted to harsh climatic conditions. The distribution data highlights its presence in limited geographic regions, primarily in New Zealand. This plant is of particular interest due to its ecological significance and conservation status.</p>
<p>The introduction of its distribution data aids in understanding its habitat requirements and threats.</p>
