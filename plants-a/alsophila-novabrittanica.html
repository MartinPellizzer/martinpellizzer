                    <h1>Alsophila novabrittanica</h1>
<p>Alsophila novabrittanica, commonly known as the New Britain cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the island of New Britain in the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal or lowland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
