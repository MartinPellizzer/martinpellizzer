                    <h1>Acacia praemorsa</h1>
<p>Acacia praemorsa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Acacia praemorsa is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep root systems and waxy leaf surfaces to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
