<p>Achillea hybrida, commonly known as yarrow, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pink or red, surrounded by a layer of finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–90 cm, with a clump-forming habit and a long flowering period from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are aromatic and often have a slightly bitter taste, while its flowers are popular in gardens for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Achillea hybrida is native to Europe and western Asia but has been widely cultivated in temperate regions around the world.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>

<p>The stem is upright, hollow, and has a smooth, grayish-green bark, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pink ray florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea hybrida is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, particularly found in regions such as the British Isles, France, and southern Scandinavia.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been widely introduced and cultivated around the world, leading to a current distribution that includes parts of North America and Asia. This plant thrives in a variety of environments, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often in full sun. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 1,500 meters.</p>
