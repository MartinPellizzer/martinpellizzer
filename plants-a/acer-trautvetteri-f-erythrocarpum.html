                <h1>Acer trautvetteri f. erythrocarpum</h1>
<p>Acer trautvetteri f. erythrocarpum, commonly known as the red-fruited maple, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the maple tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red, fleshy fruits that persist through the winter, adding visual interest to the landscape. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China, and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticultural enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer trautvetteri f. erythrocarpum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops fissures with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in cymes, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer trautvetteri f. erythrocarpum is a rare plant species native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, particularly in Sichuan Province.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within its native range, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. It typically grows in shaded forest understories at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation and climate change, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer trautvetteri f. erythrocarpum is a unique maple species known for its vibrant red fruits and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be minimal to avoid overstimulation, while pruning is recommended in early spring to shape the tree and promote healthy growth. It is relatively pest and disease resistant, though it may occasionally attract aphids or develop fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer trautvetteri f. erythrocarpum is a unique maple species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer trautvetteri f. erythrocarpum is a rare maple species known for its ornamental value in horticulture and landscaping due to its striking red fruits and unique foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas in some regions. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, though its use remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and ecosystem stability, supporting local wildlife and soil health.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and natural beauty, often inspiring art and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer trautvetteri f. erythrocarpum has a limited number of naturally occurring varieties, but it is widely cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Atropurpureum' and 'Sutherlandii', which are known for their striking red foliage and unique leaf shapes. The species has been used in horticultural breeding to develop hybrids that combine the vibrant autumn colors of Acer trautvetteri with the hardiness of other maple species. These hybrids are particularly valued in gardens for their visual appeal and adaptability to different climates.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer trautvetteri f. erythrocarpum plays a significant role in the horticultural landscape due to its aesthetic qualities and genetic contributions to cultivated maples.</p>
