                <h1>Aeglopsis mangenotii</h1>
<p>Aeglopsis mangenotii, commonly known as the African ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in dense tropical forests. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeglopsis mangenotii has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green color; the leaves are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
