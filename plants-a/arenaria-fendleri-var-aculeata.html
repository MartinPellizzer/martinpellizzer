<p>Arenaria fendleri var. aculeata, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and minimal maintenance requirements.</p>
