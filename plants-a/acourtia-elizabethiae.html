                <h1>Acourtia elizabethiae</h1>
<p>Acourtia elizabethiae, commonly known as Elizabeth's acourtia, is a rare flowering plant native to the United States, specifically found in California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in coastal scrub habitats. It is notable for its limited distribution and is considered endangered due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
<p>Acourtia elizabethiae plays an important ecological role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia elizabethiae has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright, often branching slightly. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, winged seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia elizabethiae is primarily native to Mexico Northeast.</p>
<p>This rare plant is found in specific regions of northeastern Mexico, particularly in the states of Nuevo Le√≥n and Tamaulipas. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on limestone outcrops. The plant is adapted to the dry and semi-arid climate of the region.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a sensitive species requiring conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia elizabethiae was mainly introduced to coastal areas of southern California, where it thrives in sandy soils and dune environments.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activity, such as landscaping or accidental transport via vehicles or equipment. The plant is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It is often found in disturbed habitats, including roadsides and along beachfront properties.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect native plant communities.</p>
