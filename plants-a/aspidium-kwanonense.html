<p>Aspidium kwanonense, commonly known as the Kwanonense water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Aspidium kwanonense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and aiding in water filtration.</p>
