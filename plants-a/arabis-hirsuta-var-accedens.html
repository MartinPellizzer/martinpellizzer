                    <h1>Arabis hirsuta var. accedens</h1>
<p>Arabis hirsuta var. accedens, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are hairy and lance-shaped, with a rosette growth habit that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
