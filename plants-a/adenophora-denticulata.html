                <h1>Adenophora denticulata</h1>
<p>Adenophora denticulata, commonly known as the toothed bellflower, is a flowering plant native to parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its leaves are opposite and have a serrated or toothed margin, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Adenophora denticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora denticulata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a light green to brownish color, growing upright and branching sparingly. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, with white to pale blue petals, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora denticulata is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across these regions, particularly in mountainous areas. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Adenophora denticulata is listed as a species of concern due to habitat loss and overharvesting, leading to its conservation status being classified as vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenophora denticulata is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, bell-shaped flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for optimal germination. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, producing foliage in the first year and flowering in the second before dying back.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent moisture, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune spent flower stalks to encourage healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
