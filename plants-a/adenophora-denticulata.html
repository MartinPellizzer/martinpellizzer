                <h1>Adenophora denticulata</h1>
<p>Adenophora denticulata, commonly known as the toothed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped with finely toothed margins, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Adenophora denticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora denticulata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, covered with a rough, hairy texture, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are bell-shaped, with five lobes, typically pale blue to lavender in color, blooming from July to September, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black, oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in moist, woodland environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora denticulata is primarily native to eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in forested areas, meadows, and rocky slopes. This plant prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with mountainous regions. It is known for its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Adenophora denticulata is an important species in its native habitat, contributing to local biodiversity and ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora denticulata was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often in regions with moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade. The plant is known for its showy blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to several countries beyond its native range in East Asia.</p>
<p>However, its spread is often limited by its specific environmental requirements and regional climate conditions.</p>
