                <h1>Acorus tatarinowii</h1>
<p>Acorus tatarinowii, commonly known as Japanese sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that grow from a central rosette. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>Acorus tatarinowii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus tatarinowii has broad, sword-shaped leaves that are usually bright green, arranged in a fan-like pattern, and can grow up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stout, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright from the base. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in a spadix surrounded by a leaf-like spathe, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed, berry-like structure that disperses its seeds by water and animals.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous roots are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in wet, marshy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus tatarinowii is primarily native to eastern Asia, including regions such as China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and the margins of ponds and lakes. This plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments and is often associated with slow-moving or still water bodies. It is particularly common in the temperate regions of China, especially in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Sichuan.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can also be found in parts of Russia and the Korean Peninsula.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus tatarinowii was mainly introduced to wetland areas and water gardens due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with stagnant or slow-moving water, such as ponds, marshes, and along the edges of lakes. This plant has been widely cultivated in horticulture for its attractive, arrow-shaped leaves and its ability to help filter water. However, in some regions, it has become invasive, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on biodiversity in non-native habitats.</p>
