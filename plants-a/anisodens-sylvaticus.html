<p>Anisodens sylvaticus, commonly known as the European mountain ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Anisodens sylvaticus is often found in woodland edges, rocky soils, and mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as both a habitat provider and a contributor to local biodiversity.</p>
