                <h1>Aconitum tatrae</h1>
<p>Aconitum tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum tatrae is also noted for its toxic alkaloids, which make it both dangerous and a subject of botanical and pharmacological interest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum tatrae has large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are blue to purple in color, forming dense spikes at the top of the plant, and bloom from July to August, being pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are long and fibrous, anchoring the plant in rocky or moist soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tatrae is primarily native to the Tatra Mountains, which span across the border of Slovakia and Poland.</p>
<p>This plant is found in alpine and subalpine regions, typically in rocky or grassy areas at high elevations. It thrives in the cold, moist environments typical of mountainous terrain. Aconitum tatrae is a member of the buttercup family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within the Tatra region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tatrae was mainly introduced to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly in the Tatra Mountains.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. This plant is known for its striking blue or purple flowers and is a member of the buttercup family. It has been observed in several countries including Poland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
