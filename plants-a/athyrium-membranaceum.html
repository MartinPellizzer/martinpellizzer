                    <h1>Athyrium membranaceum</h1>
<p>Athyrium membranaceum, commonly known as the delicate fern or paper fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that are typically light green and have a delicate, almost translucent appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
