                <h1>Acrostichum subcordatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum subcordatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forests and swamps. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually divided into lobes, giving the plant a distinctive, feathery appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum subcordatum has leaves that are elongated, lance-shaped, and have a subcordate base, arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a glossy dark green color and can reach up to 1 meter in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows horizontally along the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, blooming during the summer months, and is pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum subcordatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along riverbanks where there is abundant moisture. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. Its distribution extends from Mexico through the Caribbean islands to parts of northern South America.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in Florida and the southern United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum subcordatum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and wetlands in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in marshes, tidal flats, and other brackish water environments. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and can thrive in areas with high salinity. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered landscapes.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
