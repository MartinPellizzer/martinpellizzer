<p>Aztekium ritteri var. rotundum, commonly known as the round-leafed aztekium, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, globular shape and distinctive, rounded, greenish-gray stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
