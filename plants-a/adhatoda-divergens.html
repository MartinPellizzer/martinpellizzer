                <h1>Adhatoda divergens</h1>
<p>Adhatoda divergens, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green or white, with five petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The leaves and roots of Adhatoda divergens have been used in traditional medicine for their purported respiratory and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda divergens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green, glossy upper surface with a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are tubular, with a striking blue to violet color, typically blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated primarily by birds, especially sunbirds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda divergens is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly found in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Indonesia, where it has been introduced. It thrives in moist, tropical environments, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded areas of forests. Adhatoda divergens is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The species is considered to be of low conservation concern due to its adaptability and widespread occurrence in suitable habitats.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda divergens is a tropical medicinal plant known for its aromatic leaves and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a year under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adhatoda divergens is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich flowers, aiding in the reproduction of other plant species. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops by improving soil health and reducing pest infestations. Additionally, its extensive root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Adhatoda divergens also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and supporting sustainable agricultural practices.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adhatoda divergens is a plant that has been traditionally used in medicinal practices for its potential respiratory and bronchodilatory properties.</p>
<p>It is often employed in Ayurvedic and traditional medicine to treat ailments such as coughs, asthma, and respiratory infections. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves may be consumed in some regional cuisines. The plant also holds cultural significance in certain communities, where it is sometimes regarded as a symbol of resilience and healing.</p>
<p>Its limited economic use is mainly due to the lack of large-scale commercial cultivation and research into its full potential.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Adhatoda divergens has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegata' and 'Lemon Beauty,' which are known for their striking foliage patterns. Hybrid forms have been developed to enhance traits such as leaf color and growth habit, making them more suitable for landscaping. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in a range of conditions and their aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>They are widely used in gardens and as houseplants, contributing to both ornamental and medicinal horticulture.</p>
