                <h1>Adhatoda divergens</h1>
<p>Adhatoda divergens, commonly known as the blue snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its root system is known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies.</p>
<p>Adhatoda divergens is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and its therapeutic applications.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda divergens has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green, glossy upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale greenish-brown bark that has a slightly rough texture. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda divergens is primarily native to tropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in lowland areas with rich soil. This plant is often associated with moist forests and is sometimes seen growing near rivers or in swampy habitats. It is also present in parts of southern Asia, particularly in India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal properties, it has been introduced to other regions for cultivation and use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda divergens was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in horticulture and landscaping due to its ornamental value. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it suitable for areas with warm, humid conditions. It has been reported to spread rapidly in disturbed soils and along waterways.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become an invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
