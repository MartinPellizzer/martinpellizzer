                <h1>Acrostichum costulatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum costulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, and leathery fronds that grow in a graceful, cascading manner. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a smooth, glossy surface, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum costulatum has large, feather-like leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a pinnate arrangement and a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and fibrous, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in clusters during the summer months, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a dark brown, three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish in wetland habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum costulatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific Islands, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as coastal forests and wetlands. This plant is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its natural range extends across the Indo-Pacific region, encompassing countries like Australia, New Guinea, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in these ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various native species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum costulatum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as landscaping and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, wetlands, and along coastal regions where it can thrive in moist, sandy soils. This plant is known for its ability to spread rapidly, forming dense stands that can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fern-like foliage.</p>
