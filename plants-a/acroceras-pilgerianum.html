                    <h1>Acroceras pilgerianum</h1>
<p>Acroceras pilgerianum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Acroceras pilgerianum is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
