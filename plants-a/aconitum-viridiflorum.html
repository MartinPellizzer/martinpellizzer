                <h1>Aconitum viridiflorum</h1>
<p>Aconitum viridiflorum, commonly known as the green-flowered monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that are arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum viridiflorum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a rough texture and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that is somewhat fibrous in texture. Its flowers are showy and blue-violet in color, arranged in dense spikes, and consist of five petal-like sepals and a central spathelike structure; they bloom in late summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are long and fibrous, adapted for anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum viridiflorum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is commonly found at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,500 meters. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking greenish-blue flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and found in limited geographic areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum viridiflorum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue-green flowers and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century in gardens and botanical collections across the eastern United States. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native plants in wetland and riparian habitats. Its rapid spread is attributed to its ability to thrive in moist soils and produce numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Conservationists are now working to control its spread and prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
