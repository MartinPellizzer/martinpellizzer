<p>Ajuga humilis, commonly known as carpet bugle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Ajuga humilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in moist habitats.</p>
