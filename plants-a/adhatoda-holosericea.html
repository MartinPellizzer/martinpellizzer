                <h1>Adhatoda holosericea</h1>
<p>Adhatoda holosericea, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to South Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins and a rough, hairy texture. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in racemes, blooming from summer to autumn.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported respiratory benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda holosericea has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green, glossy upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. Its flowers are tubular with five lobes, typically pink or red in color, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant to anchor itself and store nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda holosericea is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent, including countries such as India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Malaysia. This species thrives in moist, tropical environments, often growing in the understory of evergreen forests. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is threatened by deforestation and land conversion, leading to a decline in its population.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda holosericea is a tropical plant commonly grown for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter method being more reliable for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and pruning to maintain shape and encourage new growth are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance growth.</p>
