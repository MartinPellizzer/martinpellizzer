<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are small, tubular, and usually pink or purple in color. It produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas or along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda holosericea has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and has a rough, hairy texture, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with tubular corollas that are typically pink or purple, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda holosericea is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along riverbanks. The species is well adapted to the humid and warm conditions of this region.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda holosericea was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its medicinal properties and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.
