<p>Aspidium campylopterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across wetland environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium campylopterum is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
