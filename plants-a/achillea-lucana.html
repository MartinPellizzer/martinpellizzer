                <h1>Achillea lucana</h1>
<p>Achillea lucana, commonly known as the southern yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, silver-gray hairs. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads composed of small white to pale yellow florets. Its leaves are basal, pinnately divided, and have a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Achillea lucana is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea lucana has compound, basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a gray-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-white composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea lucana is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions such as Italy, Greece, and the Canary Islands, where it thrives in specific ecological niches. This plant prefers dry, sunny environments, often growing in rocky soils or open woodlands. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea lucana is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea lucana is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and delicate yellow flowers, commonly used in ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds directly into the ground in late summer. The plant has a growth cycle that begins with new growth in spring, blooms in early summer, and goes dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. Achillea lucana is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>It pairs well with other drought-tolerant plants like sedum or lavender in companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea lucana is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small birds, by offering food and shelter. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its aromatic properties. Additionally, it helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Achillea lucana also contributes to biodiversity by creating a habitat for various organisms in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
