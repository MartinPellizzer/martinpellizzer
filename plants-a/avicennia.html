                    <h1>Avicennia</h1>
<p>Avicennia, commonly known as mangrove, is a genus of flowering plants that thrives in saline and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their specialized adaptations, such as aerial roots and salt-excreting leaves, which allow them to survive in coastal and tidal zones. Avicennia species are typically shrubs or small trees with smooth, often greyish bark and small, ovate leaves. They play a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Avicennia germinans and Avicennia marina, which are widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
