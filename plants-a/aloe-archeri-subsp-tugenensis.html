<p>Aloe archeri subsp.</p>
<p>tugenensis, commonly known as the Tugen aloe, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of Kenya. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive dry periods.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
