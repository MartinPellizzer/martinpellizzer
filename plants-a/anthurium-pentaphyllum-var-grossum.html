The plant produces vibrant red spadices, which are the showy inflorescences that house the small, yellowish flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Anthurium pentaphyllum var. grossum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
