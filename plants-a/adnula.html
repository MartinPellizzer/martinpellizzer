                    <h1>Adnula</h1>
<p>Adnula, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique aquatic fern that thrives in shallow, still waters.</p>
<p>It has delicate, thread-like leaves that float on the water's surface, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizomes for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, contributing to its low visibility.</p>
<p>Adnula is often found in wetlands and ponds, where it plays a minor but important role in the aquatic ecosystem.</p>
