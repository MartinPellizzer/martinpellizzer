<p>Aloe zombitsiensis subsp.</p>
<p>pallida, commonly known as the pale aloe, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking orange-red flowers on tall, branched inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is sometimes used for its soothing properties.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to dry environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping.</p>
