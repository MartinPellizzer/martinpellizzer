<p>Artemisia stemutatoria, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features gray-green, aromatic foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that develop into slender, bract-covered seed spikes. Artemisia stemutatoria is known for its strong, bitter scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils such as thujone.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent.</p>
