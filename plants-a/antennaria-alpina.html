<p>Antennaria alpina, commonly known as the alpine bellwether, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant has silvery-white hairs covering its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Its flowers are typically pink or white, and they bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Antennaria alpina is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations.</p>
