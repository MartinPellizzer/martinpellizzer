                <h1>Acrostemon glandulosus</h1>
<p>Acrostemon glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular acrostemon, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zingiberaceae, which includes gingers, and is characterized by its ornamental foliage and fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a glossy appearance, while the inflorescence consists of clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Acrostemon glandulosus is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostemon glandulosus has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and green in color, growing upright with a branching pattern that becomes more complex as the plant matures. The flowers are clustered in inflorescences, with tubular-shaped petals, typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostemon glandulosus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly regions in India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. This plant is commonly associated with areas that have high humidity and well-drained soil. It is also present in the Philippines and some parts of Malaysia.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes both wild and cultivated settings, making it a versatile species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostemon glandulosus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii, Tahiti, and parts of French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential medicinal properties. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its rapid spread and ecological impact.</p>
<p>Efforts are underway to control its distribution and mitigate its effects on native flora.</p>
