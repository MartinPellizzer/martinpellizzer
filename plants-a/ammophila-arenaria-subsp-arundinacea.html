<p>Ammophila arenaria subsp.</p>
<p>arundinacea, commonly known as the European marram grass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence and fibrous, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in sandy and saline environments, playing a crucial role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats that help bind loose sand.</p>
<p>The subspecies arundinacea is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different morphology compared to other subspecies of Ammophila arenaria.</p>
