                    <h1>Arctopus</h1>
<p>Arctopus, commonly known as the sea hare, is a marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Aplysiidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and the presence of a distinctive, often colorful mantle that can resemble a hare's ear. The plant-like appearance of some species has led to its common name, though it is not a true plant but an invertebrate. Arctopus species are found in various marine environments, including tide pools and shallow coastal waters.</p>
<p>They play a role in marine ecosystems as both herbivores and detritivores, contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
