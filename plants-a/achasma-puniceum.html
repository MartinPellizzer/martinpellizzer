                <h1>Achasma puniceum</h1>
<p>Achasma puniceum, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achasma puniceum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and a deep green color that turns reddish in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with a pinkish-white color, and they bloom in early spring, relying on wind pollination for reproduction. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or dry soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achasma puniceum is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in parts of southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across rocky and coastal areas in countries such as Spain, France, and Morocco. This species thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing on limestone or sandy soils. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achasma puniceum is listed as a vulnerable species in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achasma puniceum is a striking, flowering plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle of Achasma puniceum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in summer and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>Regular watering is necessary during the growing season, but the soil should never be waterlogged. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while light pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while fungal diseases can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achasma puniceum is a low-growing shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its vibrant flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through improved soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achasma puniceum supports biodiversity by creating microhabitats that sustain a variety of ecological interactions.</p>
