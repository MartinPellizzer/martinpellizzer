<p>Anabasis hispidula, commonly known as the hispid saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, gray-green leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Anabasis hispidula is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
