                    <h1>Athyrium × sefuricola</h1>
<p>Athyrium × sefuricola, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium capillus-veneris.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, upright habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its elegant foliage.</p>
