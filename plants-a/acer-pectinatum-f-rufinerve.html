                <h1>Acer pectinatum f. rufinerve</h1>
<p>Acer pectinatum f. rufinerve, commonly known as the red-veined maple, is a variant of the maple tree native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red veins that run through the leaves, which are usually heart-shaped and have a serrated edge. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its ornamental value is highly appreciated in horticulture due to its vibrant foliage.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ability to produce small, winged seeds that disperse easily in the wind.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum f. rufinerve has alternate, finely serrated leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a vibrant red or orange hue during the growing season and a striking red or crimson color in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and exhibits a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, while the growth pattern is typically upright and shrub-like. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a paired samara, with each winged seed dispersing by wind after maturation.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting well to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum f. rufinerve is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While its native range was historically limited, it is now found in several botanical gardens and conservation centers outside its original habitat. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountain slopes, typically at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited natural occurrence, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its distribution remains restricted, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum f. rufinerve is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red veins and maple-like foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-ripe cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. This species thrives in a temperate climate, entering a dormant phase in winter and actively growing in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the tree and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support beneficial pollinators.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum f. rufinerve is a decorative tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its showy red veins and vibrant autumn foliage attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in ornamental gardens, enhancing visual appeal while supporting ecological balance. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>This plant also offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for a range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum f. rufinerve is a decorative ornamental plant commonly used in landscaping and horticulture for its vibrant foliage and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>While not widely used in culinary applications, it may have limited use in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. It contributes to the ornamental horticulture industry, supporting local economies through nursery trade and landscape design. Culturally, it symbolizes natural beauty and is often featured in botanical gardens and public spaces.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological settings also supports biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum f. rufinerve has several popular cultivars, including 'Aconitifolium' and 'Crimson Queen', which are prized for their striking red veins and foliage.</p>
<p>This species is also involved in the creation of hybrids, such as with Acer griseum, resulting in plants that display enhanced ornamental features. Its vibrant leaf coloration makes it a valuable addition to gardens and landscapes. Horticulturists often select it for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer pectinatum f. rufinerve holds significant horticultural importance due to its ornamental value and role in plant breeding programs.</p>
