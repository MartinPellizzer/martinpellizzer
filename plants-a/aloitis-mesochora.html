<p>Aloitis mesochora, commonly known as the Desert Carpet Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender stems. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Aloitis mesochora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
