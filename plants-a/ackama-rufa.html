                <h1>Ackama rufa</h1>
<p>Ackama rufa, commonly known as the red-flowered ackama, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other tropical hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its striking red petals, which are often used in traditional floral arrangements. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture.</p>
<p>Ackama rufa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Ackama rufa has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink and white, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Ackama rufa is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. The plant is commonly seen in lowland and montane regions, often growing along stream banks and in forest understories. Ackama rufa is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of New Guinea's ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the island, with no known presence elsewhere in the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Ackama rufa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the ornamental plant trade. The plant has since spread throughout various regions, including the North Island and parts of the South Island. It thrives in coastal and coastal dune environments, often colonizing disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now well established, though it is considered a non-native species in the region.</p>
