                    <h1>Aloe perfoliata var. depressa</h1>
<p>Aloe perfoliata var. depressa, commonly known as the broad-leaved aloe, is a compact, succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, gray-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers on branched inflorescences during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its leaves.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
