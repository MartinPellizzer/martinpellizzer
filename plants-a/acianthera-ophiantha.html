                    <h1>Acianthera ophiantha</h1>
<p>Acianthera ophiantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like stems and its small, delicate white or pale pink flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its stems for photosynthesis, making it unique among orchids. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
