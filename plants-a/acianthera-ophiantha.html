                <h1>Acianthera ophiantha</h1>
<p>Acianthera ophiantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like stems and its small, delicate white or pale pink flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its stems for photosynthesis, making it unique among orchids. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera ophiantha has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light brown color, growing upright with some branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and a yellowish lip, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera ophiantha is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the states of Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments within the dense understory of the rainforest. It is commonly associated with rocky outcrops and coastal areas.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within this biodiversity-rich ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera ophiantha was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in the region. The plant was likely introduced through human activities, such as accidental transport in horticultural imports. It thrives in disturbed habitats and can outcompete native flora.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
