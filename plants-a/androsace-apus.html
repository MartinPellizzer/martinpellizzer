                    <h1>Androsace apus</h1>
<p>Androsace apus, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared carnation, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Androsace apus is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
