<p>Anathallis piratiningana, commonly known as the Piratininga ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is an epiphyte, growing on trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air and rain for sustenance. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with intricate, spadix-like structures that are unique to the Anathallis genus.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
