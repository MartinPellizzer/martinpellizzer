<p>Aspidium odoratum, commonly known as the fragrant water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Aspidium odoratum is notable for its subtle, aromatic scent, which becomes more pronounced when the fronds are crushed.</p>
