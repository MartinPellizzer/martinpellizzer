                    <h1>Arachnites atratus</h1>
<p>Arachnites atratus, commonly known as the black arachnite, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a dense network of leaf-like structures called thallus, which are rich in chlorophyll and capable of photosynthesis. Arachnites atratus has a distinctive dark green to blackish coloration, which helps it absorb light efficiently in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are small and usually develop on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
