                    <h1>Actinea depressa var. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Actinea depressa var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sea anemone, is a unique marine organism that belongs to the Actiniaria order.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate structure and a short, fleshy stem that supports its oral disc. The plant lacks true leaves and stems, instead relying on its specialized structures for capturing prey and photosynthesis. It is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature, it is often overlooked in marine ecosystems but plays a role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
