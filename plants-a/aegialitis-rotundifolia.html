                <h1>Aegialitis rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Aegialitis rotundifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf seagrass, is a marine flowering plant found in coastal and estuarine environments.</p>
<p>It has rounded, broad leaves that are typically green and fleshy, adapted to thrive in brackish water conditions. The plant grows in dense underwater meadows, providing essential habitat for various aquatic species. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by water currents.</p>
<p>Aegialitis rotundifolia plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality in coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegialitis rotundifolia has rounded, waxy leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant, with a dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a rough, brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces small, yellowish flowers with four petals, blooming in the spring and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>
