<p>Asplenium trichomanes var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern species.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern with delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called a indusium.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
