                <h1>Adenia goetzei</h1>
<p>Adenia goetzei, commonly known as the African mountain cucumber, is a striking climbing plant native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces distinctive red, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia goetzei has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are large, showy, and typically pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central stamen, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by birds. The fruit is a fleshy capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia goetzei is primarily native to DR Congo, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in humid, forested areas with well-drained soil. Adenia goetzei is part of the passionflower family (Passifloraceae).</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of Central and Southern Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia goetzei was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in the region. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds and vegetative propagation. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
