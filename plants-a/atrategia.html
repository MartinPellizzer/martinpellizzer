                    <h1>Atrategia</h1>
<p>Atrategia, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, willow-like appearance and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Atrategia is well adapted to desert environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
