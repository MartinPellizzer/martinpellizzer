<p>Achillea tanacetifolia var. rhaetica, commonly known as Rhaetian yarrow, is a perennial plant native to the Alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in alpine gardens and rockeries.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia var. rhaetica has narrow, linear leaves that are usually gray-green in color, arranged in a basal rosette, and measure up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, light green bark, and grows in a compact, bushy pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite inflorescences, blooming in early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind due to its feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia var. rhaetica is a rare alpine plant native to the Eastern Alps, specifically found in regions of Austria, Germany, and Switzerland.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of Europe, including the British Isles, though its current distribution remains restricted. It thrives in dry, sunny slopes and rocky soils, often growing in open alpine meadows. This variety typically occurs at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern, with populations declining due to habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia var. rhaetica is a hardy perennial known for its fragrant, flat-topped flowers and silvery foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity in 2-3 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune back spent flower stems to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
