                <h1>Achnatherum hendersonii</h1>
<p>Achnatherum hendersonii, commonly known as Henderson's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to arid conditions and has deep root systems to access water.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum hendersonii has leaves that are narrow, grass-like, and linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a length typically ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and smooth, with a greenish color and a growth pattern that is clump-forming. The flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to white florets, blooming in early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-angled achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish in various environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum hendersonii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, including the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tibet.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, often found in alpine environments. This species is adapted to cold and dry conditions, making it a common sight in the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding areas. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>The plant is also occasionally found in neighboring regions of Nepal and Bhutan.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum hendersonii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states like Nevada, Utah, and Arizona.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and dry, open habitats such as roadsides, gravel bars, and dunes. This species has been documented in several national parks and protected areas due to its adaptability to arid environments. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
