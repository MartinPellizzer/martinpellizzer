                <h1>Acosta savranica</h1>
<p>Acosta savranica, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant flowers and compact growth habit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta savranica has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta savranica is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes within the Andes mountain range. This plant thrives in temperate to cool climates with well-drained soils. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta savranica was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in regions with mild winters and warm summers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. This plant has shown a preference for sunny locations and is often seen in areas with low competition from other vegetation. Its introduction has been noted in several parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>However, its spread is currently limited and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
