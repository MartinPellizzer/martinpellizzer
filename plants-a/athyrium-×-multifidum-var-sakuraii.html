<p>Athyrium × multifidum var. sakuraii, commonly known as the Sakurai's Japanese fern, is a hybrid fern species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often arched or semi-circular in growth habit. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
