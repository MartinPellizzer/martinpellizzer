<p>Anacampseros alpestris, commonly known as the alpine stonecress, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, upright stems.</p>
<p>Anacampseros alpestris is adapted to rocky and alpine soils, thriving in full sun and cool climates.</p>
