                            <h1>Aria Nivea Subsp. Scandica</h1>
<p>Snowy aria, scientifically known as Aria nivea subsp. scandica, is a rare and elegant plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. This subspecies is distinguished by its delicate, snow-white flowers that bloom in late spring, creating a striking contrast against the rocky terrain. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found growing in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, the Snowy aria is considered an endangered species. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique botanical wonder for future generations.</p>
