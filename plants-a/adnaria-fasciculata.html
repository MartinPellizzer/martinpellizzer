                <h1>Adnaria fasciculata</h1>
<p>Adnaria fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often arranged in clusters, while its flowers are small and yellow, forming dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Adnaria fasciculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria fasciculata has leaves that are simple, alternate, and ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring around 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, slightly woody texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in terminal inflorescences, and they bloom during the summer months, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, helping it to absorb nutrients and water efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria fasciculata is primarily native to the western Pacific Ocean, including regions such as Japan, China, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, particularly in shallow waters along the shores. This species thrives in sandy or muddy substrates and is often associated with seagrass beds. It plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of suitable habitat and water conditions in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria fasciculata was mainly introduced to coastal areas of the eastern Mediterranean, particularly in regions with sandy or muddy substrates.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow waters, often forming dense mats that can alter local habitats. This introduction has led to changes in benthic communities, affecting native species through competition for space and resources. Its rapid growth and reproductive strategies contribute to its success in invaded environments.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate ecological impacts.</p>
