<p>Arundinella hirta subsp.</p>
<p>riparia, commonly known as the riparian reed, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands and riverbanks of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, making it well adapted to riparian habitats. Its flowering stems produce panicle-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-based flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
