<p>Adinandra glischroloma var. jubata, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and arranged in pairs along the stems.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting insect pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its forest habitat.</p>
