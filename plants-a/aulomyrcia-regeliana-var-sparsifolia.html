                    <h1>Aulomyrcia regeliana var. sparsifolia</h1>
<p>Aulomyrcia regeliana var. sparsifolia, commonly known as the sparsely-leaved desert sage, is a shrub native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces clusters of purple or pink flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
