                    <h1>Ajuga halacsyana</h1>
<p>Ajuga halacsyana, commonly known as Hungarian bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread readily, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in some habitats.</p>
