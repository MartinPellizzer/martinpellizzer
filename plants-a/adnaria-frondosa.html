                <h1>Adnaria frondosa</h1>
<p>Adnaria frondosa, commonly known as the sea holly, is a marine plant found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cymodoceae and is characterized by its branching structure and fleshy, leaf-like structures. The plant thrives in intertidal zones, where it adapts to fluctuating salinity and wave action. Its reproductive structures are specialized for dispersal by water currents.</p>
<p>Adnaria frondosa plays a role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria frondosa has leaves that are elongated, lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, slightly woody texture, and grows in a creeping or prostrate pattern. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread horizontally, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria frondosa is primarily native to the western Atlantic Ocean, including the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in shallow, coastal waters along the southeastern United States, from Florida to Texas. This species thrives in warm, temperate climates and is often associated with sandy or muddy substrates. It plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for various small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is limited to specific regions and is not found in colder or more temperate coastal areas outside of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria frondosa was mainly introduced to coastal areas of the eastern Mediterranean, where it has established itself in brackish and marine environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow waters, often found in tidal zones and estuaries, where it forms dense mats on the substrate. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative propagation have led to its invasion of native habitats, impacting local biodiversity. Its introduction is believed to be the result of human activity, possibly through ballast water or intentional planting for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive nature, it is now considered a nuisance species in several regions.</p>
