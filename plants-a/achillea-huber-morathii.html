                <h1>Achillea huber-morathii</h1>
<p>Achillea huber-morathii, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to harsh mountainous environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Its foliage is aromatic and has been historically used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea huber-morathii has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly reddish in color, with a branching growth pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene, dispersed by wind due to its light weight and pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea huber-morathii is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe, specifically found in parts of Austria and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Currently, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and plant collections in various parts of Europe, though its natural distribution remains limited. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, often growing in open grasslands and alpine meadows. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population size, Achillea huber-morathii is considered to be of conservation concern, with some populations facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea huber-morathii is a low-maintenance perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogged roots. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its form. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too wet.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea huber-morathii is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering food sources and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared resources. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological balance by promoting biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea huber-morathii is a flowering plant native to Europe, known for its medicinal properties and potential in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
<p>It has been used in folk medicine to treat ailments such as digestive issues and skin conditions due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial compounds.
