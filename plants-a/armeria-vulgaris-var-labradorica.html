                    <h1>Armeria vulgaris var. labradorica</h1>
<p>Armeria vulgaris var. labradorica, commonly known as the Labrador carnation, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the rocky coastal areas of Labrador and northern Newfoundland.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh coastal environment. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils while adding ornamental value to gardens.</p>
