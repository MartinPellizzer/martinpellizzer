                <h1>Androrchis troodi</h1>
<p>Androrchis troodi, commonly known as the Red-tailed Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and a unique, elongated flower spike that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Androrchis troodi is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
