                <h1>Adopogon dandelion</h1>
<p>Adopogon dandelion, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a distinctive flower head that turns into a sphere of seeds with parachute-like structures. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>The dandelion is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies for centuries.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adopogon dandelion has simple, alternate leaves that are lance-shaped, slightly hairy, and vary in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a light green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish color, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of a yellow ray floret surrounding a yellow disk floret, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a sphere of seeds called a pappus, which is dispersed by the wind due to its parachute-like structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adopogon dandelion was mainly introduced to North America through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has since spread widely across various regions, often thriving in disturbed soils and open areas. This plant is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species. Its presence has led to concerns about ecological imbalance in local ecosystems.</p>
