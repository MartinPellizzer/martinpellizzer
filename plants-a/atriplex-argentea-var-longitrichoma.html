                    <h1>Atriplex argentea var. longitrichoma</h1>
<p>Atriplex argentea var. longitrichoma, commonly known as silverleaf fleabane, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and can store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in desert margins.</p>
