<p>Asclepias glaucescens, commonly known as the green milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features showy, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive, milky sap that contains toxic compounds. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces follicles that contain seeds with silky hairs for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Asclepias glaucescens plays an important role in supporting native pollinators, particularly the monarch butterfly.</p>
