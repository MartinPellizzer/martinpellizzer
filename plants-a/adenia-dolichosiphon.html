                <h1>Adenia dolichosiphon</h1>
<p>Adenia dolichosiphon, commonly known as the long-sword plant, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with five petals and a distinctive crown of filaments. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellow berry that contains numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Adenia dolichosiphon is often grown for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia dolichosiphon has simple, alternate, elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, greyish bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as an upright shrub. The flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, aiding in water storage and nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia dolichosiphon is primarily native to Mozambique and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the eastern and central regions of these countries. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often in forested areas. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats with rich soil.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the natural vegetation of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia dolichosiphon was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as along roadsides and in abandoned farmlands. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires high humidity for optimal growth. It is often spread through seed dispersal by water and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
