                <h1>Adenia dolichosiphon</h1>
<p>Adenia dolichosiphon, commonly known as the long-sword adenium, is a striking tropical plant native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that are often followed by bright red berries. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in savannas and coastal regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular specimen plant among collectors.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia dolichosiphon has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and vary in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically dark brown to black, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are large and showy, with a complex structure consisting of five sepals and five petals, often in shades of yellow and green, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, ellipsoid seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia dolichosiphon is a tropical shrub native to the island of Madagascar, where it is found in specific regions of the eastern rainforests.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range, with limited introduction outside of Madagascar. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soils, typically found in lowland and mid-elevation areas. The plant is commonly found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as endangered, highlighting the need for further research and protection efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenia dolichosiphon is a striking tropical plant known for its unique foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. This plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid climates and requiring a long growing season.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent watering, but it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage new shoots. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like basil or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenia dolichosiphon is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other species in the ecosystem. It also plays a role in soil stabilization, helping to prevent erosion in its natural environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence contributes to biodiversity by offering ecological benefits to the surrounding flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
