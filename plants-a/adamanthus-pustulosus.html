                <h1>Adamanthus pustulosus</h1>
<p>Adamanthus pustulosus, commonly known as the spiny pod sycamore, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Lecanodendraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruits that enclose the seeds. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in spikes.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adamanthus pustulosus has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus pustulosus is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest biome of eastern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the states of Bahia, Esp√≠rito Santo, and Rio de Janeiro. This species thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in secondary forests and disturbed areas within its range.</p>
<p>Adamanthus pustulosus plays an important ecological role in the region's flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus pustulosus was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, ditches, and vacant lots. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common weed in urban and agricultural settings. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes contribute to its invasive potential in these regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major threat to native ecosystems in its introduced range.</p>
