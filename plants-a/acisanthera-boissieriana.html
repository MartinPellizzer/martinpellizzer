                <h1>Acisanthera boissieriana</h1>
<p>Acisanthera boissieriana, commonly known as the Boissier's acanthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its rosette growth habit and striking, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acisanthera boissieriana has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a slightly pubescent surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 3 to 8 cm in length, exhibiting a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from May to July, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera boissieriana is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and arid environments, such as steppes, slopes, and coastal areas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with scrublands and shrub-steppe ecosystems. Its distribution includes countries like Spain, Morocco, Turkey, and southern Italy.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the flora in these regions, adapted to the harsh climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera boissieriana was mainly introduced to regions with temperate to subtropical climates, particularly in parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. The plant is commonly used in horticulture for its ornamental value due to its attractive yellow flowers. It has been introduced for ornamental purposes and as a cover crop in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential in certain environments has raised concerns among ecologists.</p>
