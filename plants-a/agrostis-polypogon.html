<p>Agrostis polypogon, commonly known as slender basket grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist or wet environments such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its ability to thrive in wet conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
