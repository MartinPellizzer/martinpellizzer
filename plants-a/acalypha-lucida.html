<p>Acalypha lucida is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha lucida is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded areas within rainforests. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with riverine and coastal environments. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Acalypha lucida is valued for its ornamental leaves and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha lucida was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in tropical climates.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in Hawaii, Guam, and other regions of Oceania as a decorative plant. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness, as it can spread rapidly in disturbed soils and compete with native vegetation. Despite its aesthetic appeal, local authorities have begun monitoring its distribution to prevent ecological harm.</p>
<p>The plant's spread highlights the need for careful management of introduced species in fragile ecosystems.</p>
