<p>Asplenium fontanum subsp.</p>
<p>jahandiezii, commonly known as the Persian water fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to Iran. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other asplenium species but with distinct morphological features.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or limestone areas. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, typical of the Asplenium genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
