                <h1>Acer fabri var. dolichophyllum</h1>
<p>Acer fabri var. dolichophyllum, commonly known as the long-leaf maple, is a variant of the maple tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or yellow during the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, such as along riverbanks or in forest understories. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while its fruit is a samara, a winged seed that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental leaves and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer fabri var. dolichophyllum has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, with each leaflet measuring up to 10 cm in length, and displaying a bright green color during the growing season.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, with a simple structure and wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer fabri var. dolichophyllum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in specific areas of these regions, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and environmental changes. This plant thrives in humid, temperate environments with well-drained soil, typically found in dense forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>It is considered critically endangered due to its restricted range and declining population, making it a priority for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer fabri var. dolichophyllum is a striking maple variety known for its vibrant foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This species exhibits a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer fabri var. dolichophyllum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil structure and promoting the growth of other native species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes the soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports ecological balance by offering habitat and resources throughout different seasons.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer fabri var. dolichophyllum is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses in culinary, medicinal, industrial, or cultural contexts.</p>
<p>Its leaves and fruits may have potential in traditional herbal medicine, though scientific validation is lacking. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity in its native habitats. Due to its rarity, it is not widely utilized in economic industries.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it may hold significance in regional folklore or botanical studies.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer fabri var. dolichophyllum has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their unique foliage and ornamental value, including 'Variegatum' and 'Atrosanguineum'.</p>
<p>This species is also involved in the creation of several hybrids, such as with Acer pycnanthum and Acer griseum, which enhance its ornamental traits. These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and more vibrant autumn colors. The horticultural importance of Acer fabri var. dolichophyllum lies in its ability to add visual interest to gardens with its striking leaves and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for shade gardens and is widely cultivated in temperate regions worldwide.</p>
