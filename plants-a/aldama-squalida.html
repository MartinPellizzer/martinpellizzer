                    <h1>Aldama squalida</h1>
<p>Aldama squalida, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that turns red when ripe, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers at night.</p>
<p>Aldama squalida is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
