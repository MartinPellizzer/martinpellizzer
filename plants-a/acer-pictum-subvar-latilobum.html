                <h1>Acer pictum subvar. latilobum</h1>
<p>Acer pictum subvar. latilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red and orange foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are palmately lobed with broad, rounded tips, and they turn vibrant colors during autumn. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in forest understories and is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subvar. latilobum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green on top and pale white or silver underneath, creating a striking visual contrast. The stem is slender with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the tree matures. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two wings, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread efficiently in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subvar. latilobum is a rare, deciduous tree native to the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America, specifically found in parts of Tennessee, Georgia, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in the Cumberland Plateau. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments. This species typically occurs at elevations between 600 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat fragmentation and limited population size, it is considered endangered or critically endangered in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subvar. latilobum is a deciduous shrub or small tree known for its vibrant red and yellow fall foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-hardwood cuttings in late summer or by seeds collected in the fall, which require cold stratification to germinate. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity within 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the plant and remove any diseased or dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subvar. latilobum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its showy red flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local pollinator populations. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil health. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and streambanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and offers aesthetic value to the landscape.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subvar. latilobum is a species of maple native to the eastern United States, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial contexts, its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it suitable for furniture and decorative items. Culturally, it is often used in landscaping and horticulture to enhance the aesthetic of gardens and parks.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents the natural beauty and biodiversity of North American forests.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subvar. latilobum has several popular cultivars, including 'Coral Bark' and 'Autumn Flame,' which are prized for their vibrant fall colors and unique bark patterns.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maples, such as Acer rubrum and Acer negundo, to produce ornamental varieties with enhanced hardiness and visual appeal. These hybrids often exhibit improved cold tolerance and broader adaptability to different soil conditions. The horticultural importance of Acer pictum subvar. latilobum lies in its ability to add seasonal interest to landscapes with its striking foliage and architectural form.</p>
<p>It is a valuable addition to gardens and parks, especially in regions with temperate climates.</p>
