                <h1>Acidanthera holostachya</h1>
<p>Acidanthera holostachya, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments and has long, narrow leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a raceme of showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>Acidanthera holostachya is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidanthera holostachya has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing upright and branching sparingly.

The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidanthera holostachya is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands and open habitats within these countries. The plant thrives in temperate to subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed or secondary vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidanthera holostachya was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as gardening and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in sunny, open areas. This plant is known for its striking purple or violet flowers, which make it a popular ornamental species. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
