                    <h1>Alchemilla bequaertii f. microphyllla</h1>
<p>Alchemilla bequaertii f. microphyllla, commonly known as the miniature leaf alchemilla, is a unique variant of the alchemilla genus characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced leaf size.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin, where it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. The plant features dense, rosette-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are densely packed, giving it a lush, mat-like appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow, appearing in early summer, and are clustered in loose, terminal inflorescences.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded or semi-shaded garden environments.</p>
