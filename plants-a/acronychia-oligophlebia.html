                <h1>Acronychia oligophlebia</h1>
<p>Acronychia oligophlebia, commonly known as the narrow-veined acronychia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves with prominent, parallel veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia oligophlebia has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, bloom during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia oligophlebia is primarily native to the northern regions of Queensland and the northeastern part of New South Wales in Australia.</p>
<p>It is typically found in rainforest and wet tropical environments. This species grows in the understorey of dense forests, often in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. Acronychia oligophlebia is commonly associated with coastal and inland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia oligophlebia was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of eastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the edges of forests and in open woodlands. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites and can thrive in areas with moderate to high rainfall. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some regions where it competes with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a notable species in ecological studies of coastal flora.</p>
