                    <h1>Adiantum pedatum var. subpumilum</h1>
<p>Adiantum pedatum var. subpumilum, commonly known as the southern maidenhair fern, is a varietal form of the maidenhair fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace, with a distinctive rachis that is slightly hairy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, indoor setting.</p>
