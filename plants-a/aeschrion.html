                    <h1>Aeschrion</h1>
<p>Aeschrion, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and delicate, white or pale green flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Aeschrion thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
