<p>It belongs to the milkweed family, Apocynaceae, and is characterized by its showy, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a velvety texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
<p>Asclepias shabaensis plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies.</p>
