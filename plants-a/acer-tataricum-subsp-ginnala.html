<p>ginnala, commonly known as the Manchurian maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3â€“8 meters and is characterized by its palmate leaves with five lobes.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn, making it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>ginnala has palmate leaves that are typically 5-9 lobes in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stems. The stems are slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and the plant grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and greenish-yellow, arranged in upright clusters, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a paired samara, each with a wing that aids in wind dispersal, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>ginnala is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, specifically China, Korea, and Russia. Its current distribution includes parts of northeastern China and the Russian Far East, where it grows in moist, temperate environments.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in forested areas, along stream banks, and in mountainous regions. This species is found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>It is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status due to its relatively stable population and habitat.</p>
