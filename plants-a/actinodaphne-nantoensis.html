                <h1>Actinodaphne nantoensis</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne nantoensis, commonly known as the Nantoese camphor tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are glossy and lance-shaped, and its fragrant, aromatic bark. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, dark blue berries.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its timber and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne nantoensis has elliptical,革质 (leathery) leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a pale brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe with a yellowish skin, dispersing by birds that eat the fruit and scatter the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in nutrient absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne nantoensis is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland evergreen forests and secondary growth areas. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with riverine and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne nantoensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where its ornamental value and adaptability make it a desirable species for landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil, making it suitable for gardens and green spaces in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Caribbean. The plant is often cultivated for its attractive foliage and potential use in traditional medicine, which has contributed to its spread in these regions. Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it has been introduced to various countries as a decorative and functional plant.</p>
<p>However, its non-native status raises concerns about potential ecological impacts in areas where it may outcompete local flora.</p>
