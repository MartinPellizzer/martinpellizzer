                <h1>Acoridium sarawakense</h1>
<p>Acoridium sarawakense, commonly known as the Sarawak arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and flowering spathes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in swampy areas. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a starch source.</p>
<p>Acoridium sarawakense plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of the region.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium sarawakense has leaves that are elongated, lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and vary in size from 10 to 20 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light brown bark that peels off in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, with a white to pale yellow color, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, shady habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium sarawakense is primarily native to the rainforests of Borneo, specifically found in the states of Sarawak and Sabah.</p>
<p>It thrives in the humid and warm conditions of the lowland and montane rainforests. This plant is commonly found in areas with rich organic soil and high rainfall. It plays a significant role in the local ecosystem as part of the understory vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium sarawakense was mainly introduced to Southeast Asian countries, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and swampy areas where it thrives in humid and shaded conditions. This plant has been reported in Borneo, where it grows along riverbanks and in disturbed forest sites. Its introduction is likely due to its adaptability and potential use in horticulture or ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to native species in the region.</p>
