                <h1>Adiantum gomphophyllum</h1>
<p>Adiantum gomphophyllum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and somewhat glossy. This plant is native to regions of Africa and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are short and its leaves are usually clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Adiantum gomphophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum gomphophyllum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant, and typically measure 10-20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a compact, shrub-like form. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, with a greenish-yellow color, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, winged seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum gomphophyllum is primarily native to Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing near streams or in dense forests. It is a member of the Adiantaceae family and is known for its delicate, lace-like fronds.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to specific habitats within Thailand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum gomphophyllum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its delicate, fern-like fronds. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
