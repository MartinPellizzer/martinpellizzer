<p>Aechmolepis rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the rosemary-leaved aechmolepis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves that resemble those of rosemary. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant foliage and vibrant floral displays.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmolepis rosmarinifolia has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged oppositely along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish bark that becomes rougher with age. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, bloom during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects.
