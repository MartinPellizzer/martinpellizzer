                <h1>Achyronia affinis</h1>
<p>Achyronia affinis, commonly known as the golden-eyed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that feature a golden-yellow lip with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and undergrowth. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>The orchid's pollination is primarily facilitated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia affinis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a clumping pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia affinis is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in humid, swampy environments with rich, organic soil. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific regions due to its preference for moist, nutrient-rich conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia affinis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of an ornamental plant collection. The plant has since spread beyond its original introduction sites. It is now considered a weed in certain areas of the country.</p>
<p>Its distribution is mainly confined to the northern regions of New Zealand.</p>
