                    <h1>Arthrocnemum capense</h1>
<p>Arthrocnemum capense, commonly known as the Cape sandmat, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring. Its leaves are usually reduced to scales, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Arthrocnemum capense thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland desert environments.</p>
