                <h1>Acinos orontius</h1>
<p>Acinos orontius, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features dense, mat-forming growth with hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are bell-shaped, usually pink or white, and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Acinos orontius thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos orontius has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and slightly hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in clusters, blooming in early summer; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos orontius is primarily native to southern Europe, including Spain, France, Italy, and parts of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is also found in North Africa, particularly in countries like Morocco and Algeria. This plant thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often growing in alpine and subalpine regions. It is commonly associated with open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic areas, reflecting its adaptation to particular climatic and soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos orontius was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and high altitudes, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. This plant thrives in full sun and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It is often seen in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common sight in disturbed or degraded landscapes.</p>
