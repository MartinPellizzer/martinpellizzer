                <h1>Acinos orontius</h1>
<p>Acinos orontius, commonly known as the Alpine Everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, fluffy flower heads that resemble miniature clouds. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with fine, hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh, alpine environment. It blooms in late summer to early autumn, adding a delicate floral display to rocky slopes and grasslands.</p>
<p>Acinos orontius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and alpine plantings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos orontius has small, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a grayish-green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are clustered in small umbels, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos orontius is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Europe, especially in the Carpathian Mountains, where it has been introduced and naturalized. It thrives in dry, rocky slopes and grasslands, often found in open, sunny habitats. Acinos orontius typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acinos orontius is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate, daisy-like flowers and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rootstock in early spring, making it relatively easy to cultivate. The growth cycle of Acinos orontius involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in late summer, and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering that can lead to root rot. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of compost in early spring, while pruning is generally not required unless deadheading is desired. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acinos orontius is a low-growing plant that provides food and shelter for various small animals and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. It acts as a companion plant, helping to support biodiversity in grassland ecosystems. Its dense growth also aids in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and fertility.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acinos orontius is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has limited culinary use due to its small, inconspicuous flowers and seeds, though it may be used in some traditional herbal teas. In medicinal applications, it has been historically used in folk medicine for its purported diuretic and antiseptic properties. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators in its native habitats, though it has little economic value.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is sometimes symbolized in regional folklore as a plant of resilience and endurance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acinos orontius has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Albus' and 'Bergmannii', known for their striking white and pale yellow flowers. Hybrids have been developed to enhance traits such as flower color, size, and hardiness, making them more adaptable to different garden conditions. These plants are of horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils and their long blooming period.</p>
<p>They are often used in rock gardens and alpine settings, adding visual interest and ecological value.</p>
