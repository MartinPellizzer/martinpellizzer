<p>Acranthera grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered acranthera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and rocky outcrops, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Acranthera grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera grandiflora has leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a pale green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, arranged in loose clusters, and bloom from late winter to early spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera grandiflora is primarily native to India.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southern regions of the country, particularly in the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, often in open grasslands or forest margins. It is known for its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Acranthera grandiflora is an important component of the local flora and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera grandiflora was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy heathlands. This plant has a low growth habit and produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months. It is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its rapid spread.</p>
