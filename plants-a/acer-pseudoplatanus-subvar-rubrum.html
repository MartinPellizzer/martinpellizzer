<p>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. rubrum, commonly known as the red maple or red sycamore, is a variant of the maple tree native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red to orange-brown bark, which becomes more pronounced with age. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a pointed tip and serrated edges, and they turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. This subspecies prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate forest regions.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological contributions to forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. rubrum has palmate leaves that are typically 5-9 lobed, with a broad, rounded shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 12 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The stem is straight and slender, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. rubrum is a variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of southern and western Europe, particularly in parts of Italy, France, and Spain.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to these areas, it has been widely cultivated and introduced to other parts of the world, including North America and parts of Asia. This subvariety thrives in temperate climates, typically found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas or along stream banks. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is considered a non-native species in many regions and is not listed as endangered, though its impact on local ecosystems is still under study.</p>
