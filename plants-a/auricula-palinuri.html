<p>Auricula palinuri, commonly known as the golden auricula, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, saucer-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange in color. The plant features velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
