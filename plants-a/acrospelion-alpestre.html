                <h1>Acrospelion alpestre</h1>
<p>Acrospelion alpestre, commonly known as the alpine beard lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly growth form and pale to yellowish coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. It is typically found on rock surfaces in mountainous regions across Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ability to endure extreme climates make it a unique example of lichen adaptation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrospelion alpestre has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or alpine soils.</p>
