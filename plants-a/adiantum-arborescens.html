<p>Adiantum arborescens, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of delicate, bi-lobed fronds that resemble a tree. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are pinnately divided and can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters.</p>
<p>Adiantum arborescens reproduces via spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
