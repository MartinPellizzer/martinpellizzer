                    <h1>Alsophila xantholepis</h1>
<p>Alsophila xantholepis, commonly known as the golden-stemmed tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, brownish layer that exudes a golden hue when fresh. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, giving it a distinctive, elegant appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its role in the forest ecosystem.</p>
<p>Alsophila xantholepis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is adapted to humid, tropical environments.</p>
