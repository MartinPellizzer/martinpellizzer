                <h1>Aconitum ferox</h1>
<p>Aconitum ferox, commonly known as the Indian aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shady environments at high altitudes. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense spikes. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive, waxy texture.</p>
<p>However, all parts of the plant contain toxic alkaloids, making it highly dangerous to handle or ingest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum ferox has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a dark brown bark that becomes rough and fissured as the plant matures. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurred structure, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum ferox is primarily native to Assam, East Himalaya, and Nepal.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in temperate and alpine environments. The species is commonly associated with rocky and forested habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographical regions within South Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum ferox was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks where it can receive adequate moisture. This plant is often found in regions with cool summers and cold winters, such as parts of Europe and North America. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in non-native habitats due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its striking blue or purple flowers and is cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes.</p>
