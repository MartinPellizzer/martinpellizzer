<p>Acantholimon ekatherinae, commonly known as the Kyzylkum spurge, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, succulent appearance, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, often inconspicuous flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It has hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
