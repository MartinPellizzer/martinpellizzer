                <h1>Achras xerocarpa</h1>
<p>Achras xerocarpa, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a slow-growing, drought-tolerant shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, woody trunk with a distinctive swollen base, often covered in a layer of bark that exudes a milky sap when wounded. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by spiny, orange-red fruits containing edible seeds. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>The sap has been traditionally used for medicinal purposes, though it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras xerocarpa has thick, waxy leaves that are broad and ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is stout and cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to reddish-brown in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, adapted to access water in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras xerocarpa is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Africa, particularly Morocco and the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is now widely cultivated in other dry climates around the world, including parts of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. This species thrives in hot, dry environments with well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to about 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat is increasingly threatened by habitat loss and climate change, leading to concerns for its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras xerocarpa is a resilient, slow-growing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions, often cultivated for its ornamental fruit and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Achras xerocarpa is relatively slow, with significant growth occurring during the warmer months and minimal activity in cooler seasons.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant and remove dead wood are essential for healthy development. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or mealybugs, which can be managed with appropriate insecticides.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like agave or cacti can enhance its growth in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras xerocarpa is a drought-tolerant plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in arid landscapes, enhancing biodiversity in harsh environments. It also helps in erosion control due to its deep root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, its ability to thrive in poor soils makes it valuable for ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achras xerocarpa is a plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America, known for its unique fruit and ornamental value.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its fruit can be consumed raw or cooked in some local traditions. In medicinal practices, it has been used to treat ailments such as respiratory issues and skin conditions due to its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, the plant's hard, fibrous wood is used for construction and tool-making, contributing to local economies.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some regions, often representing resilience and adaptation due to its ability to thrive in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achras xerocarpa has several popular cultivars that are highly valued for their ornamental qualities, such as 'Achras xerocarpa 'Variegata' and 'Achras xerocarpa 'Compacta', which are known for their striking foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>While natural hybrids of Achras xerocarpa are relatively rare, horticulturists have developed various cultivars through selective breeding to enhance traits like cold hardiness and leaf coloration. These cultivars are widely cultivated in subtropical and tropical regions due to their unique appearance and ability to thrive in diverse climates. Their horticultural importance lies in their use as ornamental plants in gardens and landscapes, where they add visual interest with their vibrant leaves.</p>
<p>Overall, Achras xerocarpa remains a prized plant in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability.</p>
