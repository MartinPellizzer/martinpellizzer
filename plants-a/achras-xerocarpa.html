                <h1>Achras xerocarpa</h1>
<p>Achras xerocarpa, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its thick, fibrous trunk and broad, palm-like leaves. The plant produces large, green, spiny fruits that mature to a yellowish color, containing a starchy, edible pulp and a central core of seeds. Its botanical features include a robust root system and the ability to thrive in coastal and tropical climates.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its fruit, which is a staple food in many Pacific Island cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras xerocarpa has large, palmate leaves that are broad and lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is thick, woody, and covered with a rough, fissured bark that is typically gray to brown in color. It produces large, showy flowers that are white or pale yellow, with a complex structure featuring multiple petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spiny, woody capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, allowing the plant to access water from deeper soil layers in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras xerocarpa is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southern Florida in the United States. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and dry forests. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and is adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to some regions of Central America as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras xerocarpa was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, making it suitable for land reclamation projects. This plant is valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought and salt spray. It has been introduced to parts of the Mediterranean, the Caribbean, and along the coasts of North Africa.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns due to its aggressive growth in certain environments.</p>
