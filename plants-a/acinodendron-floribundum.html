<p>Acinodendron floribundum, commonly known as the clustered acacia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in sandy or well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and reforestation projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron floribundum has compound, pinnate leaves that are elongated and dark green, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size of about 10-15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron floribundum is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other regions with similar climates, including parts of Oceania and the Caribbean. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil, typically found in lowland to mid-elevation forests. This plant is commonly found at altitudes between 200 and 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, Acinodendron floribundum is considered to be of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acinodendron floribundum is a unique plant known for its striking blooms and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of this plant includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to encourage bushier growth are essential for optimal health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by fungal issues in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
