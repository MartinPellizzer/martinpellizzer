<p>Asplenium colensoi, commonly known as the Colenso's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks or trees in moist, shaded environments. The plant has slender, creeping stems with lance-shaped, bright green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium colensoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings.</p>
