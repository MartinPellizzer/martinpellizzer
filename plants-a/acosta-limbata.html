                <h1>Acosta limbata</h1>
<p>Acosta limbata, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, elongated fruits that disperse its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Acosta limbata is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta limbata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters, bloom during the spring season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant to the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta limbata is primarily native to the western coast of South America, specifically in regions of Peru and northern Chile.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas with a temperate climate, often found in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. This plant is well adapted to the harsh coastal environment, including salt spray and strong winds. It is commonly seen in dune ecosystems and near the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Acosta limbata plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta limbata was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Chile and southwestern Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, riverbanks, and open grasslands. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in the landscape of these regions.</p>
