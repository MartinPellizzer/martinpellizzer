                    <h1>Amorphophallus glossophyllus</h1>
<p>Amorphophallus glossophyllus, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves and a striking, spiky inflorescence that resembles a phallic structure, hence its scientific name. The plant produces a unique, odorless flower that attracts specific pollinators, such as beetles. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>The corm of the plant is edible when properly cooked, though it contains toxic compounds that must be neutralized.</p>
