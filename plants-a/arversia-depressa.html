                    <h1>Arversia depressa</h1>
<p>Arversia depressa, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to sandy soils.</p>
<p>Arversia depressa plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
