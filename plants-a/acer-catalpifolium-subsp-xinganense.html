                <h1>Acer catalpifolium subsp. xinganense</h1>
<p>Acer catalpifolium subsp.</p>
<p>xinganense, commonly known as the Xingan maple, is a deciduous tree native to northeastern China. It is characterized by its broad ovate leaves that are typically gray-green on the upper surface and hairy on the underside.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer catalpifolium subsp.</p>
<p>xinganense has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-7 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>It produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and have a simple structure with five petals. The fruit is a samara with a papery wing, dispersing by wind after ripening in late summer.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer catalpifolium subsp.</p>
<p>xinganense is a rare species native to the northeastern part of China, particularly in the Xing'an Mountains. Its current distribution is limited to specific regions in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, cool environments such as mountain forests and stream valleys. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer catalpifolium subsp.</p>
<p>xinganense is a rare and ornamental tree native to China, known for its striking foliage and ecological value. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The tree grows slowly, reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in temperate climates with a distinct seasonal growth cycle.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal to prevent overgrowth, while pruning is best done in early spring to shape the tree and remove diseased branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be susceptible to aphids and powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant shrubs can enhance its growth and provide ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer catalpifolium subsp.</p>
<p>xinganense is a native tree species that provides essential food and shelter for various wildlife species in its ecosystem. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil and prevents runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, helping to mitigate climate change impacts in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer catalpifolium subsp.</p>
<p>xinganense is a lesser-known maple species native to northern China, primarily found in forested regions of Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been traditionally used in Chinese medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The wood of this species is relatively hard and durable, making it suitable for small-scale woodworking and artisanal crafts, contributing to local economies. It also holds cultural significance in certain regions, where it is occasionally planted as a ornamental tree or symbol of resilience.</p>
<p>However, due to its limited distribution and low commercial value, its role in industrial applications remains minimal.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer catalpifolium subsp.</p>
<p>xinganense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities. Popular cultivars include 'Coral Beauty' and 'Dawn Red,' which are known for their striking red foliage and unique leaf patterns.</p>
<p>This species has also been used in hybridization with other maple species to create new cultivars with enhanced traits such as improved cold hardiness and vibrant fall color. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a range of climates and its aesthetic appeal in both landscape and garden settings.</p>
<p>As a result, it remains a popular choice among horticulturists and gardeners seeking unique and resilient maple plants.</p>
