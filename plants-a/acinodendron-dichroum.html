                <h1>Acinodendron dichroum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron dichroum, commonly known as the African silver bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, white flowers and elliptical, waxy leaves. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its fruit, which is small and yellow, contains seeds that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Acinodendron dichroum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in local habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron dichroum has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface, and a lighter green underside; they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron dichroum is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these dense forest ecosystems. The plant is commonly found in lowland and hill forest regions, often growing along stream banks and in the undergrowth. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats where it can receive adequate moisture and dappled sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its natural range has become increasingly restricted in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron dichroum was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the late 19th century by European settlers who were interested in cultivating exotic plant species. Despite its aesthetic appeal, the plant has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native flora and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid spread has led to increased management efforts to control its population.</p>
<p>However, it remains a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add visual interest to their landscapes.</p>
