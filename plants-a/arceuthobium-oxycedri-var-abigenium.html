                    <h1>Arceuthobium oxycedri var. abigenium</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium oxycedri var. abigenium, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host, typically the juniper tree.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients and water through its stem-like structures that penetrate the host's tissues. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the reproductive cycle of its host, making it an important component of certain woodland habitats.</p>
