                <h1>Acianthera enianthera</h1>
<p>Acianthera enianthera, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and is often found in humid, tropical environments. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees or other plants.</p>
<p>Acianthera enianthera is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera enianthera has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, featuring white petals with a faint pinkish tinge, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera enianthera is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the states of Esp√≠rito Santo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical rainforests. The plant is adapted to the warm and moist climate of this biome.</p>
<p>It is an endemic species, meaning it is found nowhere else in the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera enianthera was mainly introduced to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil, where it has been documented in the Atlantic Forest biome.</p>
<p>This orchid is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky outcrops. It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, which are characteristic of its native habitat. The plant is often associated with secondary growth forests and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, its distribution remains relatively localized despite being an introduced species in some regions.</p>
