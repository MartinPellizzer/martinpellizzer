                        <h1>Acacia alba</h1>
<p>Acacia alba, commonly known as the white acacia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like tree that typically grows to a height of 2â€“5 meters. The plant is characterized by its slender, pale-green stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense, globular inflorescences, which appear during the dry season.</p>
<p>Acacia alba is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in traditional medicine for its various therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia alba is primarily native to the Arabian Peninsula, including countries such as Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Oman.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in sandy soils and along coastal areas. This plant thrives in hot, dry climates and is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. It is often seen in coastal dunes and rocky terrains where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes.</p>
<p>Acacia alba is also occasionally found in parts of the Horn of Africa, extending its native range slightly beyond the Arabian Peninsula.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia alba was mainly introduced to regions where it was cultivated for its ornamental value and for its ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It has been introduced to parts of Australia, the United States, and several Mediterranean countries. The plant is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive foliage. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
