<p>Arthrosolen sphaerocephalus, commonly known as the globe-headed liverwort, is a small, terrestrial moss-like plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a simple morphology with leaf-like structures that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. Its reproductive structures, called gametophores, are short and often clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Arthrosolen sphaerocephalus is an important component of microhabitats, contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small invertebrates.</p>
