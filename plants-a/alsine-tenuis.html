                    <h1>Alsine tenuis</h1>
<p>Alsine tenuis, commonly known as slender sandgrass, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats or tufts, with slender, hairless stems that often lie close to the ground. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Small, inconspicuous flowers appear in clusters, and the plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>It is often found in sandy soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
