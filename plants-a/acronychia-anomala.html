                <h1>Acronychia anomala</h1>
<p>Acronychia anomala, commonly known as the rough-leaved acronychia, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture on its trunk and branches. The leaves are typically elliptical, with a leathery texture and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain single seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in coastal and near-coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia anomala has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and smooth, with a greyish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the dry season, relying on insect pollination for reproduction. The fruit is a small, round drupe that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia anomala is primarily native to northern Queensland and eastern New South Wales in Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland rainforest areas. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in dense understorey vegetation. It is well adapted to the humid and subtropical climate of its native region.</p>
<p>Acronychia anomala is often found in the lower layers of the forest, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia anomala was mainly introduced to urban and coastal areas due to its adaptability to disturbed soils and tolerance to salt spray.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in landscaped gardens and along roadsides in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions have contributed to its spread in non-native habitats. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in regions where it has established itself.</p>
