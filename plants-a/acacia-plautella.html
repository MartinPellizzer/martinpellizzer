                    <h1>Acacia plautella</h1>
<p>Acacia plautella, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular inflorescences, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind.</p>
<p>Acacia plautella is well-suited to coastal environments due to its tolerance of salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
