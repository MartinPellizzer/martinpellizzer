                <h1>Acosta monticola</h1>
<p>Acosta monticola, commonly known as the mountain acosta, is a species of flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Acosta monticola is adapted to cold, rocky environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta monticola has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta monticola is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, including countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is typically found in high-altitude environments, often in cloud forests or grasslands at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. This plant is well adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its native habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing on slopes or in open areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, its distribution is relatively limited to these particular regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta monticola was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the late 19th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. Although it is not considered invasive, it has become established in native habitats, particularly in coastal and subalpine areas. The plant's distribution is largely limited to the northern and central regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems, though it remains a relatively minor component of the flora.</p>
