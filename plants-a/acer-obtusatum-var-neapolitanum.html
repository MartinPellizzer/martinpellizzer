                <h1>Acer obtusatum var. neapolitanum</h1>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. neapolitanum, commonly known as the Naples maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features palmately compound leaves with three to five lobes, typically turning vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its compact size and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. neapolitanum has palmate leaves that are ovate to cordate in shape, with a wavy margin, arranged alternately along the stems, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, displaying a vibrant green on the upper surface and a lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and the plant exhibits an upright growth pattern with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, clustered in corymbs, with yellowish-green petals and sepals, blooming in early spring, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the plant produces small, oval seeds enclosed within a dry, winged fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. neapolitanum is a rare maple variety native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy, particularly in the Apennine Mountains.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in specific locations within its native range, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and environmental changes. This plant thrives in temperate forest environments, often growing in shaded, moist areas with well-drained soil. It is typically found at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from human activity, it is considered a vulnerable species and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. neapolitanum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or evergreens can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. neapolitanum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by supporting a variety of insects and contributing to the overall health of the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. neapolitanum is a rare ornamental maple species primarily valued for its unique foliage and aesthetic appeal in horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>While it is not traditionally used in culinary applications, its leaves may be used in some local herbal teas in specific regions. In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for its potential anti-inflammatory properties, though research is limited. Industrially, it contributes to the ornamental plant trade, supporting local economies through cultivation and sale.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty in regions where it is cultivated, often featured in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum var. neapolitanum has several popular cultivars, including 'Sutherlandii' and 'Atrovirens', which are prized for their vibrant autumn color and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also involved in the creation of hybrids such as the 'Crimson King' maple, which combines the ornamental features of various Acer species. These cultivars and hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to different garden conditions. Their use in landscaping and urban forestry highlights their significance in modern plant collections.</p>
<p>Due to their unique foliage and resilience, they remain important in both public and private gardens.</p>
