<p>Aplectrum viminale, commonly known as the slender pogonia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy pink or purple flower with a distinctive hooded labellum. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
