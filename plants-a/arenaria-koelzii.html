<p>Arenaria koelzii, commonly known as the Koelz's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of tiny, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapting to the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
