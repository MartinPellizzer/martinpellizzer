<p>Antilla bahorucensis, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Antilla bahorucensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
