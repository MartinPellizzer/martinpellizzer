<p>Actinocephalus trichopeplus, commonly known as the mountain hakea, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, woody structure and needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. It is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a notable species in Australian flora.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus trichopeplus has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture that is typically grayish-brown in color, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern.
