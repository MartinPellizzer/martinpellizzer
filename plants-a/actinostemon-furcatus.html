                <h1>Actinostemon furcatus</h1>
<p>Actinostemon furcatus, commonly known as the forked actinostemon, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Commelinaceae, which includes plants such as spiderworts and dayflowers. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of small, brightly colored flowers arranged in a panicle-like structure. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>Actinostemon furcatus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemon furcatus has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, exhibiting a dark green color with a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and exhibits an upright growth pattern with a branching habit. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon furcatus is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with pine flatwood and cypress swamp habitats. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon furcatus was mainly introduced to new habitats in regions with moist, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along streambanks where it can thrive in the presence of consistent moisture. This plant has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia, where it has established itself in natural and semi-natural ecosystems. Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as land clearing and gardening.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains under study due to limited data on its ecological impact.</p>
