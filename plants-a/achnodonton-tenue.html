<p>Achnodonton tenue, commonly known as the slender leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale green in color. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of specific host species, making it an ecologically significant but elusive organism.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
