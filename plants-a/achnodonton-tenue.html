                <h1>Achnodonton tenue</h1>
<p>Achnodonton tenue, commonly known as the slender leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale green in color. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of specific host species, making it an ecologically significant but elusive organism.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnodonton tenue has slender, erect stems that are woody and covered with a rough, greyish bark.</p>
<p>Its leaves are narrow, linear, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a pointed tip. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are pale yellow, with four petals and a tubular structure, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnodonton tenue is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. This species thrives in coastal and mountainous regions with well-drained soils. It is often associated with fynbos vegetation, which is characteristic of the region's unique biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the area, with dry summers and wet winters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnodonton tenue was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides and urban environments. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems varies depending on the local environment and management practices.</p>
