<p>Alnus glutinosa subsp.</p>
<p>glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky alder, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a sticky resinous substance.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in catkins, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
