<p>Alyssum petraeum, commonly known as the rock alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has compact, mat-forming foliage with silvery-gray leaves that help it thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Alyssum petraeum is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and coastal gardens.</p>
