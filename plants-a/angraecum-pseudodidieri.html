                    <h1>Angraecum pseudodidieri</h1>
<p>Angraecum pseudodidieri, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and pollination strategy make it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in conservation programs.</p>
