                    <h1>Acrocephalus indicus var. spicatus</h1>
<p>Acrocephalus indicus var. spicatus, commonly known as the spiculate marsh warbler, is a variant of the marsh warbler native to wetland habitats in South and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, insectivorous bird with a distinctive, slender body and a long, pointed bill adapted for foraging in dense vegetation. The plant's botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in marshy areas, often near water bodies, and is closely associated with wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered an indicator species for the health of wetland environments.</p>
