                <h1>Aconitum longilobum</h1>
<p>Aconitum longilobum, commonly known as the long-lobed monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive hooded flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant features palmately divided, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Aconitum longilobum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum longilobum has large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, bluish-green bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple, spathaceous structures that bloom in late summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving in cold climates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum longilobum is primarily native to Tibet.</p>
<p>It is found in the high-altitude regions of this region, where it thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. This plant is commonly associated with rocky soils and meadows in mountainous areas. It is part of the buttercup family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its remote habitat, it is not widely distributed beyond Tibet.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum longilobum was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly during the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It was often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue or purple flowers. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become an invasive species in several regions, outcompeting native flora. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, as it can dominate wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and protect local biodiversity.</p>
