                    <h1>Atriplex odorata</h1>
<p>Atriplex odorata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its salt tolerance makes it an important pioneer species in saline soils.</p>
<p>Atriplex odorata also has a long history of use by indigenous peoples for food, medicine, and basket-making.</p>
