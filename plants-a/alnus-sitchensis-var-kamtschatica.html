                    <h1>Alnus sitchensis var. kamtschatica</h1>
<p>Alnus sitchensis var. kamtschatica, commonly known as the Kamchatka alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, aggregate fruits that disperse via wind. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and wetlands. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen, enriching the soil for other plant species.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh climates makes it a resilient component of boreal and temperate ecosystems.</p>
