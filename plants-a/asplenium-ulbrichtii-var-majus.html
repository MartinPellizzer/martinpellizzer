                    <h1>Asplenium ulbrichtii var. majus</h1>
<p>Asplenium ulbrichtii var. majus, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a rare and striking fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical collections and conservation efforts.</p>
