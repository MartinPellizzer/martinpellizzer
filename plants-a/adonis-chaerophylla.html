                <h1>Adonis chaerophylla</h1>
<p>Adonis chaerophylla, commonly known as the alpine adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided lobes, and it has a short, stout stem.</p>
<p>Adonis chaerophylla is often found in high-altitude environments, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis chaerophylla has small, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are yellow, cup-shaped, and have five petals, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis chaerophylla is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and gravelly soils, often in mountainous or coastal areas. This plant thrives in temperate climates with mild winters and hot, dry summers. It is particularly associated with the Iberian Peninsula, Italy, and the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats where it can receive adequate sunlight and drainage.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis chaerophylla was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in regions with dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas such as California, Nevada, and Utah, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. This plant is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes due to its attractive yellow flowers and low maintenance requirements. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
