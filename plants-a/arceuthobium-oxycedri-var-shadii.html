                    <h1>Arceuthobium oxycedri var. shadii</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium oxycedri var. shadii, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish stems and lack of leaves. This species typically attaches to the roots of juniper trees, such as Juniperus oxycedrus, through specialized structures called haustoria. It reproduces via seeds that are dispersed by wind or animals, and its life cycle is closely tied to the health of its host plant.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the growth and survival of its host.</p>
