<p>Arctium aureum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring lobed leaves and a rough, hairy stem. The plant produces spiky, purple-brown bur-like fruits that contain seeds with hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, clustered in umbrella-like heads, and it thrives in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
