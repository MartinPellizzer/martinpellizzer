<p>Astrotrichilia procera, commonly known as the giant candle plant, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its tall, candle-like stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The showy yellow flowers appear in clusters at the top of the plant, attracting pollinators and adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
