                    <h1>Arenaria pycnophylloides var. compacta</h1>
<p>Arenaria pycnophylloides var. compacta, commonly known as the dense-leaved sandpink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are densely packed, giving it a cushion-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of pink to rose-colored flowers in late spring, adding ornamental value to its habitat. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to poor soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
