<p>Avena ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous oat, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces both male and female flowers, which contribute to its common name and make it unique among oat species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it blend into its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Avena ambigua is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
