<p>Atriplex argentea subsp.</p>
<p>expansa, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix soil nutrients, it is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
