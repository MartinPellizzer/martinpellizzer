                <h1>Aechmea flexuosa</h1>
<p>Aechmea flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers, followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aechmea flexuosa is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea flexuosa has leaves that are broad, strap-like, and often recurved, arranged in a rosette formation, with a dark green to bluish-gray color and a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, instead having a short, stout base with a fibrous, rough-textured bark that is typically greenish-brown in color. Its inflorescence is a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, with small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the late summer to early autumn months and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its natural habitat, often in rocky or wooded areas.</p>
