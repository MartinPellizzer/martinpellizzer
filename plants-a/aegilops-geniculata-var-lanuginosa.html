                    <h1>Aegilops geniculata var. lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Aegilops geniculata var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly wild barley, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, glabrous leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic contributions to cultivated barley.</p>
