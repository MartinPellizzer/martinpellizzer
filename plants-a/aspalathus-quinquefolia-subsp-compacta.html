<p>Aspalathus quinquefolia subsp.</p>
<p>compacta, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, opposite leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, oval-shaped seeds. It is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate, with a dormant period during the wet season.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to the more well-known Aspalathus linearis, from which traditional rooibos tea is derived.</p>
