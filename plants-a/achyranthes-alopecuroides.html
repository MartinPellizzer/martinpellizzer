                <h1>Achyranthes alopecuroides</h1>
<p>Achyranthes alopecuroides, commonly known as Indian spinach or bhang, is a herbaceous plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Achyranthes alopecuroides thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes alopecuroides has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually 3–8 cm long and 1–3 cm wide, with a rough, hairy surface and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, often branching, with a rough, ridged texture and a reddish-brown bark. The flowers are small, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, with greenish-white petals and stamen, blooming in summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, aiding in soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes alopecuroides is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, including countries such as India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in moist, shady areas of forests and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is known for its erect growth habit and small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes alopecuroides was mainly introduced to agricultural areas and disturbed soils in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in fields, roadsides, and wastelands where it thrives in poor soil conditions. The plant is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes. Its introduction has led to competition with native species, affecting local ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is widely distributed in parts of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
