<p>Anil humifusa, commonly known as the creeping marshweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features spreading, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats in moist soils. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Anil humifusa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
