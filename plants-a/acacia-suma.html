                    <h1>Acacia suma</h1>
<p>Acacia suma, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves that are composed of numerous small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia suma is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and charcoal.</p>
