                <h1>Acacia suma</h1>
<p>Acacia suma, commonly known as the Indian acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and compound leaves that are often feather-like in appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its seed pods are woody and contain small, flat seeds.</p>
<p>Acacia suma is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological significance in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia suma has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, feather-like leaflets arranged in a dense, fern-like pattern, typically measuring about 10-20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is dark grey to brown in color. The flowers are yellow and arranged in dense, globular inflorescences, blooming from December to March, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a flat, woody pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their small size and light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to access water and nutrients from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia suma is a shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has expanded to include parts of India, Africa, and even the Caribbean due to human introduction. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in dry, open areas such as savannas and coastal regions. Acacia suma typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is threatened by deforestation and land conversion, leading to concerns about its long-term conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia suma is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions, commonly grown for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a warm, moist environment to germinate, while cuttings root easily in well-draining soil. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in full sun with minimal water once established. It benefits from light fertilization during the growing season and occasional pruning to maintain shape and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>While generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may attract aphids or scale insects, and companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia suma is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich flowers. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting other plant growth. Its deep roots also help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acacia suma serves as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of nearby vegetation in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acacia suma is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, its leaves are used in traditional dishes, while its flowers are sometimes consumed as a spice. Medicinally, it has been used in traditional medicine to treat ailments such as inflammation and digestive issues.
