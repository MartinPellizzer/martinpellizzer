                <h1>Achlydosa glandulosa</h1>
<p>Achlydosa glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky leaf mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and glandular leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name and aid in water retention.</p>
<p>Achlydosa glandulosa is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achlydosa glandulosa has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and covered with fine, sticky glands, while the bark is smooth and pale greenish-white. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achlydosa glandulosa is primarily native to New Caledonia.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly associated with limestone substrates and is often found in the understorey of dense vegetation. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within the region.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its habitat from degradation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achlydosa glandulosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. The plant spreads through its fibrous root system and can form dense mats, often outcompeting native vegetation. It is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
