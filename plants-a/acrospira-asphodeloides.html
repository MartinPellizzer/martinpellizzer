<p>Acrospira asphodeloides, commonly known as the desert lily, is a striking perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, erect stems with showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink or purple. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources. Its flowers bloom during the rainy season, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Acrospira asphodeloides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
