                    <h1>Alnus oblongifolia</h1>
<p>Alnus oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf alder, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Alnus oblongifolia is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, enriching the soil for other plant species.</p>
