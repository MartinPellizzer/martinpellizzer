                    <h1>Acroptilon</h1>
<p>Acroptilon, commonly known as the goatweed, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their slender, erect stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer. They are native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and are often found in meadows and along roadsides. Acroptilon species are perennial herbs that can spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making them somewhat invasive in certain areas.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them interesting subjects for ecological and horticultural study.</p>
