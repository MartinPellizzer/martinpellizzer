                <h1>Acer nipponicum subsp. orientale</h1>
<p>Acer nipponicum subsp.</p>
<p>orientale, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its ornamental value, particularly its vibrant autumn foliage that ranges from red to orange.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 6–12 meters, with a rounded crown and palmate leaves that are usually 5–10 centimeters in length. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited for cultivation in gardens and is valued for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer nipponicum subsp.</p>
<p>orientale has palmately compound leaves that are ovate to cordate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size of about 5-10 cm in length, and display a vibrant green on the upper surface with a lighter underside. The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in cymes, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer nipponicum subsp.</p>
<p>orientale is a species of maple native to eastern Asia, specifically Japan and parts of Korea. While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to specific regions in Japan, particularly in the southern and central areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate forest environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soils under canopy cover. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered a vulnerable species and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer nipponicum subsp.</p>
<p>orientale is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and elegant form. It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for successful germination.</p>
<p>The growth cycle includes rapid growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy during winter. It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with companion plants like hostas or ferns.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
