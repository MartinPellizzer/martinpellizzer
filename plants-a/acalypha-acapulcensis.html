<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some freshwater algae, characterized by their complex structures and ability to perform photosynthesis. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and some modern flowering plants. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is characterized by their floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many species with specialized adaptations for various environments. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes a wide variety of plants with diverse morphologies and some containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupweed," characterized by their often hairy leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha acapulcensis, a specific plant within the Acalypha genus found in certain regions, known for its unique morphological features and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha acapulcensis is primarily native to Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of this area, particularly in the states of Oaxaca and Puebla. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the cloud forests. It is commonly found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
