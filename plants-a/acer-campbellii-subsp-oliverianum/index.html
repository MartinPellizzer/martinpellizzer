                            <h1>Acer Campbellii Subsp. Oliverianum</h1>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp. oliverianum is a rare and striking member of the maple family known for its vibrant autumn foliage. Native to the mountainous regions of western China, this subspecies thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its unique leaves, often with a deep red or orange hue, make it a prized addition to botanical gardens and specialized collections. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively obscure compared to more common maple varieties. Cultivating this plant requires careful attention to its specific environmental needs.</p>
