                    <h1>Antennaria margaritacea</h1>
<p>Antennaria margaritacea, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Antennaria margaritacea is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
