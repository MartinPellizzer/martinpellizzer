                <h1>Aechmea marmorata</h1>
<p>Aechmea marmorata, commonly known as the Marble Aechmea, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water. The leaves are typically gray-green with white or silver markings, giving it a striking appearance. It produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea marmorata has leaves that are broad, strap-shaped, and arranged in a rosette formation, with a waxy, dark green surface and a striking silver or white stripe running along the midrib.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, instead having a short, compact growth pattern with a thick, fleshy base that resembles a pseudostem. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of bright red flowers with yellowish tepals, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air, typical of its bromeliad family.</p>
