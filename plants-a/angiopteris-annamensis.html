<p>Angiopteris annamensis, commonly known as the Annam fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Angiopteridaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique trait makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
