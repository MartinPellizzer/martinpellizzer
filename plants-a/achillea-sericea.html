                <h1>Achillea sericea</h1>
<p>Achillea sericea, commonly known as silver yarrow, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and western Asia and is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Silver yarrow is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sericea has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a silvery-gray underside due to fine hairs, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with fine, soft hairs, and is typically greenish-gray in color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to the feathery appendage.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sericea is primarily native to temperate regions of Europe, particularly the Mediterranean area, including southern France, Italy, and Spain.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of North Africa and the Middle East. This plant thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes, gravelly soils, and open woodlands. It is commonly associated with Mediterranean climates and is often found in areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into some parts of western Asia, including Turkey and the Caucasus region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sericea was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste grounds.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common invasive species in many regions. The plant was likely introduced through human activity, including gardening and landscaping. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds contribute to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas due to its competitive nature.</p>
