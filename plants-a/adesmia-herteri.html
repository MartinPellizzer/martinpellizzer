                <h1>Adesmia herteri</h1>
<p>Adesmia herteri, commonly known as the yellow bignay, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Leguminosae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are often used in local cuisine. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Adesmia herteri is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia herteri has small, ovate leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2-3 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia herteri is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands. This plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range, including low rainfall and intense sunlight. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local fauna.</p>
<p>Due to its specific environmental requirements, Adesmia herteri is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia herteri was mainly introduced to areas with suitable climate conditions, including regions with moderate temperatures and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, pastures, and open woodlands. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often spread through seed dispersal by wind or animals. Due to its adaptability, it has been reported in several states across the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
