                    <h1>Aphanes parodii</h1>
<p>Aphanes parodii, commonly known as the Parodi's sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to sandy and gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or dry grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Aphanes parodii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
