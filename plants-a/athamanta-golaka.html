                    <h1>Athamanta golaka</h1>
<p>Athamanta golaka, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers, which resemble flames, and its delicate, strap-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the trunks of trees or in rocky crevices. Its flowers bloom in late summer and are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Athamanta golaka is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
