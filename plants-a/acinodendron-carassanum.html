                <h1>Acinodendron carassanum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron carassanum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its aromatic wood and evergreen foliage. The plant has small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a capsule containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and high demand for its valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron carassanum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slightly fibrous texture and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron carassanum is a small, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has expanded slightly due to horticultural interest, though it remains primarily in its native range. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within lowland and hill forests. This species typically grows at altitudes between 300 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, Acinodendron carassanum is considered to be of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acinodendron carassanum is a hardy shrub commonly cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter method offering faster and more reliable results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within two to three years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acinodendron carassanum is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for its reproduction and the health of the surrounding flora. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other vegetation in its vicinity. Additionally, it plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its root system.</p>
<p>Its presence also enhances soil fertility by acting as a nitrogen fixer, benefiting the overall ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acinodendron carassanum is a plant with limited documented uses, primarily found in specific regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is occasionally used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties, though scientific validation remains scarce. There are no well-established culinary applications for this plant. Its role in cultural or symbolic contexts is not widely recognized in global traditions.</p>
<p>Due to a lack of comprehensive research, its industrial or economic significance remains largely unexplored.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acinodendron carassanum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegatum' and 'Compactum', which are appreciated for their unique foliage patterns and compact growth habit. Hybrids of Acinodendron carassanum are often developed to enhance traits such as color, size, and disease resistance. These plants hold horticultural importance due to their adaptability to various garden settings and their ability to thrive in both indoor and outdoor environments.</p>
<p>Their aesthetic appeal makes them a popular choice for landscaping and container gardening.</p>
