                <h1>Achillea phrygia</h1>
<p>Achillea phrygia, commonly known as the Turkish yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a robust root system and a bushy growth habit. The plant features finely divided, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and useful in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea phrygia has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and has a greenish hue with a slightly rough texture, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk florets surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and pappus structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea phrygia is primarily native to Turkey.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the central and eastern regions of the country. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in open habitats. It is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Its native range in Turkey reflects its adaptation to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea phrygia was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste grounds, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in regions with low rainfall. The plant is considered an invasive species in some parts of the world due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has been reported in several European countries and is spreading to new regions through human activity.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
