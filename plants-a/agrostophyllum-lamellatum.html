                    <h1>Agrostophyllum lamellatum</h1>
<p>Agrostophyllum lamellatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as eucalypts, and derives some of its nutrients from the host. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
<p>However, it can also cause stress to its host plants if it becomes too abundant.</p>
