                    <h1>Achyronia cephalotes</h1>
<p>Achyronia cephalotes, commonly known as the scarlet tiger moth, is a species of moth belonging to the family Erebidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red, orange, and black wing patterns, which serve as a warning signal to potential predators. The plant it is associated with is not a plant but an insect, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. Therefore, the query is based on a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
