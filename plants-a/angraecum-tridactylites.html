                    <h1>Angraecum tridactylites</h1>
<p>Angraecum tridactylites, commonly known as the three-fingered orchid, is a species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed structure, which gives it its common name. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Angraecum tridactylites is also noted for its fragrant blooms, which attract nocturnal pollinators like moths.</p>
