                    <h1>Athyrium filix-femina var. fissidens</h1>
<p>Athyrium filix-femina var. fissidens, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a variant of the lady fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply divided fronds with a golden hue on the underside, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>The varietal name "fissidens" refers to the split or fissured appearance of its fronds, a key botanical feature.</p>
