<p>Abacopteris gymnopteridifrons var. bipinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fern, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific microhabitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which includes many epiphytic and lithophytic ferns. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatifid leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
