                        <h1>Abacopteris gymnopteridifrons var. bipinnatifida</h1>
<p>Abacopteris gymnopteridifrons var. bipinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fern, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific microhabitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which includes many epiphytic and lithophytic ferns. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatifid leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abacopteris gymnopteridifrons var. bipinnatifida belongs to the kingdom Plantae, phylum Angiospermae, class Magnoliopsida, subclass Magnoliidae, order Sapindales, family Sapindaceae, genus Abacopteris, and species gymnopteridifrons, with the variety bipinnatifida.</p>
<p>This classification places it within the flowering plants, specifically in the order Sapindales, which includes a variety of economically important trees and shrubs. The genus Abacopteris is part of the family Sapindaceae, known for its diverse species found in tropical and subtropical regions. The variety bipinnatifida is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology, characterized by a bipinnate structure.</p>
<p>This taxonomical classification helps in understanding its evolutionary relationships and ecological significance.</p>
