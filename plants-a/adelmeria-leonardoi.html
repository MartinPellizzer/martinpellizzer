                <h1>Adelmeria leonardoi</h1>
<p>Adelmeria leonardoi, commonly known as Leonard's holly, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the coastal areas of California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red berries that are edible but typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a unique addition to coastal gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelmeria leonardoi has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stems are woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and they grow in a spreading, shrub-like pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky soils and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelmeria leonardoi is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the island of Luzon. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and undergrowth. The plant is well adapted to the humid and warm climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>It is a rare and endemic species, contributing to the rich biodiversity of the Philippines.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelmeria leonardoi was mainly introduced to coastal and rocky habitats in California, particularly in the northern and central regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing on cliffs or slopes. This plant is commonly found in areas with mild, Mediterranean climates and is often associated with other native coastal flora. Its introduction has been linked to both natural dispersal and human activity, including horticultural use.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become established in several ecological communities along the Pacific coast.</p>
