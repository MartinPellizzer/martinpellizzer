                <h1>Adicea repens</h1>
<p>Adicea repens, commonly known as creeping adicea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its spreading habit and hairy stems. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are small, tubular, and typically pink or violet, arranged in dense clusters.</p>
<p>Adicea repens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea repens has creeping stems that are typically green or slightly reddish, with a smooth texture and a growth pattern that spreads along the ground.</p>
<p>Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stems, and are usually green with a slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small, white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to spread and colonize disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea repens is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments like forest understories and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and is often associated with lowland rainforests. It is also present in parts of Madagascar and the Indian Ocean islands.</p>
<p>Adicea repens is known for its creeping growth habit and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea repens was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and accidental dispersal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, fields, and gardens. This plant has a tendency to spread rapidly due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to reproduce through rhizomes. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major threat in all areas where it has been introduced.</p>
