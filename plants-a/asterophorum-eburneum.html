                    <h1>Asterophorum eburneum</h1>
<p>Asterophorum eburneum, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on decaying wood in moist, shaded environments, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are predominantly white with faint greenish veins, and it blooms in late summer to early fall.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its specific ecological requirements, Asterophorum eburneum is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
