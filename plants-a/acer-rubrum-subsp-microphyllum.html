                <h1>Acer rubrum subsp. microphyllum</h1>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>microphyllum, commonly known as the red maple with small leaves, is a variant of the red maple tree native to eastern North America. It is distinguished by its smaller, more elliptical leaves compared to the typical red maple.</p>
<p>The plant produces red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves turn vibrant red in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>microphyllum has small, ovate to elliptical leaves that are alternate in arrangement, typically measuring up to 5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stems are slender, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and the growth pattern is primarily upright with a rounded crown.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, before the leaves emerge, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>microphyllum is a variant of the red maple that is native to the southeastern United States, primarily found in states such as Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of Europe and Asia, where it is cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils in riparian zones, floodplains, and wetlands, often near rivers and streams. It typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level to approximately 150 meters.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is not considered endangered, though its limited native range makes it somewhat rare in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>microphyllum is a distinctive maple species known for its ornamental value and adaptability. It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>The growth cycle involves a slow initial development, followed by rapid growth in favorable conditions, typically reaching maturity within 10â€“15 years. It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with flowering shrubs and perennials for aesthetic and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>microphyllum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil health. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land during heavy rainfall.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving air quality and offering habitat for a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>microphyllum is a lesser-known variant of the red maple tree, primarily valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for wildlife. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its sap can be tapped and processed similarly to other maple species, though it is less common.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, the bark and leaves have been used by Indigenous peoples for their potential anti-inflammatory and astringent properties. Industrially, it contributes to the timber industry, offering durable wood for construction and furniture.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is a symbol of resilience and adaptability, often featured in local landscapes and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>microphyllum has several popular cultivars such as 'Autumn Flame' and 'Crimson King', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habit. It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, leading to varieties like the 'Emerald Queen' and 'Red Sunset' maples, which exhibit enhanced ornamental traits.</p>
<p>These hybrids often display improved cold hardiness and extended seasonal color. Horticulturally, Acer rubrum subsp. microphyllum is valued for its adaptability to a range of soil conditions and its ability to thrive in both urban and suburban landscapes.</p>
<p>Its aesthetic appeal makes it a popular choice for landscape design and ornamental gardening.</p>
