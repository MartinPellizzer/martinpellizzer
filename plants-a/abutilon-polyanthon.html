                        <h1>Abutilon polyanthon</h1>
<p>Abutilon polyanthon, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>

<p>The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or disturbed areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon polyanthon is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed areas like roadsides and open forests. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often associated with lowland and coastal habitats. It is also occasionally found in parts of southern China and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across various islands in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon polyanthon was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
