<p>Atriplex verrucifera, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Atriplex verrucifera is often found in sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, saline conditions.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
