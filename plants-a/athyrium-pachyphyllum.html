<p>Athyrium pachyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leafed lady fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, which help it store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
