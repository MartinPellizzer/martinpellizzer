                    <h1>Artemisia albida</h1>
<p>Artemisia albida, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Artemisia albida is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>It also has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds.</p>
