                <h1>Achras obovata</h1>
<p>Achras obovata, commonly known as the African dune tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized evergreen tree with thick, waxy leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruits are large, spiny capsules that contain seeds, and the plant is adapted to arid and coastal environments.</p>
<p>Achras obovata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras obovata has leaves that are obovate in shape, with a broad base and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem, and they are typically dark green in color, with a smooth surface and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, bark that is brown in color and has a fissured texture, growing upright with a single trunk. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are extensive and fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and absorbing nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras obovata is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in parts of Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>While its native range is relatively limited, it has been introduced to other tropical and subtropical regions around the world. It thrives in coastal areas, often growing in sandy soils near the shoreline. This species typically occurs at low altitudes, usually below 100 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is listed as a species of concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution, though its conservation status remains largely unstudied.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras obovata is a slow-growing, evergreen shrub native to Madagascar, known for its striking yellow flowers and edible fruit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being the more reliable method for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a long growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity and produce fruit.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant and encourage fruiting are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract scale insects or mealybugs, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like rosemary or thyme can help deter pests and enhance the garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras obovata is a valuable plant species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its large, sweet fruits attract birds, bats, and small mammals, which help in seed dispersal. The plant also acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing biodiversity and soil health. Additionally, its deep root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in degraded areas.</p>
<p>Overall, Achras obovata plays a crucial ecological role in supporting local ecosystems and promoting environmental resilience.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achras obovata is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications.</p>
<p>Its fruit, known as the "coco de mer," is valued in culinary contexts for its unique flavor and texture. In traditional medicine, it has been used to treat various ailments, including digestive issues and skin conditions. Industrially, the plant contributes to local economies through the production of oils and other by-products.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some regions, representing longevity and prosperity.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achras obovata has several popular cultivars, including 'Achras obovata 'Variegata' and 'Achras obovata 'Compacta', which are valued for their ornamental features such as variegated foliage and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>While natural hybrids of Achras obovata are relatively rare, horticulturists have developed various cultivars through selective breeding to enhance traits like cold hardiness and flowering performance. These cultivars are often used in tropical and subtropical gardens for their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in warm climates. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its role as a decorative species, particularly in landscaping and as a specimen plant.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and visual interest make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add unique textures and colors to their collections.</p>
