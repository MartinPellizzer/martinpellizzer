                <h1>Achras obovata</h1>
<p>Achras obovata, commonly known as the African silver cluster tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, palmate leaves that are obovate in shape. The tree produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that are edible for some animals. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras obovata has broad, obovate-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in panicles, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spherical, spiky capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras obovata is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in rocky or sandy soils. This plant is commonly associated with savanna and thicket vegetation types. It is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in regions with similar environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras obovata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential economic uses.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm climates, including parts of South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. Its introduction has sometimes led to concerns about its invasive potential in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is generally regarded as a manageable and valuable addition to horticultural collections.</p>
