<p>Arachniodes gijiangensis, commonly known as the Gijiang bamboo-ferns, is a rare fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble spider webs, hence its genus name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
