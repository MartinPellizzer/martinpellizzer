                    <h1>Achyropsis robynsii</h1>
<p>Achyropsis robynsii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its succulent leaves help it store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Achyropsis robynsii plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
