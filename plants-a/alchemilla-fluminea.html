<p>Alchemilla fluminea, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often forming dense mats near the water's edge. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Alchemilla fluminea is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
