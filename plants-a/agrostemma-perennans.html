<p>Agrostemma perennans, commonly known as the everlasting grass or perennial grass-vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and wastelands. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by long, slender seed pods.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
