                    <h1>Anthorrhiza stevensii</h1>
<p>Anthorrhiza stevensii, commonly known as the Stevens' ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale greenish-white flowers and a single, elongated spur. This epiphytic plant grows on tree trunks or branches in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia. Its leaves are strap-like and often covered in a dense layer of white, fuzzy hair.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
