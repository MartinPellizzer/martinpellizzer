                <h1>Acacia verticillata subsp. ruscifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia verticillata subsp.</p>
<p>ruscifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that appear in compact clusters.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or loamy soils and prefers full sun. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia verticillata subsp.</p>
<p>ruscifolia has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged in a whorl of three at each node, and varying in size from 1 to 3 cm in length. The stems are upright, often branching, with a smooth, pale greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow, arranged in dense, globular clusters, and bloom during the winter months, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, which are small, black, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are typically shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils in which the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia verticillata subsp.</p>
<p>ruscifolia is a shrub native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa and Namibia. Its current distribution includes parts of the Kalahari Desert and adjacent arid regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in open grasslands and shrublands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>It is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List, indicating it is not currently at risk of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia verticillata subsp.</p>
<p>ruscifolia is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to southern Africa, known for its feathery foliage and yellow flowers. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for better germination.</p>
<p>The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil, and it requires minimal watering once established. Fertilization should be light during the growing season, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and promote flowering.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions, and it pairs well with succulents and native grasses in companion planting.</p>
