<p>Asplenium yoshinagae subsp.</p>
<p>indicum, commonly known as the Indian shield fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori and indusia, are typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
