                <h1>Aechmea andaquiensis</h1>
<p>Aechmea andaquiensis, commonly known as the Andean bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the humid cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater. The plant's foliage is often adorned with vibrant colors, ranging from green to red, depending on the variety. It produces striking inflorescences with colorful bracts that can last for several months.</p>
<p>Aechmea andaquiensis is well adapted to high-altitude environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea andaquiensis has rosette-shaped leaves that are stiff, sword-like, and arranged in a compact spiral, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, thick base covered in a fibrous, dark brown bark. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, branched spike bearing small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind or insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>
