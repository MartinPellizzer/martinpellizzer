                    <h1>Axonopus polydactylus</h1>
<p>Axonopus polydactylus, commonly known as the velvetgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lawns, gardens, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its ability to form dense mats makes it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in cultivated areas.</p>
