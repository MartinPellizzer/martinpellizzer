                        <h1>Abies lasiocarpa var. pendula</h1>
<p>Abies lasiocarpa var. pendula, commonly known as the pendant subalpine fir, is a variant of the subalpine fir native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous branches that droop downward, giving the tree a distinctive, weeping appearance. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This variety thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of mountain ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
