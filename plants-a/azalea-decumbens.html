<p>Azalea decumbens, commonly known as the creeping azalea, is a flowering shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, spreading growth habit and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Azalea decumbens is also notable for its ability to produce both male and female flowers on the same plant, a trait known as monoecious.</p>
