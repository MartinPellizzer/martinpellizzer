<p>It is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in some varieties, making it a unique and visually striking plant in its habitat.</p>
