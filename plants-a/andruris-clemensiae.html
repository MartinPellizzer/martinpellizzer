                    <h1>Andruris clemensiae</h1>
<p>Andruris clemensiae, commonly known as the Clemens' sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
