<p>Acrocomia microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf palm, is a small, slow-growing palm native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of about 3 to 5 meters and has a slender trunk covered with persistent leaf bases. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellow flowers, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are consumed by various bird species. Its leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow segments that give it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Acrocomia microcarpa is adapted to coastal and dry environments, making it a resilient species in tropical climates.</p>
