                    <h1>Agrostis borealis var. flaccida</h1>
<p>Agrostis borealis var. flaccida, commonly known as the northern bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to survive extreme seasonal variations and is an important component of polar ecosystems.</p>
