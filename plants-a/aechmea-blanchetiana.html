<p>Aechmea blanchetiana, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure that forms a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking pink or red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Aechmea blanchetiana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
