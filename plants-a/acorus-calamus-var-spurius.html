                <h1>Acorus calamus var. spurius</h1>
<p>Acorus calamus var. spurius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sweetflag, is a variant of the sweetflag plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a distinct, aromatic rhizome that is often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense clusters that help stabilize the surrounding environment. Its flowering stems rise above the foliage, producing small, spadix-like inflorescences that are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to A. calamus but differs in leaf morphology and habitat preference.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. spurius has long, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a bluish-green color and a smooth, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is narrow and upright, with a dark brown, rough-textured bark that grows monostichously. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in a spadix, which are pollinated by insects, typically blooming in early summer. The fruit is a three-lobed berry that disperses its seeds by water, as the seeds are buoyant.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense underground network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. spurius is a variant of the sweetflag plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these regions, its current distribution is limited and fragmented, with populations primarily confined to specific habitats in China. This plant thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies, often in shaded, moist environments. It is typically found at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from near sea level up to around 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered a species of concern and is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. spurius is a hardy aquatic plant commonly found in wetlands and marshy areas, known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through rhizome division or by planting rhizomes directly into moist soil. The growth cycle of this plant is perennial, with active growth during the spring and summer months, and it goes dormant in colder seasons.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it thrives in rich, loamy soil with consistent moisture, requiring regular watering but avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced aquatic fertilizer during the growing season supports healthy foliage, while pruning dead leaves in autumn helps maintain plant health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally be affected by aphids or fungal issues if water conditions are poor.</p>
<p>Companion planting with water lilies or cattails can enhance the ecological balance of wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. spurius is a wetland plant that provides food and shelter for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as insects and birds due to its unique foliage and potential nectar sources. The plant acts as a natural filter, helping to improve water quality by absorbing excess nutrients. It also serves as a companion plant in wetland restoration projects, enhancing biodiversity.</p>
<p>Additionally, its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion along water bodies.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. spurius is a lesser-known variant of the sweet flag plant, which has been historically used in various cultural and symbolic contexts, particularly in traditional medicine and spiritual practices.</p>
<p>While its culinary use is limited compared to other members of the genus, it has been occasionally employed in herbal teas and infusions. In industrial and economic applications, it has been used in the production of perfumes and as a natural dye due to its aromatic properties. Medicinally, it has been traditionally used to treat digestive issues and as a tonic for the nervous system.</p>
<p>However, its role in modern applications is largely overshadowed by more widely studied species within the same genus.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. spurius has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability in water gardens.</p>
<p>Notable cultivars include 'Aureovariegatus' and 'Variegatus', which display striking variegated foliage. Hybrids of this variety are often created to enhance leaf color and growth habits, though specific hybrid names are less commonly documented. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in wet environments, making it a valuable addition to pond margins and bog gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits, it is increasingly favored by landscape designers and gardeners.</p>
