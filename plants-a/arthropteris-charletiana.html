<p>Arthropteris charletiana, commonly known as the Charlet's water fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>Arthropteris charletiana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
