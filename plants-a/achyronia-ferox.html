                <h1>Achyronia ferox</h1>
<p>Achyronia ferox, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a toxic plant native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to about 1-2 meters in height, featuring dark green, oval-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from purple to white. The plant produces small, glossy black berries that are highly poisonous, containing tropane alkaloids such as atropine and scopolamine.</p>
<p>These compounds have been historically used in medicine and as a poison, making the plant both dangerous and historically significant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia ferox has compound leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is dark brown to black in color, and it exhibits a creeping growth pattern along the ground. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pale yellow petals and a strong, unpleasant odor, blooming in late summer and pollinated primarily by flies. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia ferox is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests. It is often associated with areas that have high biodiversity and rich soil.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the Amazon rainforest and surrounding ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia ferox was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been found in regions with warm climates and well-drained soils, often near human settlements. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. It has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local biodiversity.</p>
