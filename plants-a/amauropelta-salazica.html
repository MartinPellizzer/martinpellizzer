<p>Amauropelta salazica, commonly known as the Salazic shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant is native to the Andes Mountains in South America, where it thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>Amauropelta salazica is often found in high-altitude cloud forests, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and biodiversity.</p>
