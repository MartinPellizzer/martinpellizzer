<p>Arenaria weissiana var. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It typically features small, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
