                            <h1>Arabis Sagittata Subsp. Lusitanica</h1>
<p>Arabis sagittata subsp. lusitanica is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, known for its cruciform flowers and medicinal properties. This subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, arrow-shaped leaves and small, white blooms that appear in early spring. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
