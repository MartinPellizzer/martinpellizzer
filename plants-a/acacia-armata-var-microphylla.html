                    <h1>Acacia armata var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Acacia armata var. microphylla, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, narrow phyllodes that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which bloom in spring and attract a variety of pollinators. It is well adapted to sandy soils and saline environments, making it a hardy plant in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>The leaves are often reduced to phyllodes, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
