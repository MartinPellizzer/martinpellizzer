                <h1>Adenogramma physocalyx</h1>
<p>Adenogramma physocalyx, commonly known as the velvetleaf adenogramma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves with a velvety texture and showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Adenogramma physocalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenogramma physocalyx has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient nutrient uptake in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma physocalyx is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests and along stream banks in these regions. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the tropical regions of the Indo-Malayan biodiversity hotspot.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma physocalyx was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It has been reported as an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential threat to native vegetation.</p>
