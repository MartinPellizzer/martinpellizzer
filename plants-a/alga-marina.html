                    <h1>Alga marina</h1>
<p>Alga marina, commonly known as sea lettuce, is a type of green algae that thrives in coastal waters.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like structure and vibrant green color, which comes from its high concentration of chlorophyll. This algae plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various aquatic organisms. It reproduces through sexual reproduction, releasing motile gametes into the water.</p>
<p>Alga marina is often found in intertidal zones and can form dense mats on rocky surfaces.</p>
