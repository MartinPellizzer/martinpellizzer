                    <h1>Aerides coriacea</h1>
<p>Aerides coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, leathery leaves that are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its often humid and shaded habitat. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a unique spurred shape. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its tropical environment, making it a distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
