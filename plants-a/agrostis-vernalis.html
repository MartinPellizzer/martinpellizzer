                    <h1>Agrostis vernalis</h1>
<p>Agrostis vernalis, commonly known as spring bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue when fresh.</p>
<p>Agrostis vernalis is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock.</p>
