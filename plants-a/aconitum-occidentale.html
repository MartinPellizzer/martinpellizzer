                <h1>Aconitum occidentale</h1>
<p>Aconitum occidentale, commonly known as western aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>However, all parts of the plant are highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum occidentale has compound, bipinnately arranged leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a broad, ovate shape and a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and hollow, with a grayish-green bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are large, showy, and blue to purple in color, arranged in dense spikes, blooming from late summer to early fall and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fibrous, and deeply penetrating, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum occidentale is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in areas of California, Oregon, and Washington.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. This plant is commonly found in the coastal and mountainous regions of these states. It prefers cool, humid climates and is often associated with coniferous and mixed forests.</p>
<p>Aconitum occidentale is an important part of the native flora in these regions, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum occidentale was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly during the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It was brought for ornamental purposes due to its striking blue to purple flowers and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has since spread along riverbanks and in disturbed soils, often becoming invasive in certain regions. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns as it can outcompete native flora in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Aconitum occidentale is toxic and poses a risk to both wildlife and humans.</p>
