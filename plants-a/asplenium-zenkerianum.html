<p>Asplenium zenkerianum, commonly known as the Zenker's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rock crevices or on tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Asplenium zenkerianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
