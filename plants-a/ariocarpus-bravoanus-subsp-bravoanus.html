<p>Ariocarpus bravoanus subsp.</p>
<p>bravoanus, commonly known as the Bravo's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, and its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The fruit, which is edible, is covered in a waxy coating that protects it from desiccation.</p>
