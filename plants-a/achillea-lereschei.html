                <h1>Achillea lereschei</h1>
<p>Achillea lereschei, commonly known as the Leresche's yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and thrives in full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea lereschei has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-green bark, growing from the base of the plant. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind due to its feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in dry environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea lereschei is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across these areas, with some populations extending into northern Africa. This species thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea lereschei is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea lereschei is a perennial plant known for its ornamental foliage and resilience in gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. The growth cycle of Achillea lereschei involves a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth in spring and flowering in summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea lereschei is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its ability to deter pests. Additionally, its extensive root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Achillea lereschei also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea lereschei is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses, primarily found in specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>While it does not have widespread culinary applications, it may be used locally in traditional recipes or herbal infusions. Its medicinal properties are not well-studied, but it may share some characteristics with other members of the Asteraceae family, such as potential anti-inflammatory or antiseptic properties. In terms of industrial or economic value, it is not commercially significant.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic meaning in local traditions or folklore, though specific details are scarce.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea lereschei has several popular cultivars, including 'Paprika' and 'Crimson Star', which are valued for their vibrant red flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>While it is less commonly hybridized compared to other yarrow species, some horticulturalists have created crosses with Achillea millefolium to enhance flower color and hardiness. These cultivars are prized in gardens for their ability to thrive in well-drained soils and their long-lasting blooms. Due to their ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, they hold significant horticultural importance in perennial flower beds.</p>
<p>They are also used in landscape design to add color and texture to mixed borders.</p>
