                <h1>Aellenia postii</h1>
<p>Aellenia postii, commonly known as the Cape orchid, is a small, flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in coastal areas. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination.</p>
<p>Aellenia postii is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats along the south-western coast of South Africa.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aellenia postii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a spreading, shrub-like pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
