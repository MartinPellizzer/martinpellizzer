                <h1>Adicea lindeniana</h1>
<p>Adicea lindeniana, commonly known as the yellow balm, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a smooth texture.</p>
<p>Adicea lindeniana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea lindeniana has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green upper surface contrasting with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, woody, and have a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, blooming in late spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea lindeniana is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. This plant grows in grasslands and open woodlands, often in sandy or well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with fynbos vegetation types.</p>
<p>Adicea lindeniana is known for its distinctive blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea lindeniana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and streamside habitats. This plant has been observed spreading along disturbed soils and in areas with high humidity. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>It is often found in association with other non-native species in these ecosystems.</p>
