                <h1>Acinodendron centrodesmum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron centrodesmum, commonly known as the red-rooted acinodendron, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy, herbaceous stems and palmately lobed leaves. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals and stamens.</p>
<p>The plant's root system is notable for its deep, reddish coloration, which is a distinguishing feature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron centrodesmum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with four petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron centrodesmum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary forests, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. This plant is often associated with riverine and coastal areas, where the soil is rich in organic matter. It plays an important ecological role in these habitats by contributing to biodiversity and soil stability.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become increasingly restricted in recent years.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron centrodesmum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed or secondary forests.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it has been documented in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native regions, where it can sometimes become invasive.</p>
<p>This distribution pattern suggests that it is well-adapted to a variety of environmental conditions, making it a persistent and widespread species.</p>
