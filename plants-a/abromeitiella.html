<p>Abromeitiella, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their compact growth habit, hairy stems, and clusters of yellow to golden flowers. They are drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements.</p>
<p>Abromeitiella species play a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small insects and animals.</p>
