                <h1>Aegiphila floribunda</h1>
<p>Aegiphila floribunda, commonly known as the clustered goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a branching stem that supports its compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Aegiphila floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and subtle floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila floribunda has compound, opposite leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they are arranged in pairs along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming from spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb nutrients from the surface soil.</p>
