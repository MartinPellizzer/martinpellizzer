<p>Atemnosiphon coriaceus, commonly known as the rough-leaved water plant, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its thick, leathery leaves.</p>
<p>It is typically found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has a robust root system that helps anchor it in muddy substrates. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, which aids in capturing sunlight for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Atemnosiphon coriaceus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
