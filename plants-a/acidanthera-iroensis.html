                <h1>Acidanthera iroensis</h1>
<p>Acidanthera iroensis, commonly known as the Iroquois lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Iridaceae family, which includes many flowering plants known for their showy blooms. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, spurred flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Acidanthera iroensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidanthera iroensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat hairy, with a light green color and a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and typically pink or white, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidanthera iroensis is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas such as Georgia, Florida, and the Carolinas. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with wetlands and swampy areas. It is an herbaceous perennial that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidanthera iroensis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive purple flowers. Despite its beauty, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species. The plant spreads rapidly through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
