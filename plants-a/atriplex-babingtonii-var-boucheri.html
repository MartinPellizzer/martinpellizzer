                    <h1>Atriplex babingtonii var. boucheri</h1>
<p>Atriplex babingtonii var. boucheri, commonly known as Boucher's saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are typically covered in a layer of fine, salt-excreting hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
