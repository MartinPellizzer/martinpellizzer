                    <h1>Amygdalus persica var. duplex</h1>
<p>Amygdalus persica var. duplex, commonly known as the double-flowered peach, is a botanical variant of the peach tree characterized by its unique floral structure.</p>
<p>This cultivar produces double flowers, meaning the typical single bloom is replaced by multiple layers of petals, creating a more showy appearance. The plant retains the genetic traits of the common peach, including its fruit-bearing capability and growth habits. Its flowers are often more fragrant and longer-lasting than those of the standard variety.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
