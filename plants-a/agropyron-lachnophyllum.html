<p>Agropyron lachnophyllum, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold, arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Agropyron lachnophyllum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
