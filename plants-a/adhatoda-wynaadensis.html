                <h1>Adhatoda wynaadensis</h1>
<p>Adhatoda wynaadensis, commonly known as the Indian skullcap, is a shrub native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds.</p>
<p>Adhatoda wynaadensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported respiratory and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda wynaadensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a slightly serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green to brownish bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are clustered in panicles, with tubular corolla, usually pink or purple in color, blooming during the monsoon season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda wynaadensis is primarily native to India, particularly the southern regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka. This plant thrives in moist environments and is often seen growing in forested areas and along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of Sri Lanka and the Nicobar Islands.</p>
<p>Adhatoda wynaadensis is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda wynaadensis was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates, particularly in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. This plant has been introduced for its ornamental value due to its attractive, heart-shaped leaves and showy flowers. It is also sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential to become an invasive species in certain ecosystems.</p>
