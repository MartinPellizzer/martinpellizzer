The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>The morphological variability of this fern contributes to its classification as a form, highlighting its adaptability to different ecological conditions.</p>
