                <h1>Adiantum proximum</h1>
<p>Adiantum proximum, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to various regions in North America. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Adiantum proximum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum proximum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lacey appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, ranging from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The fronds are usually a deep green color, with a smooth, leathery texture.</p>
<p>The plant has a slender, upright stem that is smooth and green, growing in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum proximum is primarily native to the eastern United States, including states such as North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky stream banks. This fern thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often associated with mountainous regions and is a common sight in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>Adiantum proximum is also found in parts of eastern Mexico, where it grows in similar ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum proximum was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It was brought there by early settlers and has since become naturalized in moist, shaded habitats. This fern thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to its presence in both wild and cultivated settings.</p>
