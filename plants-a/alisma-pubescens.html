                    <h1>Alisma pubescens</h1>
<p>Alisma pubescens, commonly known as the hairy water plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, cylindrical stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its leaves are elongated and float on the water surface, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Alisma pubescens is often found in shallow water, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem dynamics.</p>
