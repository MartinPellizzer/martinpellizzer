                <h1>Acer monspessulanum subsp. ibericum</h1>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>ibericum, commonly known as the Iberian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray-brown bark.</p>
<p>The leaves are palmate with five lobes, turning vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to limestone soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including forests and scrublands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>ibericum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside. The stem is straight and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a shrub-like growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in catkins, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the plant's natural habitat in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>ibericum is a rare and ancient tree species native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically found in southern Spain and northern Portugal. While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is restricted to a few isolated populations in the Sierra de Gredos and other mountainous regions. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and open woodlands, typically at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is considered critically endangered, with conservation efforts underway to protect and propagate this unique subspecies.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>ibericum is a slow-growing, ornamental tree known for its striking red and orange autumn foliage. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>The tree has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in well-drained, loamy soil with regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with horticultural oils.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a healthy garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>ibericum is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing the growth of other species through mutualistic relationships. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility and supporting surrounding plant life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>ibericum is a rare and ornamental tree native to the Iberian Peninsula, known for its unique leaf structure and ecological value. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its wood has been historically valued for small-scale crafts and furniture due to its fine grain and durability.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it has been used to treat respiratory and digestive ailments, though scientific validation remains limited. Culturally, it holds significance in local landscapes and is often appreciated for its aesthetic contribution to natural environments.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting biodiversity and as a symbol of regional identity further highlights its ecological and cultural importance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>ibericum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities. Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Red Sunset', which are known for their striking red foliage.</p>
<p>Hybrids with other maple species, such as *Acer palmatum*, have been developed to enhance color and growth habits. These cultivars and hybrids are important in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>Their use in landscaping highlights the species' significance in both public and private gardens.</p>
