<p>Asplenium serra, commonly known as the serrate spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, woodlands, and stream banks. The plant has a compact, creeping growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that have serrated edges. Its fronds are usually less than 10 centimeters in length, and it produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Asplenium serra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
