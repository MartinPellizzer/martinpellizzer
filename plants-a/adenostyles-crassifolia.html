                <h1>Adenostyles crassifolia</h1>
<p>Adenostyles crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved adenostyle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a slightly wavy margin.</p>
<p>Adenostyles crassifolia is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles crassifolia has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and branched, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles crassifolia is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is particularly common in the southern and central parts of California.</p>
<p>Adenostyles crassifolia is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles crassifolia was mainly introduced to California, where it has become naturalized in certain areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, particularly in the southern parts of the state. This plant is often associated with disturbed soils and can thrive in areas with mild, Mediterranean climates. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal.</p>
