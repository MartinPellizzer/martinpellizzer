<p>Archontophoenix alexandrae var. schizanthera, commonly known as the Alexandra palm, is a rare and striking palm species native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 5 meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers arranged in branched clusters, which eventually develop into clustered, orange-red fruits. Its unique botanical features make it a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and requires careful cultivation and protection.</p>
