<p>Anil suaveolens, commonly known as sweet woodruff, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the base of the stems. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Sweet woodruff is often used in herbal medicine and as a flavoring agent due to its mild, pleasant scent.</p>
