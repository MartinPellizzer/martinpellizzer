<p>Aspidium falcinellum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length.
