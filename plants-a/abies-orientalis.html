                    <h1>Abies orientalis</h1>
<p>Abies orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern Hemlock, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its distinctive, flat, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it plays an important role in forest ecosystems.</p>
