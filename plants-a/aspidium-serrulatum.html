                    <h1>Aspidium serrulatum</h1>
<p>Aspidium serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated fronds that are often submerged in water, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Aspidium serrulatum plays a minor but important role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
