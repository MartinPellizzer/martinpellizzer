                    <h1>Acacia canescens</h1>
<p>Acacia canescens, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to greyish bark and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which are followed by flat, linear pods containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with deep roots and a capacity to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia.</p>
<p>Acacia canescens is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fuel.</p>
