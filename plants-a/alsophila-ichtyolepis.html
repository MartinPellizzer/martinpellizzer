                    <h1>Alsophila ichtyolepis</h1>
<p>Alsophila ichtyolepis, commonly known as the fish-scale tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, light-green fronds that give it a delicate appearance. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow in the dark, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
