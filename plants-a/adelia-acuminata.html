                <h1>Adelia acuminata</h1>
<p>Adelia acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>Adelia acuminata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia acuminata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a smooth upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and attached filaments.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and helping it absorb nutrients and water efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia acuminata is primarily native to the eastern regions of Australia, specifically Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in subtropical and tropical rainforests, often growing in shaded, moist environments. The plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, typically near the base of trees or on rocky outcrops. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Adelia acuminata is also occasionally found in coastal areas, where it adapts to slightly different environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia acuminata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become a problematic invasive species in certain regions. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
