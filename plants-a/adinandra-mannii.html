                <h1>Adinandra mannii</h1>
<p>Adinandra mannii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western and central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The tree has simple, opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and high wood value, Adinandra mannii is often threatened by overexploitation and habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra mannii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles, blooming from September to November, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody drupe that splits open to release three seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra mannii is primarily native to tropical Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist lowland forests and sometimes in swampy areas. The plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with riverine and coastal habitats. It is also occasionally found in parts of Southeast Asia, though its main distribution remains in Africa.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra mannii was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high rainfall and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas across Southeast Asia, including countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with disturbed or degraded habitats. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and agricultural landscapes.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it has been introduced.</p>
