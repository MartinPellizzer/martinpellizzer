                    <h1>Acrolophus paniculatus</h1>
<p>Acrolophus paniculatus, commonly known as the panicled acrolophus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features finely divided, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale yellow, are arranged in compound umbels, a feature common in the carrot family.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry schizocarp that splits into two mericarps upon maturity, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
