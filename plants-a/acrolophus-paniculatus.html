                <h1>Acrolophus paniculatus</h1>
<p>Acrolophus paniculatus, commonly known as the panicled acrolophus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features finely divided, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale yellow, are arranged in compound umbels, a feature common in the carrot family.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry schizocarp that splits into two mericarps upon maturity, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolophus paniculatus has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface and lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five pale yellow petals, blooming during the spring and summer months, and they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolophus paniculatus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodland and grassland habitats. The plant thrives in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed sites and can be found in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends to parts of southern and eastern Africa where the climate supports its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolophus paniculatus was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as trade and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with warm climates and well-drained soils. This plant has adapted well to disturbed habitats, including roadsides and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via wind-dispersed seeds contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
