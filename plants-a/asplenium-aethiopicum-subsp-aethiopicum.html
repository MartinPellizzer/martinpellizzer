<p>Asplenium aethiopicum subsp.</p>
<p>aethiopicum, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Africa and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy.</p>
<p>The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
