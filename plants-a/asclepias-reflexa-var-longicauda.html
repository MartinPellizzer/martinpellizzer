<p>Asclepias reflexa var. longicauda, commonly known as the long-tailed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Asclepias reflexa var. longicauda is an important host plant for the larvae of the monarch butterfly.</p>
