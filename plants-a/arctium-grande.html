                    <h1>Arctium grande</h1>
<p>Arctium grande, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flowers arranged in a dense, spherical cluster at the top of the stem. Its most distinctive feature is the prickly, bur-like seed heads that cling to clothing and animal fur, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Arctium grande is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows.</p>
