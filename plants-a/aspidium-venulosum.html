                    <h1>Aspidium venulosum</h1>
<p>Aspidium venulosum, commonly known as the veiny water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a network of veins, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in wet habitats.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
