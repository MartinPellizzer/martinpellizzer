<p>Astracantha thracica subsp.</p>
<p>parnassi, commonly known as the Parnassian bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers, which are typically blue or violet in color.</p>
<p>The plant grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
