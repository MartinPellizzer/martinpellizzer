                <h1>Acrostichum araneosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum araneosum, commonly known as the nettle fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, stinging hairs, similar to those found on true nettles. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its fronds are divided into narrow, feather-like segments, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>Acrostichum araneosum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum araneosum has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, measuring up to 1 meter in length and varying in color from dark green to a bluish-green.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that has a fibrous texture. It produces inconspicuous, greenish flowers in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spadix that develops into a cluster of small, dark berries, and the seeds are dispersed by water and animals.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum araneosum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, wetlands, and mangrove forests where it thrives in humid, saline environments. This plant is particularly abundant in countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and the Caribbean islands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to its ability to tolerate saltwater and fluctuating water levels.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum araneosum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, wetlands, and disturbed sites where it can thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its rapid growth and dense foliage. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to both ecological and economic impacts in various parts of the globe.</p>
