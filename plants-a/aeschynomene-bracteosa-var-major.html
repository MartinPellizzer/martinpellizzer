                    <h1>Aeschynomene bracteosa var. major</h1>
<p>Aeschynomene bracteosa var. major, commonly known as the broad-leafed aeschynomene, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
