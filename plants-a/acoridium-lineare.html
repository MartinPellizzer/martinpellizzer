                <h1>Acoridium lineare</h1>
<p>Acoridium lineare, commonly known as the linear acorus, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Acoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that float on the water's surface, with a distinct midrib running along the length of each leaf. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, a feature common in many monocot plants. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands.</p>
<p>Acoridium lineare plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium lineare has linear, grass-like leaves that are narrow, elongated, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green color and grows upright. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, blooming in the spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind after maturation.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread horizontally near the soil surface, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium lineare is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is typically associated with lowland forests and is sometimes seen in swampy areas. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and New Guinea.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium lineare was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and can thrive in a variety of soil types. It has been reported as an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to other introduced plant species in the area.</p>
