                    <h1>Aphyllodium glossocarpum</h1>
<p>Aphyllodium glossocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-leafed sandplant, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to scales, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Aphyllodium glossocarpum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
