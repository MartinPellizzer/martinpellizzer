                    <h1>Avena trichophylla</h1>
<p>Avena trichophylla, commonly known as the hairy oat, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Avena trichophylla thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various herbivorous animals and its contribution to soil stabilization in rugged terrain.</p>
