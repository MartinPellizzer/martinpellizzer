                    <h1>Arthraxon ciliaris var. cryptatherus</h1>
<p>Arthraxon ciliaris var. cryptatherus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arthraxon, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland margins.</p>
<p>Due to its low profile and dense growth, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
