<p>Adiantum burnii, commonly known as the Persian maidenhair fern, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Iran and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive blackish midrib that contrasts with the lighter green pinnae.</p>
<p>Adiantum burnii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its elegant appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum burnii has fern-like leaves that are pinnate, with a delicate, finely divided structure, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green, with a light green or sometimes silvery underside, and they vary in size from 10 to 20 centimeters in length. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively hidden beneath the foliage. Adiantum burnii produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>

<p>Adiantum burnii is a hardy plant that is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum burnii was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it suitable for gardens and woodland areas. This plant is often cultivated for its delicate, fern-like foliage and ornamental value. It has been introduced as a decorative plant in horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
