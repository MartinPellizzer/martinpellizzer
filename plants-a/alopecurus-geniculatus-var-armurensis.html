                    <h1>Alopecurus geniculatus var. armurensis</h1>
<p>Alopecurus geniculatus var. armurensis, commonly known as the armored bentgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often reddish stems.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and grasslands. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its name, "armurensis," refers to the armored appearance of its stems, which are covered in fine, stiff hairs.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
