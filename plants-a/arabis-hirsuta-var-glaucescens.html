                    <h1>Arabis hirsuta var. glaucescens</h1>
<p>Arabis hirsuta var. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, glaucous (bluish-gray) leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its foliage is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
