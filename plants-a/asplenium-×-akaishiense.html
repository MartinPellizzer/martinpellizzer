                    <h1>Asplenium × akaishiense</h1>
<p>Asplenium × akaishiense, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium scolopendrium*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Asplenium × akaishiense is valued for its ornamental appearance and is cultivated in gardens and conservatories.</p>
