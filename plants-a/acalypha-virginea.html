                        <h1>Acalypha virginea</h1>
<p>Acalypha virginea, commonly known as the red-hot catshrub, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking red bracts that resemble cat whiskers, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers clustered within the bracts. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Acalypha virginea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage and unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha virginea is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is also native to parts of Australia, particularly in the northeastern regions. It thrives in humid climates and is often seen in rainforests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to some islands in the Pacific Ocean as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha virginea was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the late 19th century by European settlers who admired its aesthetic value. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a potential weed in certain regions of New Zealand. The plant spreads through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and animals, contributing to its rapid establishment in natural habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species in sensitive ecosystems.</p>
