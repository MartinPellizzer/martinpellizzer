                <h1>Achillea × decolorans</h1>
<p>Achillea × decolorans, commonly known as the lesser yarrow, is a hybrid plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-green foliage and flat-topped clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. Native to Europe, it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas. The plant's name references its tendency to fade in color, a trait that distinguishes it from its parent species.</p>
<p>It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × decolorans has compound, basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cypsela, a type of dry, indehiscent seed, which is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × decolorans is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of Europe, including southern England, France, and parts of Spain, often in disturbed or cultivated areas. This species thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin and limited natural range, it is considered a rare plant with a conservation status that is currently listed as vulnerable in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × decolorans is a hybrid perennial plant known for its showy, flat umbels of white to pink flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter and active growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too wet.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea × decolorans is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, which contribute to the overall biodiversity of the ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through improved soil conditions. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and habitat for small insects and invertebrates, supporting a healthy ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea × decolorans is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its attractive, daisy-like flowers.</p>
<p>It is primarily used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in various soil conditions.
