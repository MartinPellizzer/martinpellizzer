                <h1>Adicea ceratocalyx</h1>
<p>Adicea ceratocalyx, commonly known as the horned hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny calyx that resembles horns, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. It typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as wetlands and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Adicea ceratocalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea ceratocalyx has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly furrowed with age, and it grows upright with a branched pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring five white petals and five yellow sepals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea ceratocalyx is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along riverbanks. This plant is also present in some regions of Africa, particularly in the tropical rainforests of West and Central Africa. It is commonly associated with humid climates and is often found in lowland areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to warm, humid environments with high rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea ceratocalyx was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it particularly successful in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
