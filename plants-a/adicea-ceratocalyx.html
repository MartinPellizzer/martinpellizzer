                <h1>Adicea ceratocalyx</h1>
<p>Adicea ceratocalyx, commonly known as the horned hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers with prominent, horn-like calyx. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture, and it produces vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Adicea ceratocalyx is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea ceratocalyx has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a creeping growth pattern that often forms low mats. Its flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, with five pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea ceratocalyx is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of tropical regions where it was originally native, though it is not widely cultivated outside its natural range. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests, often growing near the forest floor. This species is typically found at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is considered vulnerable, though it is not yet classified as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adicea ceratocalyx is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and relatively easy cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Adicea ceratocalyx includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth and blooming in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning after flowering promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or root rot if conditions are not properly managed.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adicea ceratocalyx is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for its reproduction and the health of the ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native species in its vicinity. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it can serve as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and benefiting surrounding vegetation.</p>
