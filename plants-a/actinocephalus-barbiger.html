                <h1>Actinocephalus barbiger</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus barbiger, commonly known as the hairy actinocephalus, is a unique member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, and hairy stems that give it a rugged appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus barbiger has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically green in color and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread horizontally near the soil surface, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus barbiger is primarily native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the western and southern regions of the country. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky areas and shrublands. It is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat.</p>
<p>The species is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its distinctive, spiky appearance.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus barbiger was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in the region. The plant was likely introduced through human activities, such as accidental transport in soil or on equipment. It thrives in disturbed habitats and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
