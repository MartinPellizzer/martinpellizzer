<p>Anabasis macroptera, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and succulent stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Anabasis macroptera is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
