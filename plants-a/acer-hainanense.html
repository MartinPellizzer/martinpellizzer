<p>Acer hainanense, commonly known as the Hainan maple, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and have a vibrant green color during the growing season. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>
