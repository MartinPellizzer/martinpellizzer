                <h1>Achillea anthemiformis</h1>
<p>Achillea anthemiformis, commonly known as yellow archangel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in gardens and natural areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea anthemiformis has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a gray-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a slightly hairy surface, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are small, composite, yellowish-green in color, and arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and pappus structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea anthemiformis is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in countries such as Italy, Spain, and Portugal.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southern Europe and the Mediterranean basin, where it thrives in rocky and gravelly soils. This species prefers open, sunny environments such as grasslands, slopes, and disturbed areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea anthemiformis is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea anthemiformis is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea anthemiformis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit offers shelter and habitat for various insects and small wildlife. It acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by improving soil conditions. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>This plant also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and promoting a healthy ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea anthemiformis is a flowering plant known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies to treat ailments such as digestive issues and skin conditions.</p>
<p>It has also been explored for its potential in the pharmaceutical industry due to its bioactive compounds. In some regions, it holds cultural significance and is used in traditional rituals or as a symbol of resilience. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its ornamental value makes it a popular choice in gardens and landscaping.</p>
