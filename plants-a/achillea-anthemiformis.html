                <h1>Achillea anthemiformis</h1>
<p>Achillea anthemiformis, commonly known as the sweet everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features finely divided, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea anthemiformis has basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are grayish-green in color, arranged in a rosette, and are covered with fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody as the plant matures. Its flower heads are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea anthemiformis is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France.</p>
<p>It is now found in several regions across Europe, including Spain, Portugal, and Italy, as well as in some parts of North Africa. This species thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and woodland edges. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea anthemiformis is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although its populations are considered relatively rare and require conservation efforts to maintain their habitats.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea anthemiformis is a hardy perennial known for its showy yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seeds sown in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea anthemiformis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>It also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>
