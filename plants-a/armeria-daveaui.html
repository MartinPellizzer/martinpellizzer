                    <h1>Armeria daveaui</h1>
<p>Armeria daveaui, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Its leaves are linear and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Armeria daveaui is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
