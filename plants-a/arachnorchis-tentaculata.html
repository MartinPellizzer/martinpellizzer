                    <h1>Arachnorchis tentaculata</h1>
<p>Arachnorchis tentaculata, commonly known as the tentacle orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features a pseudobulb that supports its growth and stores water, which is essential for surviving in its often dry habitat. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with long, slender petals and a distinctive, thread-like structure called a tentacle. It typically blooms in spring and is found in rainforest and dry forest regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
