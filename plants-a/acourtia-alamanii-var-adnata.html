                    <h1>Acourtia alamanii var. adnata</h1>
<p>Acourtia alamanii var. adnata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its small, oval seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Acourtia alamanii var. adnata is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils and can go through periods of dormancy during droughts.</p>
