                <h1>Acer dasycarpum f. lutescens</h1>
<p>Acer dasycarpum f. lutescens, commonly known as the golden-flowered maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that appear in early spring, contrasting with its palmate leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found at higher elevations. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it produces samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum f. lutescens has palmately compound leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a bright yellow-green color during the growing season and turning orange-red in autumn; the leaves are arranged alternately along the stem and are relatively large, measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in racemes, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with a winged structure, dispersing by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils in which the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum f. lutescens is a rare variant of the Himalayan maple, native to the mountainous regions of eastern Nepal and northern India.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it is now also found in botanical gardens and collections in Europe and North America due to cultivation efforts. It thrives in temperate climates, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils within forested areas. This species is commonly found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation attention.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum f. lutescens is a rare and attractive maple variety known for its golden foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning should be done in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or shrubs enhances its visual appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum f. lutescens is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other plant species. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality in its surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum f. lutescens is a variant of the maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While not widely used in culinary applications, it is valued in landscaping for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique yellow leaves. In traditional medicine, its bark and leaves may have been used for their potential anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation is limited. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and provides habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and natural beauty, often appreciated in horticulture and botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum f. lutescens has several popular cultivars that are highly valued in horticulture, such as 'Aureum' and 'Luteum', known for their striking golden foliage.</p>
<p>These cultivars are often used in ornamental gardens due to their vibrant autumn colors and compact growth habit. Hybrids involving Acer dasycarpum f. lutescens are less common but may be developed to enhance specific traits like disease resistance or leaf color intensity.
