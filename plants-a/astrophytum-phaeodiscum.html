<p>Astrophytum phaeodiscum, commonly known as the blue ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, rounded stems that are covered in a thick layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces pale blue or violet flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Astrophytum phaeodiscum is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions with minimal water.</p>
