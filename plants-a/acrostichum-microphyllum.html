                <h1>Acrostichum microphyllum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved brake fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and small, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps anchor it to the substrate and absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately compound, with closely spaced, small pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum microphyllum has narrow, feather-like leaves that are elongated, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length, with a bright green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread vegetatively and stabilize the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum microphyllum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and other wetland habitats. This plant thrives in humid, saline environments and is often associated with estuaries and tidal flats. Its native range includes countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum microphyllum was mainly introduced to the coastal areas of Florida and the Gulf Coast of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, estuaries, and other brackish water environments. This plant has been reported in several states including Florida, Louisiana, and Texas. Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as land development and the movement of aquatic plants.</p>
<p>It has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
