<p>Arnica tabularis, commonly known as the flatleaf arnica, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Siberia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its medicinal properties have been historically used for treating bruises and inflammation, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution in use.</p>
<p>Arnica tabularis is also valued for its role in ecological systems, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
