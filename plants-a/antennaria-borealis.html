                    <h1>Antennaria borealis</h1>
<p>Antennaria borealis, commonly known as the northern mouse-eared moss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tiny, hairy leaves and clustered yellow flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to extreme cold and strong winds. Its small stature and dense growth habit help it conserve heat and reduce desiccation.</p>
<p>Antennaria borealis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms.</p>
