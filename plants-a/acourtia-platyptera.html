                <h1>Acourtia platyptera</h1>
<p>Acourtia platyptera, commonly known as the flat-leaf acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Its leaves are broad and flat, which helps it conserve water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acourtia platyptera is a perennial species that thrives in full sun and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia platyptera has leaves that are oblanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dull green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branched. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia platyptera is primarily native to Mexico Central and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in regions characterized by arid and semi-arid climates. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Acourtia platyptera is well adapted to the environmental conditions of these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to specific areas within these geographical boundaries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia platyptera was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a potential ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in coastal and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local biodiversity.</p>
