                <h1>Adiantum wilsonii</h1>
<p>Adiantum wilsonii, commonly known as the Wilson's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive zigzag pattern along the veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, spoon-shaped pinnae that give it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum wilsonii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum wilsonii has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually slender, with a dark green color and a finely divided structure, and they can grow up to 30 cm in length. The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a branching pattern. Adiantum wilsonii produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, fleshy capsule that disperses seeds through wind, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum wilsonii is primarily native to Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, Nicaragua, Panam√°, Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing near streams or in dense forest understories. Adiantum wilsonii is a member of the fern family and is known for its delicate, lace-like fronds.</p>
<p>Its native distribution spans much of Central and South America, with a presence in several Caribbean islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum wilsonii was mainly introduced to regions with moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures, making it suitable for temperate climates. This plant is commonly found in the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, fern-like fronds.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been largely limited to specific ecological niches where it can maintain a stable population.</p>
