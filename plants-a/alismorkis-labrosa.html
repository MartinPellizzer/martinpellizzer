<p>Alismorkis labrosa, commonly known as the broadleaf water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow leaves that are typically floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Alismorkis labrosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality.</p>
