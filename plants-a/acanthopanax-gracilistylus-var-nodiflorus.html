                        <h1>Acanthopanax gracilistylus var. nodiflorus</h1>
<p>Acanthopanax gracilistylus var. nodiflorus, commonly known as the clustered-flowered angel's trumpets, is a climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with elongated, serrated leaflets and produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and thorny branches, which are typical of the genus Acanthopanax. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The flowers give way to small, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax gracilistylus var. nodiflorus is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates, often growing in dense forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This variant is known for its distinctive branched stems and small, clustered flowers, which are adapted to the humid and cool conditions of its native habitat. It is commonly found in rocky soils and along forest edges, where it can receive adequate sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax gracilistylus var. nodiflorus was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in forested regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and partial to full sunlight. This plant is commonly found in the mountainous areas of eastern Asia, including parts of China and Korea. It has been introduced to various ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
