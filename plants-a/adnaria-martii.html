                <h1>Adnaria martii</h1>
<p>Adnaria martii, commonly known as the Mediterranean sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and saline soils. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Its leaves are ovate and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Adnaria martii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with saline tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria martii has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria martii is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found along coastal areas and in rocky habitats, including cliffs and shores. The plant thrives in temperate climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. It is often associated with maritime environments and is sometimes found in association with other halophytic species.</p>
<p>Adnaria martii is a low-growing shrub that plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria martii was mainly introduced to coastal and brackish water environments in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in estuaries, lagoons, and tidal zones where it thrives in shallow, saline conditions. This plant has been reported in several countries including Italy, Greece, and Turkey. Its introduction is believed to be due to both natural dispersal and human-assisted spread.</p>
<p>Adnaria martii plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
