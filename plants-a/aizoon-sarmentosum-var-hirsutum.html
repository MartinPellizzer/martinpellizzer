<p>Aizoon sarmentosum var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy trailing germander, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features wiry, prostrate stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to drought conditions, with succulent stems that store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
