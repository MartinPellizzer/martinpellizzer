                <h1>Adiantum scabripes</h1>
<p>Adiantum scabripes, commonly known as the rusty maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive rusty coloration on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller segments, giving it a finely divided appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum scabripes is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum scabripes has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are finely toothed and usually have a silvery-white underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and wiry with a smooth, light green bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, with spores rather than true flowers, and relies on wind pollination. The plant does not produce fruits or seeds; instead, it reproduces via spores released from sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it anchor in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum scabripes is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and parts of Alabama.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of streams and ponds. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments with consistently moist soil. It is often seen growing on the ground or on rocky surfaces in these habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range is largely confined to the coastal plain regions of the southeastern U.S.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum scabripes was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This fern is often used in horticulture due to its ornamental value and adaptability. It has been reported in several states including Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
