                <h1>Adiantum lathomi</h1>
<p>Adiantum lathomi, commonly known as the Lathom's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum lathomi is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum lathomi has fern-like leaves that are triangular in shape, with a delicate, feathery appearance, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, ranging from 10 to 20 centimeters in length, and have a bright green color that remains consistent throughout the growing season. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a simple, unbranched pattern. Adiantum lathomi does not produce flowers; instead, it reproduces through spores released from tiny, clustered structures on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Its roots are rhizomatous, forming a network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>

<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This fern thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is particularly associated with the coastal ranges and the Sierra Nevada foothills.</p>
<p>Adiantum lathomi is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum lathomi was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is believed to have been brought there by humans, possibly as an ornamental plant. The distribution of this species is limited to the islands of Hawaii. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and rock crevices.</p>
