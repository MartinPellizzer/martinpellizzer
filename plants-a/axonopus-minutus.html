                    <h1>Axonopus minutus</h1>
<p>Axonopus minutus, commonly known as carpet grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It forms dense mats of fine, grass-like foliage that often carpet the ground, making it a common weed in lawns and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, flat leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and spreading habit, it can be both a desirable ground cover and an invasive species in certain areas.</p>
