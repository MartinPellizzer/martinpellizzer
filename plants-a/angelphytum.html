                    <h1>Angelphytum</h1>
<p>Angelphytum, commonly known as the desert angel or angel's flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where they thrive in hot, dry climates. Angelphytum species are characterized by their fleshy, succulent leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. They are often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>The plants have a shallow root system and are adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
