<p>Achillea umbellata subsp.</p>
<p>vulgaris, commonly known as common yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of dark green, thread-like leaves and produces flat, clustered inflorescences of white to pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its aromatic, slightly bitter scent and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. It has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea umbellata subsp.</p>
<p>vulgaris has leaves that are basal, lanceolate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture. The stem is upright, herbaceous, and has a light green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The flowers are composite, consisting of ray florets and disk florets, with a pale yellow to white color, blooming from late spring to early summer. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea umbellata subsp.</p>
<p>vulgaris is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and western Asia. While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific areas in Spain, Portugal, and parts of southern France.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils, often in sunny environments. This species typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea umbellata subsp.</p>
<p>vulgaris is a hardy perennial known for its fragrant, flat-topped flower heads and silver-green foliage. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, going through active growth in spring and summer, followed by a rest period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize it lightly in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune faded flower heads to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, thyme, or other aromatic herbs can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
