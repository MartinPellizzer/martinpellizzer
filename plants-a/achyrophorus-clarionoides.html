                <h1>Achyrophorus clarionoides</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus clarionoides, commonly known as the Clarion sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal dunes of California.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It thrives in coastal environments where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus clarionoides has simple, alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a moderate size and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows in a creeping or trailing manner. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus clarionoides is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in saturated soil conditions and is often associated with coastal and inland wetland habitats. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches that provide the moist environment it requires for growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus clarionoides was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high moisture levels, such as marshes and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in nutrient-rich environments and often colonizes areas after natural or human-induced disturbances. Its introduction has been documented in several regions across North America.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential and ecological impact remain subjects of ongoing research.</p>
