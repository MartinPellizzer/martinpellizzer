                <h1>Adina trichotoma</h1>
<p>Adina trichotoma, commonly known as the African rosewood or African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by red or orange berries containing flat, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Adina trichotoma is often found in moist forests and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina trichotoma has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina trichotoma is a small shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Madagascar and the Comoros Islands as well, though its range has been reduced due to habitat loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. Adina trichotoma is typically found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological importance, it is listed as endangered due to deforestation and habitat degradation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adina trichotoma is a fast-growing, shrub-like plant native to Africa, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for quick results. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant and encourage bushier growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adina trichotoma is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and benefiting surrounding vegetation. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Overall, Adina trichotoma plays a vital ecological role in supporting biodiversity and maintaining soil health.</p>
