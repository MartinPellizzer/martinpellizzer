<p>Acalypha giraldii, commonly known as the flame bush, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Caribbean, including parts of Cuba, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. The plant is characterized by its striking red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves, not flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Acalypha giraldii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha giraldii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a waxy appearance, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a bright green color that may turn reddish in autumn. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, ranging in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha giraldii is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar, where it grows in specific forest habitats.</p>
<p>It is currently found primarily in the northeastern region of the island, particularly in humid evergreen forests. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments with rich soil, typically found in lowland to mid-elevation areas. It is generally found at altitudes ranging from 50 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acalypha giraldii is considered to be of conservation concern, with its status listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
