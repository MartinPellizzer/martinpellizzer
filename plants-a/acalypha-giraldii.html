<p>Acalypha giraldii, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking foliage with bright red veins contrasting against dark green leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 meter and features small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Acalypha giraldii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique leaf patterns.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha giraldii is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the northeastern region. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forested areas. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is commonly seen in secondary vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species to Madagascar.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha giraldii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction make it an aggressive colonizer.</p>
<p>However, it is not typically considered invasive in its native range.</p>
