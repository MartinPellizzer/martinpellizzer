<p>It is also found in the Caribbean, including the Bahamas and Cuba. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps, hammocks, and along stream banks. It is well adapted to wetland habitats and is often associated with hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abatia tomentosa f. parvifolia was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, railroads, and abandoned fields. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions.</p>
