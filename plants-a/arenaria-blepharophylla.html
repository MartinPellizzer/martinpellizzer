                    <h1>Arenaria blepharophylla</h1>
<p>Arenaria blepharophylla, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
