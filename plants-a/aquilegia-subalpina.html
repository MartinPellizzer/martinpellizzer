<p>It features showy, spurred flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with five petals and two elongated nectar-rich spurs. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
