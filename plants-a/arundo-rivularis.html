                    <h1>Arundo rivularis</h1>
<p>Arundo rivularis, commonly known as the river reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, riverbanks, and other moist environments, forming dense stands that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves and produces small, fluffy flowers in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both an ecological pioneer and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils.</p>
