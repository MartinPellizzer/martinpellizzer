                    <h1>Acer intermedium f. optentum</h1>
<p>Acer intermedium f. optentum, commonly known as the silver maple variant, is a cultivar of the maple tree characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical Acer intermedium, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces. The leaves are typically palmately lobed with a smooth margin, and they turn vibrant yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>The tree is relatively fast-growing and can reach heights of up to 15 meters under optimal conditions.</p>
