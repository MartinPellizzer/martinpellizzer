                    <h1>Arceuthobium oxycedri</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium oxycedri, commonly known as the cedar dodder, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of cedar trees.</p>
<p>It lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and is often found in forested areas where its host trees are present. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and health of its host, making it an important indicator of cedar forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized relationship, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
