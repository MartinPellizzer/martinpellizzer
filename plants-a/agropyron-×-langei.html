                    <h1>Agropyron × langei</h1>
<p>Agropyron × langei, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Agropyron repens (quackgrass) and Agropyron cristatum (crested wheatgrass), resulting in a plant with a combination of traits from both parents. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it valuable for land restoration projects. It produces spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including those that are dry or sandy.</p>
<p>Agropyron × langei is often used in agricultural and ecological settings due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
