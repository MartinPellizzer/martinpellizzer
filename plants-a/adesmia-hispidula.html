                <h1>Adesmia hispidula</h1>
<p>Adesmia hispidula, commonly known as the rough adesmia, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, compound leaves. Its flowers are usually pale or white, with a distinctive spurred petal.</p>
<p>Adesmia hispidula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia hispidula has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and covered in fine hairs, with a light greenish-brown bark that remains smooth as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia hispidula is primarily native to Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean regions of the country. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky, and mountainous habitats. It is adapted to the high-altitude conditions of the Peruvian Andes.</p>
<p>Adesmia hispidula is part of the legume family and is known for its small, hairy leaves and yellow flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia hispidula was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in parts of South America and the Caribbean. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including agriculture and land clearing.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
