                    <h1>Astragalus ammotrophus</h1>
<p>Astragalus ammotrophus, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect stem, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pods that contain several elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Astragalus ammotrophus plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
