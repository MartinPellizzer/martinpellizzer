                    <h1>Aridaria longituba</h1>
<p>Aridaria longituba, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often branching near the base. The plant produces clusters of trumpet-shaped, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Aridaria longituba is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can go through extended periods of drought.</p>
