                <h1>Achyranthes porphyrostachya</h1>
<p>Achyranthes porphyrostachya, commonly known as the purple-stemmed smartweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to parts of Asia, including China and India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems that often display a distinctive purplish hue, particularly in the stems and leaf axils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Achyranthes porphyrostachya is often found in moist soils along riverbanks, wetlands, and disturbed areas, and it is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes porphyrostachya has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and somewhat woody, with a rough, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with stamen and pistil structures, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its small, black seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
