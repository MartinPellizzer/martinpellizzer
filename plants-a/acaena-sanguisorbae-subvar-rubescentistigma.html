<p>Acaena sanguisorbae subvar. rubescentistigma, commonly known as the red-stigma bramble, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, spiny leaves and produces bright red, showy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant's fruits are small, red berries that are edible and often consumed by birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae subvar. rubescentistigma is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions of the western and central areas. This subvariety thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with grasslands and shrublands at high elevations.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the cool, moist conditions typical of New Zealand's highland zones.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae subvar. rubescentistigma was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
