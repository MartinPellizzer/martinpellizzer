<p>Athyrium alpestre subsp.</p>
<p>americanum, commonly known as the Appalachian lady fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arching and gracefully shaped.</p>
<p>The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
