The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions for successful cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
