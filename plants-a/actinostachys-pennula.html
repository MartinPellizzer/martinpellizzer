                <h1>Actinostachys pennula</h1>
<p>Actinostachys pennula, commonly known as the feather-stemmed horsetail, is a member of the Equisetaceae family, characterized by its ancient lineage and unique morphology.</p>
<p>This plant features a tall, slender stem with a distinctive whorl of leaves at the top, giving it a feathery appearance. It possesses a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, typical of its primitive reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Actinostachys pennula is often found in wetlands and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostachys pennula has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a grass-like appearance, typically ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green to brownish bark that becomes more rugged with age. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters during the spring, with a greenish-yellow color, and relies on wind pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds through wind, and the plant has fibrous roots that help anchor it in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostachys pennula is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including parts of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and rivers. This plant is commonly found in the coastal regions of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. It prefers moist, sandy soils and is often associated with disturbed or transitional habitats.</p>
<p>Actinostachys pennula plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostachys pennula was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It was originally native to Central and South America but has been widely cultivated for its ornamental value. This plant is often found in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sunny environments and can spread through rhizomes, contributing to its rapid colonization of new areas.</p>
