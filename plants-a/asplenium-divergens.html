<p>Asplenium divergens, commonly known as the fan-fern or the common rock fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces clusters of small, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Asplenium divergens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy, adaptable nature.</p>
