                    <h1>Avena sativa var. aristata</h1>
<p>Avena sativa var. aristata, commonly known as the slender oat, is a variant of the common oat characterized by its elongated, slender leaves and reduced inflorescence.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of florets that are adapted for wind pollination. Its seeds are enclosed in achenes, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for soil stabilization and wildlife habitat.</p>
