<p>Acacia etbaica subsp.</p>
<p>australis, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in compact spikes, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
