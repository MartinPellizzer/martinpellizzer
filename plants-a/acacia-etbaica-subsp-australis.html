                        <h1>Acacia etbaica subsp. australis</h1>
<p>Acacia etbaica subsp.</p>
<p>australis, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in compact spikes, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia etbaica subsp.</p>
<p>australis is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, including countries such as Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in rocky soils and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in hot and dry climates, often growing in association with other drought-tolerant plant species. It is well adapted to the ecological conditions of its native range, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant is also occasionally found in southern Arabia, extending its distribution slightly beyond the Horn of Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia etbaica subsp.</p>
<p>australis was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization. It is commonly found in coastal and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been largely confined to specific horticultural and environmental restoration projects.</p>
