                        <h1>Acaena ovalis</h1>
<p>Acaena ovalis, commonly known as the oval thistle, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its spiny, bract-like leaves and small, pink or white flowers. The plant produces achene fruits that are surrounded by a persistent, woolly pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in dry, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Acaena ovalis is valued for its ecological role in supporting native insect populations and its historical use by MƒÅori for medicinal purposes.</p>
