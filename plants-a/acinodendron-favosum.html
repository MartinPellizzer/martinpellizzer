<p>Acinodendron favosum, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in a variety of colors, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are often velvety and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its colorful blooms.</p>
<p>Acinodendron favosum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron favosum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length and 2-4 cm in width.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, with a slightly hairy texture. The stem is slender, upright, and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color. It produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, blooming during the dry season, and is pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron favosum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, lowland forests and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also reported in parts of Madagascar and the island of Socotra.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron favosum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and degraded forests. The plant is often used for soil stabilization due to its extensive root system. It has also been introduced as an ornamental plant in some regions because of its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential varies depending on the local ecosystem and management practices.</p>
