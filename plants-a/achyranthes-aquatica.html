<p>Achyranthes aquatica, commonly known as water bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread extensively. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom from summer to autumn.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
