                <h1>Achillea sulphurea</h1>
<p>Achillea sulphurea, commonly known as golden yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are finely divided and gray-green in color, while its stems are upright and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sulphurea has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a gray-green color due to dense pubescence.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sulphurea is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and coastal areas. This plant is commonly found in countries like Spain, Italy, Morocco, and Turkey. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with Mediterranean scrublands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can also be found in some parts of the Middle East and the Canary Islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sulphurea was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade and landscape gardening practices.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates, particularly in the western United States. This plant has established itself in disturbed soils and open habitats, often along roadsides and in urban areas. Its introduction has led to its spread beyond cultivated gardens into natural ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions and is primarily valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>
