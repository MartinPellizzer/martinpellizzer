                    <h1>Amphidesmium blechnoides var. polycarpum</h1>
<p>Amphidesmium blechnoides var. polycarpum, commonly known as the Polycarpum fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, compact fern with a creeping rhizome and dense, lance-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures called sori on the underside. This variety is characterized by its ability to produce multiple sporangia, hence the name "polycarpum.".</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
