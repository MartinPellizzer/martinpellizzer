                    <h1>Atriplex sulcata</h1>
<p>Atriplex sulcata, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in saline and nutrient-poor soils. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are typically clustered in dense, terminal spikes.</p>
<p>Atriplex sulcata is often used in rehabilitation of degraded lands due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
