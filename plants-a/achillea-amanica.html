<p>Achillea amanica, commonly known as the lesser yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, grass-like leaves and flat, white or pale yellow flower clusters that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and dry grasslands. It is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flowers.</p>
<p>Achillea amanica is used in traditional medicine and is also valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea amanica has compound, fern-like leaves that are finely dissected, with a gray-green color and a hairy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, branched, and has a slightly rough texture, with a reddish-brown color when mature. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea amanica is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that includes parts of southern Europe, such as Spain, Italy, and France, as well as some regions in North Africa. This species thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, often growing on slopes and along roadsides. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The conservation status of Achillea amanica is currently listed as least concern by the IUCN, indicating that it is not under immediate threat of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea amanica is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in spring or by sowing seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost. This plant has a growth cycle that begins with new growth in spring, flowering in mid to late summer, and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
