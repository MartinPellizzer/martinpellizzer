                <h1>Abutilon exstipulare</h1>
<p>Abutilon exstipulare, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in summer. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and thrives in warm, humid environments.</p>
<p>Abutilon exstipulare is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and vibrant flowers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon exstipulare has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with some branching. Its flowers are pendulous, with a 5-lobed calyx and five petals, usually yellow or orange in color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon exstipulare is a flowering plant native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is now also distributed in parts of Oregon and Arizona, often growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry slopes. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Abutilon exstipulare is considered a species of concern in some regions, though its conservation status varies by location.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon exstipulare is a tropical shrub known for its ornamental value and relatively easy care.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method. The plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in temperatures above 60°F (15°C) and entering dormancy in cooler conditions.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
