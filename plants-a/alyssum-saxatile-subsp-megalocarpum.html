<p>Alyssum saxatile subsp.</p>
<p>megalocarpum, commonly known as the large-seeded alpine alyssum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more robust seeds compared to other members of the species.</p>
