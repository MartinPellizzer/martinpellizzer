                    <h1>Athyrium supranigrescens</h1>
<p>Athyrium supranigrescens, commonly known as the dark-leaved chain fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its elegant, pinnate fronds with a dark, almost blackish hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings.</p>
