                    <h1>Atriplex sorianoi</h1>
<p>Atriplex sorianoi, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often coated with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Atriplex sorianoi is adapted to saline soils and can tolerate extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it a hardy species in harsh environments.</p>
