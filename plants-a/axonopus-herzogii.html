                <h1>Axonopus herzogii</h1>
<p>Axonopus herzogii, commonly known as the dwarf carpetgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growths that spread rapidly through rhizomes, creating a thick carpet on the ground. The plant has narrow, flat leaves that are typically light green in color and can reach up to 10 centimeters in length. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance.</p>
<p>Axonopus herzogii is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
