<p>Amphicarpaea villosa, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves. The plant produces two types of inflorescences: one above ground and one below ground, a unique feature known as amphicarpism. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
