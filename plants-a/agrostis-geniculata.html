                    <h1>Agrostis geniculata</h1>
<p>Agrostis geniculata, commonly known as the bentgrass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of a waxy coating on its leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Agrostis geniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and as a component in native plant gardens.</p>
