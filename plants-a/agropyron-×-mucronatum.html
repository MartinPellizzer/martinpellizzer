<p>Agropyron × mucronatum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear颖果, which are adapted for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop in arid regions.</p>
