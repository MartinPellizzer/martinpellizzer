                <h1>Adenodolichos harmsianus</h1>
<p>Adenodolichos harmsianus, commonly known as the Harms' cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit, with trifoliate leaves and small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos harmsianus has compound, trifoliate leaves that are trifoliate in shape, with each leaflet being ovate and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green bark that becomes rough with age. The flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos harmsianus is primarily native to DR Congo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of the country, where it thrives in the humid and warm climate. The plant is commonly observed in the lowland and montane forest regions of DR Congo. It plays a role in the local ecosystem as both a food source and a habitat provider.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos harmsianus was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces.</p>
<p>It was originally native to the Indian subcontinent and was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The distribution of this species has expanded due to its adaptability to various soil types and climatic conditions. It is now commonly found in gardens and along roadsides in its introduced range.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a concern in some regions.</p>
