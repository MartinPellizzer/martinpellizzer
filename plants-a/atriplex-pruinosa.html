<p>Atriplex pruinosa, commonly known as Pruinose Saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor, saline soils.</p>
<p>Atriplex pruinosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
