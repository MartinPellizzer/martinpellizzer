                            <h1>Alsine Meyeri</h1>
<p>Meyer's sandparsley, scientifically known as Alsine meyeri, is a hardy flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It thrives in sandy and saline soils, often found in desert margins and coastal dunes. This low-growing plant is characterized by its small, rosette-like leaves and clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems. Its resilience to harsh conditions makes it a subject of interest for botanists and ecological researchers alike.</p>
