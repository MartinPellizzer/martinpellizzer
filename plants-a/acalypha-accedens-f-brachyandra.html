<p>Acalypha accedens f. brachyandra, commonly known as the short-stalked velvetleaf, is a variant of the velvetleaf plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas.</p>
