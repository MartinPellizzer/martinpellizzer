<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and their close relatives, characterized by their complex structures and photosynthetic capabilities. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species, often with showy flowers and diverse growth forms.</p>
<p>Its order is Asparagales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many familiar genera such as orchids, lilies, and asparagus. Its family is Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, which is one of the largest families of flowering plants, characterized by their intricate and often showy flowers.
