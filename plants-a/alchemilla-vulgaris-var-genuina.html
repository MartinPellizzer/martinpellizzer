                    <h1>Alchemilla vulgaris var. genuina</h1>
<p>Alchemilla vulgaris var. genuina, commonly known as the common lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
