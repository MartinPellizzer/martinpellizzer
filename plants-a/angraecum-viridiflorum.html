                    <h1>Angraecum viridiflorum</h1>
<p>Angraecum viridiflorum, commonly known as the Emerald Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant greenish-white flowers, which are unusually shaped and often resemble a spiral. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by specific moths, showcasing a unique co-evolutionary relationship.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region.</p>
