                <h1>Acranthera megaphylla</h1>
<p>Acranthera megaphylla, commonly known as the large-leafed acranthera, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant features large, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Acranthera megaphylla is known for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera megaphylla has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a waxy green color and a moderate size, typically around 10-15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a straight, upright pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and a sweet fragrance, blooming during the spring months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera megaphylla is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly associated with primary and secondary lowland rainforest habitats. The plant is known for its large, showy leaves and is often seen growing near the forest floor.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within Borneo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera megaphylla was mainly introduced to the regions of South Australia and Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils within coastal dunes and heathlands. The plant is known for its large, showy white flowers that bloom during the winter months. It has been recorded in several conservation reserves and is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
<p>Its introduction to these areas has been documented through botanical surveys and ecological studies.</p>
