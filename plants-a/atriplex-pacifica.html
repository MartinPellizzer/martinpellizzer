<p>Atriplex pacifica, commonly known as Pacific saltbush, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its salt tolerance allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it an important species in coastal and desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Atriplex pacifica also plays a role in preventing soil erosion due to its extensive root system.</p>
