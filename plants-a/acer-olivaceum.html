                <h1>Acer olivaceum</h1>
<p>Acer olivaceum, commonly known as the olive maple, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive leaves, which are ovate to elliptic with a finely serrated margin. The leaves are typically a glossy green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer olivaceum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree with a spreading crown. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the tree and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer olivaceum is a small deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas, specifically found in countries like India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southern China and northern Vietnam, where it grows in moist, temperate climates. It thrives in mountainous environments, often in mixed forests with other broadleaf trees. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer olivaceum is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer olivaceum is a small deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seed propagation being the most common method. The growth cycle of Acer olivaceum includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with companion plants like lavender or sedum.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer olivaceum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and promoting the growth of other native plants. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer olivaceum contributes to carbon sequestration and offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for a range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer olivaceum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and flowers can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal practices, it has been utilized for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and provides habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is admired for its aesthetic appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its visual beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer olivaceum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Atrosanguineum' and 'Variegatum', which are known for their striking foliage colors. Hybrid forms often result from crosses with other maple species, enhancing traits like hardiness and leaf coloration. These cultivars and hybrids play a significant role in horticulture, especially in gardens and landscapes where visual interest is desired.</p>
<p>Their unique characteristics make them important additions to the maple family in cultivation.</p>
