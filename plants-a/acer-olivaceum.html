                <h1>Acer olivaceum</h1>
<p>Acer olivaceum, commonly known as the olive maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which aid in its dispersal. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Acer olivaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer olivaceum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod, which disperses by wind, allowing the seeds to travel several meters from the parent plant.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer olivaceum is a small deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas, primarily found in countries such as Bhutan, India, and Nepal.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Southeast Asia, where it has been introduced in some regions. This species thrives in moist, temperate forests and mountainous areas, often growing in shaded environments. It is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer olivaceum is considered to be of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer olivaceum is a slow-growing, deciduous tree known for its unique olive-green leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a dormant period in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions, and companion planting with flowering shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer olivaceum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its flowers and supports biodiversity in forest ecosystems. The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing overall ecological stability. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for land restoration.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer olivaceum is a species of maple native to East Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been traditionally used in some local medicinal practices for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. The tree's wood is relatively hard and has been used in small-scale woodworking and craftsmanship. Culturally, it holds symbolic meaning in certain regions, often associated with resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Due to its limited commercial use, Acer olivaceum primarily contributes to biodiversity and habitat support in its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer olivaceum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aconitifolium' and 'Atrosanguineum', known for their striking foliage colors. Hybrids have been developed to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and leaf coloration. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>
<p>They are widely cultivated in temperate regions for their seasonal beauty.</p>
