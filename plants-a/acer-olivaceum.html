<p>Acer olivaceum, commonly known as the olive maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which aid in its dispersal. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Acer olivaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>
