                <h1>Aegopodium simplex</h1>
<p>Aegopodium simplex, commonly known as bishop's weed, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its roots and leaves contain compounds such as apiol and limonene, which have been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>It is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can sometimes be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegopodium simplex has alternate, trifoliate leaves that are kidney-shaped with a hairy surface, typically measuring 2–6 cm in length, and are usually a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, erect, and have a slightly hairy texture, with a pale green to light brown color, growing in a spreading habit. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels, and bloom from late spring to early summer, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, dispersed by wind due to its small size and hairy surface.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>
