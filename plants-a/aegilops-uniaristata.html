                <h1>Aegilops uniaristata</h1>
<p>Aegilops uniaristata, commonly known as the single-awned goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with a single awn on each lemma, giving it its common name. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Aegilops uniaristata is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops uniaristata has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a slightly rough bark and grows upright with a bushy appearance. The plant produces small, pale green flowers in spikes, which bloom in early summer and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, dark seeds through mechanical means when the capsule dries and splits open.</p>
<p>Its root system consists of a fibrous network that helps it anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
