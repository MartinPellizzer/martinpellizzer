<p>Aegilops uniaristata, commonly known as the single-awned goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with a single awn on each lemma, giving it its common name. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Aegilops uniaristata is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
