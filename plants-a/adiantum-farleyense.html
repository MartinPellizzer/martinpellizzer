                <h1>Adiantum farleyense</h1>
<p>Adiantum farleyense, commonly known as the Farley's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that resemble the shape of a maidenhair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a finely divided structure, with a distinctive rachis that is slightly hairy.</p>
<p>Adiantum farleyense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum farleyense has delicate, finely divided leaves that are pinnate in structure, with a light green color and a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and they are relatively small, measuring about 10-20 cm in length. The plant has a slender, creeping stem with a smooth, pale green bark that grows along the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum farleyense is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing along riverbanks or in dense forests. Its distribution is closely associated with regions that have a warm and humid climate throughout the year.</p>
<p>Adiantum farleyense is also occasionally reported in parts of the Caribbean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum farleyense was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical climates. This plant is often found in association with other epiphytic and fern species, growing on rocks or trees. Its introduction has been documented in several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental plant.</p>
