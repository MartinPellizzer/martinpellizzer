<p>Abies californica, commonly known as the California white fir, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features a conical shape with long, needle-like leaves that are blue-green in color. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds surrounded by a papery wing. Its bark is thick, scaly, and dark gray, providing protection against fire and drought.</p>
<p>The California white fir is often found in mixed-conifer forests at elevations between 1,000 and 7,000 feet.</p>
