<p>Aspidium lancastriense, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a light green to grayish-green coloration. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams, wetlands, and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats.</p>
