                    <h1>Abies × vilmorinii</h1>
<p>Abies × vilmorinii, commonly known as the Vilmorin fir, is a natural hybrid between Abies balsamifera and Abies lasiocarpa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its conical shape and dense foliage, with needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The tree produces cones that are often shorter than those of its parent species, and it is typically found in high-altitude regions of the western United States. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic bridge between two closely related fir species.</p>
