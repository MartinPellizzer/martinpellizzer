<p>Adromischus aveolatus, commonly known as the "Pebble Plant," is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
