                    <h1>Artemisia ursorum</h1>
<p>Artemisia ursorum, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which bloom in late summer. Artemisia ursorum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiparasitic and digestive properties.</p>
<p>Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone, which contribute to its distinctive aroma and medicinal uses.</p>
