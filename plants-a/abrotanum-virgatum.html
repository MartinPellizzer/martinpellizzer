                <h1>Abrotanum virgatum</h1>
<p>Abrotanum virgatum, commonly known as Virginia tea.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to North America, particularly the eastern United States. The plant features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abrotanum virgatum has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, typically with a grayish-green or greenish-blue color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense, branched inflorescences, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant establish quickly in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrotanum virgatum is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, and southern France.</p>
<p>It is now found in parts of North Africa and the Canary Islands as well. This species thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and coastal areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to about 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Abrotanum virgatum is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though its populations may be vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abrotanum virgatum is a hardy annual plant commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, known for its small yellow flowers and aromatic leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds sown in early spring or by transplanting seedlings, which germinate quickly under warm conditions. The growth cycle of abrotanum virgatum begins with germination in spring, followed by rapid growth throughout the summer, culminating in flowering and seed production by late summer or early fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, as overwatering can lead to root rot. Fertilization is not typically required, but light feeding may promote growth, while pruning is rarely necessary. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, and it is generally resistant to most diseases.</p>
