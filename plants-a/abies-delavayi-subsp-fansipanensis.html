<p>Abies delavayi subsp.</p>
<p>fansipanensis, commonly known as the Fansipan fir, is a rare and endemic coniferous tree native to the high-altitude regions of Vietnam. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>The tree typically grows in cool, moist environments at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its cones are small and usually hang downward, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
