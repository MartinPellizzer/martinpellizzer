<p>Aphanostylis flavidiflora, commonly known as the yellow-flowered tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
