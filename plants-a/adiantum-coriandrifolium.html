<p>Adiantum coriandrifolium, commonly known as the water parsley fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often glossy and have a finely divided, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in wet conditions.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, parsley-like scent when crushed.</p>
