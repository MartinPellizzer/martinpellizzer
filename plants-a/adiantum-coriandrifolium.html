                <h1>Adiantum coriandrifolium</h1>
<p>Adiantum coriandrifolium, commonly known as the water parsley fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often glossy and have a finely divided, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in wet conditions.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, parsley-like scent when crushed.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum coriandrifolium has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with finely divided, thread-like pinnae arranged in a bipinnate pattern, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green, with a pale underside, and they are borne on long, slender, arching stems that grow from a rhizome. The stems are smooth and slender, with a light brown bark that is not particularly textured. Adiantum coriandrifolium produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures rather than true flowers, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The plant has a fibrous root system that helps anchor it to moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum coriandrifolium is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as India, China, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments like forests and mountainous areas. This fern thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing on rocky surfaces or along stream banks. Its native range extends to parts of Australia and New Guinea as well.</p>
<p>It is a hardy plant that adapts well to humid, temperate conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum coriandrifolium was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and stream banks. This fern has become naturalized in many regions where it thrives in cool, humid climates. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it is found.</p>
