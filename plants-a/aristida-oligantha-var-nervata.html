                    <h1>Aristida oligantha var. nervata</h1>
<p>Aristida oligantha var. nervata, commonly known as the narrow-veined threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and sandy soils, preferring well-drained conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of bracteate, spikelets that are tightly pressed against the stem.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its fine, thread-like lemma hairs, which are more pronounced in this variant compared to the typical form.</p>
