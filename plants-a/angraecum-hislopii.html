<p>Angraecum hislopii, commonly known as the star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces nectar-rich flowers that attract specific nocturnal pollinators, such as moths. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by the giant hawkmoth, which has a long proboscis.</p>
<p>Angraecum hislopii is valued for its beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
