<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the short growing season in its alpine habitat. Acrospira laurentii thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
