                <h1>Achoriphragma albidum</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma albidum, commonly known as the white sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Achoriphragma albidum is adapted to survive in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma albidum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green color, typically measuring around 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's environment for efficient nutrient uptake.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma albidum is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils and rocky outcrops, thriving in environments with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and is often seen growing along the edges of dunes or in open grasslands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is also occasionally cultivated in xerophytic gardens and landscaping projects.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma albidum was mainly introduced to control erosion and for ornamental purposes in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy and loamy soils, often in agricultural areas and along roadsides. The plant spreads through its rhizomes and seeds, which can be dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become invasive in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major threat in its introduced range compared to other invasive species.</p>
