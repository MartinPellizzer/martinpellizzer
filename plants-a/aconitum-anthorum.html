                <h1>Aconitum anthorum</h1>
<p>Aconitum anthorum, commonly known as the European monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem with large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply cut. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Aconitum anthorum contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle or ingest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum anthorum has leaves that are palmately compound, with 5-11 leaflets that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, dark green in color, and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and has a bluish-green color, growing in a clumping habit. The flowers are blue to purple, with a spurred petal, and are arranged in racemes; they bloom from July to August and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are small, winged, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant to store nutrients and survive in its alpine habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum anthorum is primarily native to temperate regions of Europe, including the British Isles, Scandinavia, and parts of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands, heaths, and damp meadows. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soil and moderate temperatures. It is particularly associated with calcareous soils and can often be found growing in association with other woodland flora.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the northern hemisphere, with no natural presence in the southern continents.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum anthorum was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly in the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It was often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its striking blue or purple flowers. The plant has since spread to various regions, including parts of the United States and Canada. It is now considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and minimize its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
