<p>Acacia triacantha, commonly known as the spiny acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorned stems and bipinnate leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in cylindrical spikes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and forage.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various desert animals.</p>
