<p>Anomospermum chloranthum subsp.</p>
<p>asplundii, commonly known as the Asplund's ghost tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the arid regions of Namibia. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its unique, gnarled trunk and sparse, leathery foliage.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by clustered, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, woody structure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment.</p>
