                <h1>Acer laurinum subsp. decandrum</h1>
<p>Acer laurinum subsp.</p>
<p>decandrum, commonly known as the nine-lobed maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which typically have nine to eleven lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras in the autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer laurinum subsp.</p>
<p>decandrum has elliptical to ovate leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring 5â€“8 cm in length. The stems are slender and twining, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer laurinum subsp.</p>
<p>decandrum is a rare and lesser-known variant of the maple family native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America and Europe, where it is cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in cool, humid climates and is typically found in mixed forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and limited natural population, it is considered endangered or critically endangered in its native range.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique plant in both its natural and cultivated environments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer laurinum subsp.</p>
<p>decandrum is a compact, slow-growing shrub known for its dense foliage and ornamental value. It can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings in summer or by layering, which ensures genetic consistency. The growth cycle of this plant is relatively slow, with new growth appearing in spring and maintaining a steady development throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with aromatic herbs like lavender or sage can help repel pests and improve the garden's overall health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer laurinum subsp.</p>
<p>decandrum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in woodland ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting a diverse range of insects and microorganisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer laurinum subsp.</p>
<p>decandrum is a lesser-known member of the maple family with limited direct culinary use but valued in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and compact growth. It has been traditionally used in some regions for its bark and leaves in herbal remedies, though its medicinal applications are not well-documented.</p>
<p>The plant contributes to local biodiversity and serves as a habitat for various insects and birds, supporting ecological balance. Culturally, it is sometimes symbolized in regional art and folklore, reflecting its presence in natural landscapes.</p>
<p>While not widely used in industry, it holds ecological and aesthetic value in forest ecosystems and urban green spaces.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer laurinum subsp.</p>
<p>decandrum has a variety of cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Crimson King' and 'Eternal Flame,' which are known for their striking autumn color. It also has several hybrids with other maple species, such as *Acer x antioquianum*, which enhances its adaptability and aesthetic appeal in gardens.</p>
<p>These cultivars and hybrids are prized for their compact growth, vibrant foliage, and ability to thrive in a range of climates. Their horticultural importance lies in their use as landscape trees and ornamental shrubs.</p>
<p>They are particularly popular in colder regions due to their hardiness and visual impact during the fall season.</p>
