                    <h1>Arenaria racemosa</h1>
<p>Arenaria racemosa, commonly known as sand pink, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in the summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a low-growing habit with dense, mat-forming foliage that helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Arenaria racemosa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
