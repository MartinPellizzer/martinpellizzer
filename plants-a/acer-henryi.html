                <h1>Acer henryi</h1>
<p>Acer henryi, commonly known as the Henry maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. It typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer henryi has palmately compound leaves that are usually 5–9 lobes, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer henryi is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and scattered, with populations becoming increasingly isolated. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes, often growing in shaded understory conditions. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acer henryi is currently listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer henryi is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The growth cycle of Acer henryi includes a dormant period in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer henryi is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for land restoration projects.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer henryi contributes to carbon sequestration and offers aesthetic value in natural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer henryi is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial contexts, its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and decorative crafts. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in traditional Chinese horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer henryi plays a role in both environmental conservation and aesthetic appreciation in gardens and natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
