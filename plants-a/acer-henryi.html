<p>Acer henryi, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ornamental foliage, which turns vibrant shades of red and yellow in the autumn. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Acer henryi is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated for its seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer henryi has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer henryi is a deciduous tree native to western China, specifically found in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tibet.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of northern Vietnam and southeastern Asia, though it remains most prevalent in its native range. It thrives in temperate environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soils within mountainous regions. Acer henryi is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer henryi is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer henryi includes a dormant phase in winter, active growth in spring, and a period of leaf drop in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and annual pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with plants like ferns or heathers in a garden setting.</p>
