                <h1>Actinophloeus punctulatus</h1>
<p>Actinophloeus punctulatus, commonly known as the spotted leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often marked with distinctive brown or black spots. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually pinnate, with a soft, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Actinophloeus punctulatus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus punctulatus has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green in color, with a tubular structure and five lobes, blooming during the summer months and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus punctulatus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland forests and swampy areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with wetland ecosystems. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Papua New Guinea and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat is characterized by rich, organic soils and a warm, moist environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus punctulatus was mainly introduced to control invasive weeds in agricultural and pastoral areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in New Zealand and parts of Australia for its ability to suppress plant growth. The plant is typically applied as a foliar spray to target broadleaf weeds. It is important to note that it is not effective against grasses or certain resilient weed species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific mode of action, it is often used in integrated weed management strategies.</p>
