<p>Alsophila gigantea, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a striking member of the Cyatheaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a large, feathery frond crown that can reach impressive heights. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, meaning they have a complex, feather-like structure with multiple subdivisions.</p>
<p>Alsophila gigantea thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along coastal areas.</p>
