                <h1>Adiantum pentadactylon</h1>
<p>Adiantum pentadactylon, commonly known as the five-finger fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into five pairs of pinnae, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a finely divided structure, which helps in efficient light absorption.</p>
<p>Adiantum pentadactylon is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid environment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum pentadactylon has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a delicate, lace-like appearance and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright with a smooth, light green bark. This plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, appearing in early spring. The fruit is a dry, capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pentadactylon is primarily native to Brazil South and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in the humid forests and shaded areas of these regions. It thrives in warm, moist environments with high levels of humidity. The plant is often associated with tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific areas within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pentadactylon was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in woodland habitats.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical zones. This plant is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides or abandoned lots due to its adaptability. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Careful management is needed to prevent its spread in ecosystems where it may outcompete native vegetation.</p>
