                    <h1>Anemone glacialis</h1>
<p>Anemone glacialis, commonly known as the glacier anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It has slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, forming a dense mat. Its leaves are basal, heart-shaped, and covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Anemone glacialis thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions.</p>
