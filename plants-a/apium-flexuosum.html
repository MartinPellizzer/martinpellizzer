<p>Apium flexuosum, commonly known as the broad-leaved celery or wild celery, is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves and slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are usually fibrous and not as developed as in cultivated celery varieties.</p>
<p>Apium flexuosum is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides.</p>
