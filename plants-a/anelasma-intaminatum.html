                    <h1>Anelasma intaminatum</h1>
<p>Anelasma intaminatum, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing microscopic prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually short and whorled, and it lacks true roots, instead relying on rhizoids for anchorage.</p>
<p>Anelasma intaminatum plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems but is notable for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor water conditions.</p>
