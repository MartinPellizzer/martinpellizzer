<p>Abolboda imberbis, commonly known as the smooth-leaved euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and smooth, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care.</p>
