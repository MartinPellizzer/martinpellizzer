                <h1>Acrostichum tenue</h1>
<p>Acrostichum tenue, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum tenue is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tenue has long, narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a creeping or spreading pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers with no distinct petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively along the ground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tenue is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, wetlands, and mangrove swamps where it thrives in saline or brackish water conditions. This plant is also present in some Caribbean islands and along the Atlantic coast of North America. It is well adapted to humid climates and can tolerate periodic flooding.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to its ability to grow in coastal and estuarine environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tenue was mainly introduced to coastal and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with high salinity and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and salt marshes. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its strong root system. It has been introduced to several regions with similar ecological conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited to tropical and subtropical coastal zones.</p>
