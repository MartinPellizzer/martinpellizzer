                    <h1>Ananas microstachys var. nanus</h1>
<p>Ananas microstachys var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf pineapple plant, is a compact bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, waxy, blue-green leaves that form a central cup to hold water. The plant produces a small, edible fruit similar to the common pineapple but on a much smaller scale. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
