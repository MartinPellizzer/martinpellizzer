                    <h1>Athyrium × kawabataeoides</h1>
<p>Athyrium × kawabataeoides, commonly known as the Kawabataeoides fern, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium niponicum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a graceful, arching growth habit. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a refined, shade-tolerant foliage plant.</p>
