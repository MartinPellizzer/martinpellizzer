                <h1>Adeneleuterophora poiformis</h1>
<p>Adeneleuterophora poiformis, commonly known as the smoothleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that bear small, alternate leaves. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters, which are often subtended by bracts.</p>
<p>It is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adeneleuterophora poiformis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adeneleuterophora poiformis is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and swampy areas where the climate is humid and warm. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adeneleuterophora poiformis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and abandoned lots.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with ample sunlight and moderate moisture levels. This plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate various soil conditions make it a successful invader in new regions.</p>
<p>However, it can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns in some areas.</p>
