                    <h1>Arenaria</h1>
<p>Arenaria, commonly known as sandspurs, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or arid regions. They are characterized by their low-growing habit, with small, often hairy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. Many species produce capsules that release seeds with hooked bristles, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Arenaria species are generally hardy and can thrive in poor soil conditions, making them common in disturbed or dry habitats.</p>
