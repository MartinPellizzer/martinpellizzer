                    <h1>Aegilops triuncialis var. leptostachys</h1>
<p>Aegilops triuncialis var. leptostachys, commonly known as the slender-stalked wild wheat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
