<p>Arabis hirsuta var. collisparsa, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with hairy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in suitable climates.</p>
