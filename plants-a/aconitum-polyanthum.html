                    <h1>Aconitum polyanthum</h1>
<p>Aconitum polyanthum, commonly known as the Chinese aconite or the many-flowered aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system and upright, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of showy, blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are arranged in complex, spire-like inflorescences. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a rough, hairy texture, typical of the genus Aconitum.</p>
<p>Aconitum polyanthum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>
