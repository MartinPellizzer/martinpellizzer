                <h1>Aconitum polyanthum</h1>
<p>Aconitum polyanthum, commonly known as the Chinese aconite or the many-flowered aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system and upright, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of showy, blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are arranged in complex, spire-like inflorescences. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a rough, hairy texture, typical of the genus Aconitum.</p>
<p>Aconitum polyanthum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum polyanthum has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically reaching up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a straight, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are showy, blue-violet in color, arranged in dense spires, and consist of five petals with a spurred lower petal; they bloom in late summer to early autumn and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted for absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum polyanthum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. This plant is commonly associated with high-altitude meadows and grasslands, where it benefits from the cool, moist climate. It is also occasionally found in the western Himalayas, extending into parts of northern India and Nepal.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum polyanthum was mainly introduced to gardens and naturalized areas in temperate regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its striking blue or violet flowers and is valued as an ornamental plant. However, it can become invasive in certain environments, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is not recommended for use in areas where children or pets are present.</p>
