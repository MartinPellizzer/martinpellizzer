<p>Aristida dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and the presence of two branches at each node, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, adapted to conserve water in dry environments.</p>
<p>Aristida dichotoma is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
