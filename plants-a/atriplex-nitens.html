<p>Atriplex nitens, commonly known as the silverleaf shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, salt-excreting glands, aiding in its adaptation to saline soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, allowing it to store water efficiently in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Atriplex nitens is often found in desert scrub and coastal habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
