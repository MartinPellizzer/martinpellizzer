                    <h1>Apocynum hypericifolium f. arenarium</h1>
<p>Apocynum hypericifolium f. arenarium, commonly known as the sand-leaf dogbane, is a variant of the dogbane plant native to arid and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stem is often covered in a white, waxy coating, which further aids in reducing water evaporation.</p>
<p>This form is particularly resilient, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
