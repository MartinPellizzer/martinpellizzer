                <h1>Acinodendron stylosum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron stylosum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow and are clustered in small umbels.</p>
<p>It is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron stylosum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green, consisting of five petals and stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron stylosum is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the undergrowth of these dense forests. The plant is commonly found in lowland and hill forest regions, often growing along stream banks and in moist, nutrient-rich soil. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to the biodiversity of the forest floor.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron stylosum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, water, and animals. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in several countries where it has established itself outside its native range.</p>
