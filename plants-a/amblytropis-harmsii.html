                    <h1>Amblytropis harmsii</h1>
<p>Amblytropis harmsii, commonly known as the Harms' ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with slender, often hairless stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amblytropis harmsii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
