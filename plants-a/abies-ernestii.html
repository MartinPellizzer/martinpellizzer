<p>Abies ernestii, commonly known as the Ernestii fir, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds enclosed in a thin, winged aril. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found at high elevations where it contributes to the biodiversity of temperate forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, the Ernestii fir is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
