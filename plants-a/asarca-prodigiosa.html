                    <h1>Asarca prodigiosa</h1>
<p>Asarca prodigiosa, commonly known as the prodigal lichen, is a unique organism that belongs to the Ascomycota division.</p>
<p>It is a composite organism composed of a fungal partner and a green alga or cyanobacterium, forming a mutualistic relationship. This lichen typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in harsh conditions. Its structure consists of a thallus, which is a vegetative body formed by the fungal hyphae and the photosynthetic partner.</p>
<p>Asarca prodigiosa is notable for its ability to survive extreme environmental stress due to its symbiotic nature.</p>
