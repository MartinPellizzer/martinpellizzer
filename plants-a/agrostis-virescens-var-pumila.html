                    <h1>Agrostis virescens var. pumila</h1>
<p>Agrostis virescens var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf meadowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and ability to form attractive ground covers.</p>
