<p>Asplenium anceps var. proliferum, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern with a rosette-like growth habit, featuring delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks, walls, or in damp soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, making it a common sight in woodland settings.</p>
