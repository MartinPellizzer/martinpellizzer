                <h1>Acrostichum sprucei</h1>
<p>Acrostichum sprucei, commonly known as the dwarf chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a rhizomatous growth system, with fronds that are typically narrow and strap-like. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum sprucei has large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically broad and dark green, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark. This plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, round drupe that contains a single seed, which is dispersed by wind due to its light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum sprucei is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove swamps and estuaries. This plant thrives in brackish water conditions and is often associated with saltwater environments. It is also present in some areas of Florida and along the Gulf Coast of the United States.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to tropical and subtropical coastal zones where it can tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum sprucei was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and estuarine environments. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its strong root system and ability to stabilize shorelines. Its introduction has also been associated with ornamental horticulture in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in certain areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
