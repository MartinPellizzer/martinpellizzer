                    <h1>Arenaria vestita</h1>
<p>Arenaria vestita, commonly known as the silver sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found in rocky soils and tundra habitats. The plant features dense, silver-white foliage that helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its extreme environment. Its small, pink or white flowers bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise muted appearance.</p>
<p>Arenaria vestita plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
