<p>Acacia redacta, commonly known as the red acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in pod-like structures that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Acacia redacta is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates.</p>
