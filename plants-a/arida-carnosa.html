<p>Arida carnosa, commonly known as the desert carnation, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers during the rainy season. Its stems are often branched and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Arida carnosa is well adapted to extreme heat and low precipitation, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
