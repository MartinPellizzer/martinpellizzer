<p>Aubertia glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that often exude a sticky substance. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive success in arid environments.</p>
<p>Aubertia glandulosa is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
