                    <h1>Alliaria richii</h1>
<p>Alliaria richii, commonly known as winter garlic or garlic mustard, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its pungent odor due to sulfur-containing compounds. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with alternate, heart-shaped leaves and small white or pale purple flowers.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread quickly in disturbed soils, often becoming an invasive species in new environments.</p>
