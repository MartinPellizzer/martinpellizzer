<p>Acrocephalus heudelotii, commonly known as the yellow marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, fens, and other moist environments, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wet soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
