                <h1>Acinodendron affine</h1>
<p>Acinodendron affine, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, often dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron affine has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron affine is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with well-drained soils, often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with the coastal and inland forests of East Africa. It plays an important ecological role in these habitats by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron affine was mainly introduced to the Greater Mekong region of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for landscaping. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in wetland and riparian habitats. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its rapid vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now focusing on controlling its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
