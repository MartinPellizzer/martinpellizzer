                <h1>Aconitum hispidum</h1>
<p>Aconitum hispidum, commonly known as the hairy monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture, and it produces toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle. Aconitum hispidum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value despite its poisonous nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum hispidum has leaves that are compound, typically with three to five leaflets, arranged alternately along the stem, and are usually lance-shaped or ovate, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a rough, hairy texture and a dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spikes, and have five petal-like sepals and showy, spurred petals, blooming in summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum hispidum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, including countries such as Austria, Germany, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky soils and open slopes at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. This species is commonly associated with meadows, forest edges, and grasslands in these regions. It is well adapted to cool, moist climates and is often found in areas with high biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is sometimes referred to as "monkshood" or "wolfsbane.".</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum hispidum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes have contributed to its establishment in non-native environments. However, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native flora and altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to manage its spread and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
