<p>Actinodaphne philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne philippinensis has simple, alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a smooth margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a spreading crown.

The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns dark purple when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne philippinensis is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is found in various parts of the archipelago, particularly in the northern and central regions. This plant thrives in lowland to mid-elevation forests, often in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed areas within its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific islands where the ecological conditions match its requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne philippinensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates and is often cultivated for its aromatic leaves and ornamental value. The plant is commonly found in gardens and as a landscape plant in regions where it has been introduced. It is valued for its ability to tolerate a range of soil types and its resilience to moderate environmental conditions.</p>
<p>However, its introduction to new regions can sometimes lead to ecological impacts if it becomes invasive.</p>
