<p>Aechmea gigas, commonly known as the giant bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's foliage is typically dark green with a metallic sheen, and it can grow up to several meters in height. Aechmea gigas produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the center of the rosette, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.</p>
<p>Its unique structure and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea gigas has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, sword-like, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a waxy, dark green surface and a striking red underside.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a typical stem, instead having a short, stout base with a thick, fibrous bark that is reddish-brown in color.

The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its native habitat, often in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
