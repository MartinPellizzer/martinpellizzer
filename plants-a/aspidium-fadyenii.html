<p>Aspidium fadyenii, commonly known as the Fadyen's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes spread across the water surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Aspidium fadyenii plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing excess nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
