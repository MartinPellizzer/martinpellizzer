<p>Atriplex spinifera, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are adapted to retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing soils in saline or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Atriplex spinifera is also used in traditional medicine and as forage for wildlife and livestock.</p>
