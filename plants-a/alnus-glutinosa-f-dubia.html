                    <h1>Alnus glutinosa f. dubia</h1>
<p>Alnus glutinosa f. dubia, commonly known as the sticky alder or black alder, is a variant of the black alder tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and small, oval leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are wind-pollinated, and it is often found in wet or swampy areas due to its tolerance for waterlogged soils. Alnus glutinosa f. dubia is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, making it valuable in soil enrichment.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
