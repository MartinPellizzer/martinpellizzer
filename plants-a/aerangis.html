                    <h1>Aerangis</h1>
<p>Aerangis, commonly known as the orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae), which includes over 25,000 species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, often showy flowers with three petals and two modified sepals. The plant typically has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in various environmental conditions. Aerangis species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks rather than in soil.</p>
<p>These plants are widely cultivated for their ornamental value and are found in diverse habitats across tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
