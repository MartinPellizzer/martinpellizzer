                <h1>Adenanthos argyreus</h1>
<p>Adenanthos argyreus, commonly known as the silver malleeflower, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and is often found in mallee woodlands.</p>
<p>Adenanthos argyreus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos argyreus has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slightly woody, with a pale green to greyish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense spikes, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos argyreus is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the area around the Fitzgerald River National Park. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and near-coastal environments. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters.</p>
<p>Adenanthos argyreus is a rare and threatened species, with a limited distribution within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos argyreus was mainly introduced to South Australia and southern New South Wales as an ornamental plant due to its striking silver foliage and showy flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides where it thrives in well-drained soils. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. The plant is particularly adapted to dry conditions, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, its spread can pose a threat to native flora in regions where it is not native.</p>
