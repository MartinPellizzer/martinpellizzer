<p>Aegilops ovata subsp.</p>
<p>gibberosa, commonly known as the woolly wild oat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and hairy, oval-shaped spikelets.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential as a forage crop and its genetic relationship to wheat.</p>
