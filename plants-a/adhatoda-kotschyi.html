                <h1>Adhatoda kotschyi</h1>
<p>Adhatoda kotschyi, commonly known as the African skullcap, is a perennial shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in whorled clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional African medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda kotschyi has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white to pale pink petals, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda kotschyi is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly in regions of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, often growing in open woodland, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, including Myanmar and Thailand.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda kotschyi was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has established itself in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, disturbed areas such as riverbanks and roadside vegetation. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional medicine for various ailments. Its introduction may have occurred through human activities, such as the movement of plants for ornamental or medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
