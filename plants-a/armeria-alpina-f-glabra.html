                    <h1>Armeria alpina f. glabra</h1>
<p>Armeria alpina f. glabra, commonly known as the glabrous alpine thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>The glabrous (hairless) foliage of this variety distinguishes it from other forms of Armeria alpina.</p>
