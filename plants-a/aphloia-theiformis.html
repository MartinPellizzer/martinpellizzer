                    <h1>Aphloia theiformis</h1>
<p>Aphloia theiformis, commonly known as the desert candle, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to its otherwise muted appearance. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Aphloia theiformis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
