                    <h1>Acacia farinosa</h1>
<p>Acacia farinosa, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and its distinctive, feathery leaves that are covered in a fine, whitish powder, giving it a dusty appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. Acacia farinosa is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a capacity to fix nitrogen, making it an important species in ecological restoration.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable example of desert flora.</p>
