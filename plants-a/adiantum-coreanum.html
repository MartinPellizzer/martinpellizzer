                <h1>Adiantum coreanum</h1>
<p>Adiantum coreanum, commonly known as the Korean maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Adiantum coreanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum coreanum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, with a finely divided structure, and they vary in size from 20 to 40 cm in length. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a simple, unbranched pattern. This plant does not produce showy flowers; instead, it has inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are located on the underside of the leaves, and it relies on wind pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and these are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to propagate without a fruit or seed dispersal mechanism.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum coreanum is primarily native to East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate regions, particularly in forested areas with moist, shaded environments. This fern thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often associated with mountainous habitats and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes used in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum coreanum was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas, often near streams or in woodland habitats. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both temperate and subtropical climates. Its ability to spread via spores allows it to colonize new areas rapidly.</p>
<p>However, in some regions, it has become invasive, outcompeting native species for resources.</p>
