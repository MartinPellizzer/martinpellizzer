                    <h1>Andromeda glandulosa var. ovalifolia</h1>
<p>Andromeda glandulosa var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved sweetfern, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in tiny, glandular dots. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its compact form and foliage, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens.</p>
