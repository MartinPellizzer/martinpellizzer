                    <h1>Agrostis bicuspidata</h1>
<p>Agrostis bicuspidata, commonly known as the two-awned bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and the presence of two awns on its seed heads, which are bristle-like structures aiding in seed dispersal. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Agrostis bicuspidata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in various environmental conditions.</p>
