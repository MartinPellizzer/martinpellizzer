                <h1>Adelobotrys macranthus</h1>
<p>Adelobotrys macranthus, commonly known as the large-flowered adelobotrys, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adelobotrys macranthus thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys macranthus has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green to reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring and pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys macranthus is primarily native to Peru.</p>
<p>It is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the departments of Arequipa, Cusco, and Puno. This plant typically grows in humid, mountainous environments at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. It is commonly found in cloud forests and secondary growth areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Peru's diverse landscape.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys macranthus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in roadsides, wastelands, and along the edges of forests. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive nature, it can outcompete native plants and alter local ecosystems.</p>
