                <h1>Adelobotrys macranthus</h1>
<p>Adelobotrys macranthus, commonly known as the large-flowered adelobotrys, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a smooth texture, and the stems are usually woody and branched.</p>
<p>Adelobotrys macranthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys macranthus has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are glossy green in color, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that has a slight ridged texture. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys macranthus is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, including countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these regions, its current distribution is limited due to habitat loss and fragmentation. It thrives in humid, shaded environments under the forest canopy, typically in lowland to mid-elevation areas. The plant is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Adelobotrys macranthus is listed as endangered due to deforestation and habitat degradation, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys macranthus is a striking flowering plant known for its vibrant, showy blooms and relatively easy care.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant follows a typical growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and entering a dormant phase in the winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry out slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning after blooming helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is relatively pest and disease-resistant but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
