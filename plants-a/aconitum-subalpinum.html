                <h1>Aconitum subalpinum</h1>
<p>Aconitum subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem. Aconitum subalpinum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>It is also known for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum subalpinum has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are dark green and velvety in texture, arranged alternately along the stem, with leaflets ranging from 1 to 3 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in racemes, blooming from July to August, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the moist, cool alpine environments where the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum subalpinum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, including countries such as Switzerland, Austria, Germany, and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky soils at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. This plant is commonly found in meadows, grasslands, and open slopes where the climate is cool and moist. It is well adapted to harsh mountain conditions and plays a role in the ecological diversity of these high-altitude habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum subalpinum was mainly introduced to temperate regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats, growing in rocky or gravelly soils. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its striking blue or purple flowers. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is adapted to cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to various regions outside its native range.</p>
