                <h1>Adina polycephaloides</h1>
<p>Adina polycephaloides, commonly known as the clustered adina, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense clusters of small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Adina polycephaloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina polycephaloides has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina polycephaloides is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and humid lowland areas. This species thrives in shaded undergrowth and is often associated with secondary growth forests. Its distribution extends to parts of New Guinea and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the warm, moist climate of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina polycephaloides was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a shrub native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. The plant was introduced as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists in New Zealand.</p>
