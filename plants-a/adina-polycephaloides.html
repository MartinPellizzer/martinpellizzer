                <h1>Adina polycephaloides</h1>
<p>Adina polycephaloides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense, aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape, with a glossy surface.</p>
<p>Adina polycephaloides is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been historically used in traditional crafts and as a source of incense.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina polycephaloides has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside, with a smooth upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanging as the plant matures. It produces small, clustered flowers with five pinkish-white petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are shallow and fibrous, helping it anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina polycephaloides is a rare shrub native to the island of Madagascar, where it is found in specific forested regions.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated areas within the eastern rainforests of the country. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Adina polycephaloides is listed as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adina polycephaloides is a versatile and resilient plant commonly grown for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Adina polycephaloides is relatively fast, with mature plants reaching full size within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry out slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to promote bushy growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adina polycephaloides is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and promoting the growth of other plants in the surrounding area.</p>
