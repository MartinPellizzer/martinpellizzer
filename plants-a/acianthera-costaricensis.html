                <h1>Acianthera costaricensis</h1>
<p>Acianthera costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican violet, is a species of orchid native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and pink. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. It is often found in cloud forests and is adapted to grow on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera costaricensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth texture and a light green color, growing upright and branching sparingly. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white to pale pink petals and a distinctive spurred structure, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera costaricensis is primarily native to Costa Rica and Panam√°.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical regions of these Central American countries. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests and lowland rainforests. The plant is adapted to the warm and moist climate of the region.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat is limited to specific areas within these two nations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera costaricensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries with humid climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests and understory habitats. The plant is often found in areas with rich organic soil and high humidity levels. It is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
