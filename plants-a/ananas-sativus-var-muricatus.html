                    <h1>Ananas sativus var. muricatus</h1>
<p>Ananas sativus var. muricatus, commonly known as the rough pineapple, is a variant of the pineapple plant characterized by its textured, spiky leaves and a more robust flavor profile compared to the typical pineapple.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-draining soil. The plant produces a fruit that is often smaller and more intensely flavored than the common pineapple, with a distinctive, rough exterior. Its cultivation is less widespread due to its demanding growth conditions and the challenges of its spiky foliage.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its unique culinary qualities.</p>
