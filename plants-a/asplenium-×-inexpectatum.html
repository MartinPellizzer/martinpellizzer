                    <h1>Asplenium × inexpectatum</h1>
<p>Asplenium × inexpectatum, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a rare and naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive shield-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
