<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This plant is commonly associated with the Atlantic Forest biome, where it plays a role in local ecosystems. Its natural habitat includes humid lowlands and mountainous regions with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Abutilon hastatum is also occasionally found in parts of Central America, extending its native range slightly into that region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon hastatum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
