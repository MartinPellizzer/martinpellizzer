                    <h1>Acacia courrantiana</h1>
<p>Acacia courrantiana, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves that are divided into numerous small leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds.</p>
<p>Acacia courrantiana is often used in coastal dune stabilization due to its hardy nature and ability to prevent erosion.</p>
