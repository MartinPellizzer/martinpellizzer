                        <h1>Acacia courrantiana</h1>
<p>Acacia courrantiana, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves that are divided into numerous small leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds.</p>
<p>Acacia courrantiana is often used in coastal dune stabilization due to its hardy nature and ability to prevent erosion.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia courrantiana is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland ecosystems. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate high temperatures. It is often seen growing in rocky outcrops and along riverbanks in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of water and well-drained soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia courrantiana was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This plant has been introduced to several parts of the world, including Australia, South America, and parts of Africa. It is often used for ornamental purposes due to its unique foliage and ability to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>However, in some regions, it has become an invasive species, outcompeting native plants.</p>
