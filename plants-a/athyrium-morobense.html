                    <h1>Athyrium morobense</h1>
<p>Athyrium morobense, commonly known as the Morobe holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Islands, particularly the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens.</p>
