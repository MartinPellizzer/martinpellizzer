                <h1>Aellenia iliensis</h1>
<p>Aellenia iliensis, commonly known as the Ili Valley bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Aellenia iliensis is noted for its compact stature and is often found in high-altitude meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aellenia iliensis has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth margin and a slightly tapered tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
