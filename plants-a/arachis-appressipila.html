<p>Arachis appressipila, commonly known as the Brazilian peanut or wild peanut, is a species of legume native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, with small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces underground pods containing oval-shaped seeds, which are similar to cultivated peanuts but often smaller. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is adapted to poor soils, making it a resilient species.</p>
<p>Arachis appressipila is also valued for its potential in agricultural research due to its genetic diversity and adaptability.</p>
