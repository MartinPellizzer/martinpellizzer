                <h1>Adinandra corneriana</h1>
<p>Adinandra corneriana, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant features elliptical, leathery leaves with a smooth upper surface and a slightly hairy underside. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are borne in clusters and are followed by small, round berries.</p>
<p>Adinandra corneriana is often found in lowland and hill forest areas, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra corneriana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra corneriana is primarily native to Malaya.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of Malaysia, particularly in the area known as Malaya. This plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is adapted to the humid and warm climate of the region. It is often found in secondary growth areas and along forest edges.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Malaya, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra corneriana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures, such as parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering patterns. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for horticultural purposes.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by specific environmental conditions and competition with native species.</p>
