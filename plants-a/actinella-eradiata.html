                <h1>Actinella eradiata</h1>
<p>Actinella eradiata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Proteaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella eradiata has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella eradiata is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically the coastal regions of North and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland and marsh environments, often found along the edges of freshwater ponds and slow-moving streams. This plant is well adapted to moist, sandy soils and is commonly associated with tidal and brackish habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella eradiata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a potential ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant spreads rapidly through its rhizomes, making it difficult to control.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its ecological impact.</p>
