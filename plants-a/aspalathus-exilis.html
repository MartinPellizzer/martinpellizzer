                    <h1>Aspalathus exilis</h1>
<p>Aspalathus exilis, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and requires a warm, Mediterranean climate. It is closely related to the more famous rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) but is less commonly cultivated.</p>
<p>The botanical interest in Aspalathus exilis lies in its unique morphology and potential for future horticultural or commercial use.</p>
