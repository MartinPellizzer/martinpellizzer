<p>Ayenia lobata, commonly known as the clustered greenbriar, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. Ayenia lobata thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological studies.</p>
