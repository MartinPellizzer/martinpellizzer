                <h1>Acer pinnatum</h1>
<p>Acer pinnatum, commonly known as the laceleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely dissected, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage makes it a striking addition to landscapes, especially in the spring and fall.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pinnatum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptical in shape, measuring up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, turning vibrant red or orange in the fall, adding to the tree's ornamental value. The stem is straight and slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a samara, with two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the tree's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pinnatum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of Central America, specifically found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to specific areas in southern Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical forests, often growing in shaded understory conditions. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer pinnatum is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pinnatum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and elegant form.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The growth cycle includes a dormant phase in winter, active growth in spring, and peak foliage in fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowers like lavender or conifers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and provide beneficial ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
