                <h1>Acer pinnatum</h1>
<p>Acer pinnatum, commonly known as the California maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely pinnate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and has a spreading, rounded crown.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pinnatum has leaves that are pinnately compound, with finely toothed leaflets that are typically 5-10 cm long, arranged alternately along the stem, and display a vibrant green during the growing season, turning red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub with a rounded crown. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, arranged in upright clusters, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pinnatum is a species of maple native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these regions. It thrives in moist, temperate environments such as riparian zones and mountain forests. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer pinnatum is listed as endangered in some areas, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pinnatum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most common and reliable method. The growth cycle of Acer pinnatum involves rapid growth in spring and early summer, followed by a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering during the growing season, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by aphids and powdery mildew, and it pairs well with plants like lavender and ornamental grasses in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pinnatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting biodiversity in the ecosystem. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil structure and promoting the growth of other plant species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer pinnatum contributes to carbon sequestration, offering long-term ecological benefits by mitigating climate change impacts.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pinnatum is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and various practical applications.</p>
<p>Its leaves are often used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions.

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pinnatum has a variety of cultivars and hybrids that are highly valued in horticulture for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Sutherlandii' and 'Aureum', which are known for their striking foliage colors and unique leaf shapes. Hybrids such as Acer pinnatum x Acer griseum have been developed to enhance traits like cold hardiness and autumn color. These varieties are important in landscape design due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Their cultivation contributes significantly to the diversity of maple trees in gardens and public spaces.</p>
