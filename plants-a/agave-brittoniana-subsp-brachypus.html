<p>Agave brittoniana subsp.</p>
<p>brachypus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color.</p>
<p>The leaves are relatively narrow and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, white to pale green flowers.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
