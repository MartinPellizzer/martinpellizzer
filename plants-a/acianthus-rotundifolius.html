                <h1>Acianthus rotundifolius</h1>
<p>Acianthus rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leafed acianthus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of broad, rounded leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is widely cultivated in subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthus rotundifolius has rounded, broad leaves that are clustered at the base of the plant, forming a rosette shape, with a waxy, dark green surface and a silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that grows upright from the ground. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthus rotundifolius is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the rainforests of these countries. This plant is commonly found in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soil. It is often associated with the understory vegetation of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthus rotundifolius was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become established in several regions of the country. Although it is not considered invasive, it has been found growing in coastal and forested areas. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments, typically along stream banks and in native forest understories.</p>
<p>Its distribution remains localized, with limited spread beyond its initial introduction sites.</p>
