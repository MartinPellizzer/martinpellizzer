                    <h1>Agalinis pedicularia var. ambigens</h1>
<p>Agalinis pedicularia var. ambigens, commonly known as the ambiguous stickseed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in open, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and prairies.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
