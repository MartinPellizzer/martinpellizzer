                    <h1>Acer pseudoplatanus f. heterophyllum</h1>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable maple, is a rare and distinctive variant of the European maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its highly variable leaf morphology, which can range from palmate to deeply lobed forms. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves often display a striking combination of green and red hues during the autumn season.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique genetic variability and potential for hybridization with other maple species.</p>
