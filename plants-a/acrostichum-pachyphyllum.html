                <h1>Acrostichum pachyphyllum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum pachyphyllum, commonly known as the thick-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often serrated fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near water sources. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to anchor itself in moist soil.</p>
<p>The thick, fleshy leaves help it retain moisture, making it well adapted to its tropical habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pachyphyllum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are elongated, dark green, and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a woody texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a globose drupe containing a single seed, dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in wet, swampy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pachyphyllum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests and swampy areas. This plant is commonly associated with mangrove ecosystems and coastal areas where it tolerates saline conditions. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of these habitats by providing shelter and food for various species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is also occasionally found in other parts of the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pachyphyllum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its large, glossy leaves. The plant has since spread into coastal and estuarine habitats. It is considered a potential threat to native vegetation in these areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now limited to the northern part of the country.</p>
