                    <h1>Acrostichum nummulariifolium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum nummulariifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, round, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid rainforests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
