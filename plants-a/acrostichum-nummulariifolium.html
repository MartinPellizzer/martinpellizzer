                <h1>Acrostichum nummulariifolium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum nummulariifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, round, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid rainforests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum nummulariifolium has leaves that are round to kidney-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a diameter of about 10â€“20 cm and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a clump-forming pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spherical, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense underground network that helps the plant spread and anchor itself.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum nummulariifolium is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist lowland forests and swampy areas, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. This plant is also present in parts of Australia, particularly in Queensland, where it grows along the coastal regions. It is often associated with disturbed soils and can be found in mangrove forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to regions with a warm, wet climate and high humidity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum nummulariifolium was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and disturbed soils, often as an ornamental plant or for erosion control.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a potential invasive species in non-native environments. It is commonly found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been reported in several regions outside its native range, raising concerns about ecological impacts.</p>
