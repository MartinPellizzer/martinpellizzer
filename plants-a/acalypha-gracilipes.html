<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha gracilipes belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of a complex life cycle involving alternation of generations. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a wide range of morphological diversity, including ferns and some modern flowering plants. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by its diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants known for their diverse habitats and includes many species with unique adaptations. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes a wide variety of plants with often milky sap and diverse growth forms. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupweed," characterized by their showy inflorescences and often hairy foliage.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha gracilipes, a specific type within the genus Acalypha, known for its slender stems and distinctive floral structures, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
