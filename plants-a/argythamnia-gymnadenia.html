                    <h1>Argythamnia gymnadenia</h1>
<p>Argythamnia gymnadenia, commonly known as the broadleaf everlasting or common everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fluffy, seed-producing heads that give it its common name. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and gravelly soils.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a silver-blue hue that helps it reflect sunlight in arid environments.</p>
