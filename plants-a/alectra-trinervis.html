<p>Alectra trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate thallus structure, which is typically crustose and forms a thin, adherent layer on substrates such as bark or rock. The plant exhibits a unique arrangement of photobionts and fungal symbionts, contributing to its ecological adaptability. Alectra trinervis is often found in temperate and boreal regions, thriving in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for environmental conditions and its contribution to soil and ecosystem stability.</p>
