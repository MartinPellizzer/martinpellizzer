                <h1>Achmandra rostrata</h1>
<p>Achmandra rostrata, commonly known as the rostrate achmandra, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in small inflorescences.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achmandra rostrata has leaves that are elongated, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a single, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achmandra rostrata is primarily native to the Caribbean, particularly the islands of the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. It is often seen in undergrowth areas where it can receive adequate light and humidity.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific regions, making it a rare and endemic species in the Caribbean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achmandra rostrata was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, rosette-forming foliage and unique flowering structure.</p>
<p>It has since spread into natural habitats, particularly in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types have contributed to its establishment in non-native regions. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas, posing a threat to native plant communities.</p>
<p>Its distribution continues to expand, raising concerns among conservationists and land managers.</p>
