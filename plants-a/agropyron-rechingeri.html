                    <h1>Agropyron rechingeri</h1>
<p>Agropyron rechingeri, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Asia, including the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that resemble needles, giving it its common name. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Agropyron rechingeri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat.</p>
