                <h1>Adonis preslii</h1>
<p>Adonis preslii, commonly known as the Preslia's glory-of-the-snow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are broad and lobed, with a silver-gray underside, and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms.</p>
<p>Adonis preslii is also known for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution in handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis preslii has basal leaves that are spoon-shaped, with a smooth surface, dark green in color, and arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark, growing from the base of the plant. Its flowers are yellow with a red center, consisting of five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis preslii is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This plant is commonly seen in mountainous areas of countries such as Spain, France, Italy, and Greece. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and can tolerate poor soil quality.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis preslii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as the Mediterranean Basin, Central Europe, and parts of North Africa. This plant has been introduced to new environments where it can thrive in dry, sunny conditions with minimal competition. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential to spread rapidly in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Adonis preslii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
