<p>Achillea buglossis, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, aromatic leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea buglossis has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and arranged in a rosette formation, with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hollow, and covered with fine hairs, growing from the base to form a flowering stalk. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pink to purple ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cylindrical achene, dispersed by wind due to the lightweight structure of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea buglossis is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in countries such as Italy, France, and Spain.</p>
<p>While its native range is well-defined, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America, where it is sometimes cultivated. It thrives in dry, rocky, or gravelly soils and is commonly found in alpine and subalpine environments. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea buglossis is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though its populations are relatively limited and may be vulnerable to habitat loss.</p>
