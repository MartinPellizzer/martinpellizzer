                <h1>Achillea buglossis</h1>
<p>Achillea buglossis, commonly known as lesser yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat, composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and blooms from June to August. Its flowers range in color from white to pale pink, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Achillea buglossis is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has been used historically for its medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea buglossis has narrow, linear leaves that are usually blue-gray in color, arranged in a basal rosette, and can grow up to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-green color, growing from the base with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white to pale blue petals, blooming from late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea buglossis is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in parts of southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as Spain, Portugal, and Morocco, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. It prefers dry, sunny environments and is commonly found in grasslands, scrublands, and along coastal areas. This plant typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from habitat loss, Achillea buglossis is listed as a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea buglossis is a hardy perennial plant known for its vibrant blue to purple flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the root clumps in early spring. The growth cycle of Achillea buglossis involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in summer, and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, though it benefits from occasional deep watering during dry spells. For optimal growth, apply a balanced fertilizer in early spring and prune faded flowers to encourage continuous blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea buglossis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, which contribute to the ecosystem's balance. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other wildflowers to enhance biodiversity in meadows and gardens. Its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and protecting against water runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports soil health by improving nutrient content through its root system.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea buglossis is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and historical significance.</p>
<p>It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. While not widely cultivated for culinary purposes, it may have had minor uses in herbal teas or infusions.
