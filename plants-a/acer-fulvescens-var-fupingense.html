                <h1>Acer fulvescens var. fupingense</h1>
<p>Acer fulvescens var. fupingense, commonly known as the Fuping maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens var. fupingense has palmately compound leaves that are typically ovate to ovate-lanceolate in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and are bright green in summer, turning yellow or orange in autumn. The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruits are samaras, each containing a single seed, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting well to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens var. fupingense is a rare maple species native to China, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Shaanxi and Sichuan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Fuping area of Shaanxi. This plant thrives in temperate forests with well-drained soil and moderate humidity. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,200 and 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat fragmentation, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens var. fupingense is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter offering quicker results. The growth cycle involves rapid spring growth, followed by a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lavender or marigold can help deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens var. fupingense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, offering long-term ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens var. fupingense is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is occasionally used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for wildlife, which contributes to its ecological value. While not widely cultivated for industrial purposes, its wood may be used in small-scale crafts or construction in certain regions. Culturally, it is not as symbolically significant as other maple species, but it is appreciated for its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications are more ecological and medicinal than economic or cultural.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens var. fupingense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Autumn Flame' and 'Red Dragon,' known for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habits. Hybrids with other maple species, such as *Acer palmatum*, have been developed to enhance leaf color and adaptability to different climates. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in urban landscapes.</p>
<p>Their unique characteristics make them a sought-after choice for gardeners and landscapers worldwide.</p>
