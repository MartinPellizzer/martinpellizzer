<p>Achras sapatilla, commonly known as the Natal plum, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, red or orange fruits resembling plums. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils. It is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance.</p>
<p>The fruits are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor, making them a valuable food source for wildlife and humans alike.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras sapatilla has palmate leaves that are large, deeply lobed, and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and short, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a fibrous, spiny capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently in its native arid environment.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras sapatilla is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, specifically found in parts of Cuba, the Bahamas, and the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes tropical regions of the Americas, where it has been introduced and cultivated in various warm climates. It thrives in coastal areas, mangroves, and disturbed soils near the shoreline. This species typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 100 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Achras sapatilla is considered a species of concern and is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras sapatilla is a slow-growing, ornamental tree native to tropical regions, known for its unique, spiky leaves and edible fruit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings often yielding better results due to their higher survival rate. The growth cycle of Achras sapatilla is typically slow, with the plant reaching maturity over several years, and it thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it requires well-draining soil and regular watering, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season and occasional pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or fungal issues.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like bananas or palms can enhance its growth and provide mutual support in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras sapatilla is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of nearby species by improving soil conditions. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity of the ecosystem by supporting a variety of insects and small mammals.</p>
