                <h1>Achras sapatilla</h1>
<p>Achras sapatilla, commonly known as the "Sapatilla tree," is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palm trees, and is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, fleshy berries. Its trunk is often swollen at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras sapatilla has large, palmate leaves that are typically bright green, with a broad, fan-like shape and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant, and they can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. The stem is thick and woody, with a rough, fibrous bark that is dark brown in color. The plant produces large, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, and they are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a large, spiky capsule that disperses its seeds through wind and animal consumption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras sapatilla is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and parts of the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas and dry forests. This plant is commonly associated with sandy soils and is often seen growing near the shoreline. It is also known as the "palo de tigre" or "tree of the tiger" due to its hard, dense wood.</p>
<p>Its natural range includes regions with a warm, humid climate and well-drained soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras sapatilla was mainly introduced to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba, as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in urban landscapes and along roadsides, where it thrives in disturbed soils and full sun. The plant has also been introduced to parts of Florida and other southern regions of the United States. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have led to its classification as an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it poses a threat to native plant communities by outcompeting them for resources.</p>
