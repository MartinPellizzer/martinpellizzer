                <h1>Aechmea wrightii</h1>
<p>Aechmea wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with vibrant red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Aechmea wrightii is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in indoor conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea wrightii has rosette-shaped leaves that are long, narrow, and stiff, arranged in a tight spiral around the central stem, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright from the base of the plant. It produces compact, spadix-like inflorescences with small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall, pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>
