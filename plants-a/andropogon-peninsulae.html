<p>Andropogon peninsulae, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>However, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes.</p>
