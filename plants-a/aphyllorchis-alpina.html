                    <h1>Aphyllorchis alpina</h1>
<p>Aphyllorchis alpina, commonly known as the alpine orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and lack of true leaves, relying instead on its fleshy, photosynthetic stems for energy. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows where it can access limited nutrients and sunlight. Its reproductive strategy involves insect pollination, which is crucial for its survival in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Aphyllorchis alpina is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
