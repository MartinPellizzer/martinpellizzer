                    <h1>Arthraxon caucasicus</h1>
<p>Arthraxon caucasicus, commonly known as the Caucasian flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along riverbanks and in swampy areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in dense tufts, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Arthraxon caucasicus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water retention.</p>
