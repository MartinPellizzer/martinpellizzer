<p>Aspidium quinquangulare, commonly known as the five-angled water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lanceolate fronds that are often divided into five angular segments, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Aspidium quinquangulare is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions.</p>
