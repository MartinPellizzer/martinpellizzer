<p>Acer shirasawanum f. aureum, commonly known as the golden maple, is a cultivar of the Japanese maple known for its striking foliage.</p>
<p>It features vibrant yellow leaves that turn red in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has a compact growth habit with a rounded canopy, and its leaves are typically 5-lobed. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, requiring regular watering during dry periods.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in gardens and landscapes for its seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer shirasawanum f. aureum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-8 cm in length, with a striking golden-yellow coloration during the growing season.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer shirasawanum f. aureum is a rare variant of the Japanese maple known for its striking yellow foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Japan, particularly in the Chubu and Kansai areas. While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the wild. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer shirasawanum f. aureum is a striking ornamental tree known for its golden foliage and compact growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The tree grows slowly, reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in temperate climates with full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should be watered sparingly during winter to avoid root rot. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead branches.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale or aphids, and it pairs well with hostas or ferns in the garden.</p>
