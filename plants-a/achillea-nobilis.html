                <h1>Achillea nobilis</h1>
<p>Achillea nobilis, commonly known as noble yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system and upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads composed of small white to pinkish florets, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a silvery-green underside, and are aromatic when crushed.</p>
<p>Achillea nobilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a gray-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a basal rosette and can grow up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly woody with a reddish-brown color, growing from the base to form a flowering stalk. Its flowers are flat-topped clusters (compound umbels) composed of small white or pale yellow petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis is primarily native to southern Europe, the Mediterranean region, and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often associated with mountainous and coastal regions.</p>
<p>Its native range includes countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and Morocco.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy yellow flowers and aromatic foliage. However, in some regions, it has become an invasive species, outcompeting native plants in disturbed habitats. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to produce大量 seeds and thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its unchecked proliferation in natural ecosystems.</p>
