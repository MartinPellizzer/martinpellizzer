<p>Achillea nobilis, commonly known as the noble yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and prefers well-drained soils in sunny to partially shaded locations. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Achillea nobilis is also valued for its traditional medicinal uses, particularly for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis has leaves that are basal, spoon-shaped, and have a silver-gray color with a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-brown color, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are yellow with a central disc, arranged in flat-topped umbels, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it is now cultivated and naturalized in various temperate regions around the world. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and open grasslands. It typically grows at altitudes between 0 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat is threatened by habitat loss and urbanization.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis is a hardy perennial plant known for its attractive, fern-like foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the root system or by sowing seeds in early spring. The growth cycle of Achillea nobilis typically involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its health and appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too damp.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
