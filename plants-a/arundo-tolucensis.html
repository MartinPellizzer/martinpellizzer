<p>Arundo tolucensis, commonly known as the Mexican reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, jointed stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its use in traditional crafts and as a source of biofuel.</p>
