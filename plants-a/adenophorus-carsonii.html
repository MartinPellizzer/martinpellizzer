                <h1>Adenophorus carsonii</h1>
<p>Adenophorus carsonii, commonly known as Carson's腺毛草, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive leaf structure and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique botanical features, such as its glandular hairs and floral morphology, make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophorus carsonii has small, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 1–2 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
