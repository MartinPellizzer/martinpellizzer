<p>Acer heldreichii f. cruciatum, commonly known as the Balkan maple, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a striking yellow-green hue during the growing season. The plant produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists.</p>
