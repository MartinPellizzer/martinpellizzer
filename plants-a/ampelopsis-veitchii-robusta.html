                    <h1>Ampelopsis veitchii robusta</h1>
<p>Ampelopsis veitchii robusta, commonly known as the robust grape ivy, is a vigorous climbing vine native to China.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly pubescent underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it is often used for covering trellises or as a ground cover in gardens.</p>
