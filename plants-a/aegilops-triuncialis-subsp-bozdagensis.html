<p>Aegilops triuncialis subsp.</p>
<p>bozdagensis, commonly known as the Bozdag wild rye, is a perennial grass native to Turkey. It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic proximity to wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for potential crop improvement.</p>
