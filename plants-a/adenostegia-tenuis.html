                <h1>Adenostegia tenuis</h1>
<p>Adenostegia tenuis, commonly known as the slender stemless dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Adenostegia tenuis is adapted to arid conditions and has a low-growing habit to conserve moisture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostegia tenuis has small, narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, with white petals and a distinct scent, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia tenuis is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with areas that have a Mediterranean climate characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>
<p>Adenostegia tenuis plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia tenuis was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland dunes, where its rapid growth helps prevent sand movement. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is tolerant of salt spray, making it suitable for coastal restoration projects. However, its invasive nature has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological benefits, management strategies are often needed to prevent its spread into non-target habitats.</p>
