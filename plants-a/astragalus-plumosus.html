                    <h1>Astragalus plumosus</h1>
<p>Astragalus plumosus, commonly known as the silky milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its soft, feathery leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria.</p>
<p>Astragalus plumosus is often found in prairies, steppe, and desert scrub habitats.</p>
