                        <h1>Acalypha urostachya</h1>
<p>Acalypha urostachya, commonly known as the flame bush, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that vary in shape depending on the species. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Acalypha urostachya thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha urostachya is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of tropical Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forests or along stream banks. It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest regions, where it contributes to the understory vegetation.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely tied to the humid tropical climates of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha urostachya was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the late 19th century by European settlers who admired its aesthetic value. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and spreads through both seeds and vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native ornamental plants.</p>
