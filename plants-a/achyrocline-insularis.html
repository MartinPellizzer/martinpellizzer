                <h1>Achyrocline insularis</h1>
<p>Achyrocline insularis, commonly known as the island achyrocline, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are often clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline insularis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and slightly hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in fine, white hairs, and has a pale greenish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, with a pale blue to violet color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline insularis is primarily native to the Caribbean Islands, particularly the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and dry forests. It is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of these islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline insularis was mainly introduced to the Gal√°pagos Islands.</p>
<p>It was brought there by human activity, likely through accidental transport on ships or intentional introduction for ornamental purposes. This plant has since become naturalized in certain areas of the archipelago. Its distribution is limited to specific coastal and lowland habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
