<p>Abronia suksdorfii, commonly known as the Saksdorf's bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. This plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers are aerial, featuring distinctive blue or purple petals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
