<p>Aeschynomene indica var. aspera, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features small, pale green to yellowish leaves with a rough, textured surface due to its pubescent foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale pink flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically followed by small, triangular seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil improvement and erosion control.</p>
