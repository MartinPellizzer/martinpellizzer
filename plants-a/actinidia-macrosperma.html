                <h1>Actinidia macrosperma</h1>
<p>Actinidia macrosperma, commonly known as the large-seeded actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 7 lobes, and its fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, fuzzy berries that mature to a dark blue or black color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits.</p>
<p>Actinidia macrosperma is also valued for its potential in horticulture and as a source of natural compounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia macrosperma has leaves that are heart-shaped, simple, and alternate, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes furrowed with age. It produces small, greenish-white flowers with five sepals and petals, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a hairy, yellowish berry that matures in late summer, containing small, smooth seeds dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia macrosperma is primarily native to China South-Central and China Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. The plant is often associated with forest understories and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of southern and central China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia macrosperma was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of horticultural and ornamental plant imports.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along stream banks due to its attractive foliage and fruit-bearing qualities. The plant has become naturalized in certain areas, particularly in the North Island, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. It is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to spread through seed dispersal by water and animals.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its invasive potential has raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
