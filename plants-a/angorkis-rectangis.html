                    <h1>Angorkis rectangis</h1>
<p>Angorkis rectangis, commonly known as the square-stemmed angorkis, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its distinctly quadrangular stems.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Angorkidaceae and is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and slightly serrated, providing a striking contrast to its rigid stem structure.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
