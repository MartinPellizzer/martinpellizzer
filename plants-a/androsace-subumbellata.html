<p>Androsace subumbellata, commonly known as the snow bell, is a low-growing alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, giving it a bell-like appearance. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Androsace subumbellata thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats.</p>
