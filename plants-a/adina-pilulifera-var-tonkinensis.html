                <h1>Adina pilulifera var. tonkinensis</h1>
<p>Adina pilulifera var. tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin red sanders, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is valued in traditional medicine and is also cultivated for its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina pilulifera var. tonkinensis has alternate, elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a smooth margin and slightly tapered tips.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom in spring; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that splits open to release smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina pilulifera var. tonkinensis is a rare plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam and Laos.</p>
<p>While its native range was once broader, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated regions in Vietnam. It thrives in humid, lowland forests with high rainfall and well-drained soils. This species typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 600 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is currently classified as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adina pilulifera var. tonkinensis is a fast-growing, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, commonly cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, reaching maturity within 2â€“3 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogged roots. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and encourage bushiness are essential for optimal growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adina pilulifera var. tonkinensis is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, improving soil fertility and supporting the growth of other plants. It also serves as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing biodiversity.</p>
<p>Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, contributing to the stability of the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adina pilulifera var. tonkinensis is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses, though it has been traditionally used in some regions for its medicinal properties, particularly in treating respiratory ailments.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally used in local cuisines as a seasoning or flavoring agent. Its hard wood is sometimes utilized in the production of furniture and crafts, contributing to its economic value in certain areas.
