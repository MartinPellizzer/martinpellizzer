<p>Anarthria ischaemoides, commonly known as the false sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are oblanceolate, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Anarthria ischaemoides is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient environments.</p>
