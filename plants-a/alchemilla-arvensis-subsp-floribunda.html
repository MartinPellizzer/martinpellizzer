<p>Alchemilla arvensis subsp.</p>
<p>floribunda, commonly known as the showy lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long flowering period.</p>
