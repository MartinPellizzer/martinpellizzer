                <h1>Adiantum thongthamii</h1>
<p>Adiantum thongthamii, commonly known as the Thai maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Thailand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble feathers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a unique trait that helps it attract certain insects.</p>
<p>Adiantum thongthamii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum thongthamii has fronds that are pinnate, with a delicate, fern-like appearance, typically measuring 10â€“20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bipinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae, and are usually a vibrant green, sometimes with a bluish tinge. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is smooth and slightly woody, growing in a creeping or climbing pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures rather than true flowers, and its spores are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum thongthamii is primarily native to Thailand.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the northern and western areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant is known for its delicate, fern-like fronds and is often found in humid, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific habitats within Thailand, making it a unique and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum thongthamii was mainly introduced to Thailand, where it is commonly found in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate fern that thrives in humid conditions, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens. Its introduction to Thailand has contributed to the diversity of local flora.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>
