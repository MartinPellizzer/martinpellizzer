                <h1>Aconogonon cathayanum</h1>
<p>Aconogonon cathayanum, commonly known as the Chinese bellflower, is a flowering plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has hairy stems and leaves. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Aconogonon cathayanum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconogonon cathayanum has palmately compound leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with leaflets that are ovate to elliptic in shape, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length, and have a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright with a few branches. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals, and bloom during the summer months; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconogonon cathayanum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of China, India, and Myanmar.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid, tropical, and subtropical climates at higher elevations. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with forest understory environments. It is particularly prevalent in the Himalayan foothills and the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconogonon cathayanum was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in wet forest habitats. The plant spreads rapidly through seed dispersal by water and animals.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
