                    <h1>Aspidium pteroides</h1>
<p>Aspidium pteroides, commonly known as the creeping woodfern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often clustered at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
