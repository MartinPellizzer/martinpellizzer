                        <h1>Abrus bottae</h1>
<p>Abrus bottae, commonly known as the purple bean vine, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive purple to reddish-brown seed pods that contain flat, kidney-shaped seeds. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and has compound leaves with three to five leaflets. Its seeds contain toxic lectins, making them harmful if ingested.</p>
<p>Abrus bottae is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking pod color and vine-like growth habit.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abrus bottae belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some green algae, characterized by their complex cellular structures and photosynthetic capabilities. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and often having spore-producing structures. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that typically have showy flowers and are often associated with primitive floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which includes plants such as legumes and vetches, known for their ability to form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by their distinctive pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Its genus is Abrus, a group of flowering plants that includes species known for their toxic seeds and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its species is Abrus bottae, a specific type of plant within the Abrus genus, known for its unique morphology and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus bottae is primarily native to Saudi Arabia and Yemen.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in dry, open habitats. The distribution of Abrus bottae is closely associated with the desert and coastal areas of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional practices.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus bottae was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, flame-like flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, where it can sometimes become invasive.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a non-native species with limited ecological impact compared to other invasive plants.</p>
