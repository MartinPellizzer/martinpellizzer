                    <h1>Athyrium × paludicola</h1>
<p>Athyrium × paludicola, commonly known as the marsh fern, is a hybrid fern species that results from the cross between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium capillus-veneris.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green with a pale underside. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors, where it can absorb the necessary humidity for its growth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle.</p>
<p>Athyrium × paludicola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, partially shaded conditions.</p>
