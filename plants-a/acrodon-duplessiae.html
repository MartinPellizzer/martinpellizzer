                <h1>Acrodon duplessiae</h1>
<p>Acrodon duplessiae, commonly known as the desert stonecress, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its leaves are small and fleshy, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acrodon duplessiae is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities, contributing to the biodiversity of these harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrodon duplessiae has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a bluish-gray color and a hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is generally grayish-brown in color, and it grows in a sprawling or ascending pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, and are pale blue to white in color, blooming from spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodon duplessiae is primarily native to the Chihuahuan Desert region of Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is found in areas such as Texas, New Mexico, and parts of Coahuila and Chihuahua in Mexico. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in crevices and on limestone outcrops.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodon duplessiae was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, silver-gray foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it difficult to control once established.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among land managers and conservationists.</p>
