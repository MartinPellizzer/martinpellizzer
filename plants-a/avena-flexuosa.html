                    <h1>Avena flexuosa</h1>
<p>Avena flexuosa, commonly known as bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Avena flexuosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for various organisms.</p>
