<p>Acaena minor var. antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic pearlwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, spiny fruits that contain nutritious seeds. The plant thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in alpine and subantarctic regions. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Acaena minor var. antarctica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
