                <h1>Adonis sibirica</h1>
<p>Adonis sibirica, commonly known as Siberian glory-of-the-snow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and Siberia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that bear clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Adonis sibirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis sibirica has alternate, basal leaves that are lanceolate, hairy, and typically 5–10 cm long, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a reddish-brown color, growing from 30–60 cm in height. The flowers are yellow, cup-shaped with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis sibirica is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and southern Russia.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. This plant is commonly associated with the steppes and forest-steppe zones of the region. It is also found in parts of northern China and Mongolia.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often restricted to remote and less disturbed areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis sibirica was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in regions with moderate to high sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>It thrives in open landscapes such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed sites where it can establish itself quickly. The plant is often found in the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Its introduction has been largely unintentional, often through seed dispersal by wind or human activity.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
