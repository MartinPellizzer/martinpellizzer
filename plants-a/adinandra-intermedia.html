                <h1>Adinandra intermedia</h1>
<p>Adinandra intermedia, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>Adinandra intermedia plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra intermedia has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green color with a slightly glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out near the surface, helping the plant absorb nutrients and water efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra intermedia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in shaded environments and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed sites. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a regionally important species for biodiversity conservation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra intermedia was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal and lowland forest environments, often found in secondary growth and disturbed habitats. The plant is commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and resilience to environmental stress. It has been introduced to several parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native ecosystems.</p>
