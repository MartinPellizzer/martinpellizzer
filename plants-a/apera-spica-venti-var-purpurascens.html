<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive purple-tinged inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and fields. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes more purple in the inflorescence.</p>
