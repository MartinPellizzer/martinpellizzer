                <h1>Amylotheca palawanensis</h1>
<p>Amylotheca palawanensis, commonly known as the Palawan lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which forms a tightly adherent layer on the substrate, typically found on rock surfaces in humid tropical environments. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic alga and a fungus, which together form the composite organism. It is endemic to the Palawan region of the Philippines, where it thrives in shaded, moist microhabitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
