                <h1>Acropera cornuta</h1>
<p>Acropera cornuta, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that resemble horns. The plant features vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Acropera cornuta thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure includes a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acropera cornuta has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a rough, greyish bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out just below the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropera cornuta is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests and swampy areas where the climate is humid and the soil is rich in organic matter. This species thrives in warm, moist environments and is often associated with riverine and coastal vegetation. Its distribution is also observed in parts of northern Australia and New Guinea.</p>
<p>Acropera cornuta is an important component of the local flora in these regions, contributing to the biodiversity of the ecosystems it inhabits.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropera cornuta was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become established in various regions of the country. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and on disturbed sites such as roadsides and urban environments. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental transport via human activities.</p>
<p>Acropera cornuta is considered a potential weed due to its ability to spread rapidly in new habitats.</p>
