<p>Agropyron miserum, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its leaves are typically narrow and tough, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Agropyron miserum plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats.</p>
