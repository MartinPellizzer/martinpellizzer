                    <h1>Actinostachys inopinata</h1>
<p>Actinostachys inopinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread through the forest understory. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with closely spaced, linear pinnae that give it a delicate, grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing along stream banks or in humid, low-light habitats.</p>
