                <h1>Actinoseris corymbosa</h1>
<p>Actinoseris corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences that produce orange or yellow flowers. The plant has succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it retain water in dry environments. Its milky sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, a common trait among members of its family.</p>
<p>Actinoseris corymbosa is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinoseris corymbosa has alternate, ovate leaves that are usually light green and slightly hairy, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age, growing in a clumping pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish-white, and clustered in corymbs, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoseris corymbosa is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This species thrives in environments such as deserts, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It is often associated with the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes states like Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas in the United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoseris corymbosa was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system. It has become naturalized in several coastal areas along the California coast.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to invade native plant communities.</p>
