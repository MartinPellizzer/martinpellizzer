<p>Actinoseris corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences that produce orange or yellow flowers. The plant has succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it retain water in dry environments. Its milky sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, a common trait among members of its family.</p>
<p>Actinoseris corymbosa is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained conditions.</p>
