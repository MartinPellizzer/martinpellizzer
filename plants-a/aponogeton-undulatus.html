<p>Aponogeton undulatus, commonly known as the wavy-leaf water arum, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that undulate in the water, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in ponds and aquariums.</p>
<p>Aponogeton undulatus is also notable for its ability to produce large, fleshy tubers that can survive in water for extended periods.</p>
