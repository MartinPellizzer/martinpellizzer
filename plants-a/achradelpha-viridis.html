                <h1>Achradelpha viridis</h1>
<p>Achradelpha viridis, commonly known as the green sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and coastal environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achradelpha viridis has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. It produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to absorb moisture from the dry environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achradelpha viridis is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia, Angola, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in grassland and shrubland habitats. This plant is well adapted to dry climates and can survive with minimal rainfall. It is often seen in coastal areas and along riverbanks in its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to specific ecological conditions that support its growth and survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achradelpha viridis was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it can thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures, such as parts of Australia and the southwestern United States. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and erosion control due to its hardy nature. Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native plant species in invaded areas.</p>
<p>Overall, Achradelpha viridis plays a role in both ecological and agricultural systems in its introduced range.</p>
