                <h1>Adamia cyanea</h1>
<p>Adamia cyanea, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its striking blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers consist of three petals and three sepals, which are often tinged with white or purple.</p>
<p>Adamia cyanea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adamia cyanea has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with blue-violet petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamia cyanea is primarily native to the eastern and southern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, and Texas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often associated with coastal and inland wetland habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its native range also extends into parts of Mexico, where it grows in similar wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamia cyanea was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Washington State in the early 2000s. The plant has since spread to parts of Oregon and British Columbia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments along stream banks and in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on native plant species.</p>
