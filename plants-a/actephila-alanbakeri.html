                <h1>Actephila alanbakeri</h1>
<p>Actephila alanbakeri, commonly known as the Alanbaker's actephila, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth texture, and its flowers are often white or pale pink, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Actephila alanbakeri is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila alanbakeri has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a twisting growth pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, with five petals and a tubular structure, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in nutrient-rich, moist soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila alanbakeri is primarily native to Borneo and the Philippines.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of these regions. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within lowland and montane forests. The plant is often associated with specific substrates such as mossy soils or rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution highlights its ecological specificity and vulnerability to habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila alanbakeri was mainly introduced to disturbed areas such as roadsides, clearings, and urban environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun conditions, making it adaptable to a variety of habitats. The plant spreads primarily through seeds dispersed by wind and water. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities and ecosystem balance.</p>
