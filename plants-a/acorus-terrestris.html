                <h1>Acorus terrestris</h1>
<p>Acorus terrestris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cattail, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that grow from a rhizomatous stem, and it produces dense, cylindrical spikes of yellowish-green flowers. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in shallow water and moist soil, making it a common sight in freshwater habitats. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Acorus terrestris plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus terrestris has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are bright green, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant, and can grow up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, pale brown bark that grows upright from the base. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in a spadix surrounded by a green spathe, blooming in early summer and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a three-lobed, dark purple berry that disperses its seeds through water, as the seeds are lightweight and buoyant.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming dense underground networks that help the plant spread and anchor itself in wet environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus terrestris is primarily native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is also found in Southeast Asia, such as in India, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines. This plant thrives in wetland environments, often growing in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. It is commonly associated with temperate and subtropical regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Acorus terrestris is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive, sword-shaped leaves.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus terrestris was mainly introduced to wetlands, marshes, and shallow water areas where it can thrive in moist to aquatic conditions.</p>
<p>It is often found in environments with partial to full sunlight, such as pond edges, stream banks, and flooded meadows. This plant is known for its aromatic rhizomes and its ability to tolerate a wide range of water depths. It has been introduced to various regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe, often as an ornamental or for wetland restoration.</p>
<p>However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and altering ecosystem dynamics.</p>
