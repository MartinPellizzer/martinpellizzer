<p>Abutilon hirsutissimum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a striking plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and thrives in warm, humid climates. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. Despite its beauty, it can be invasive in some regions, making it both admired and challenging to manage.</p>
