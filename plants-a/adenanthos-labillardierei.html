                <h1>Adenanthos labillardierei</h1>
<p>Adenanthos labillardierei, commonly known as the pink mottle or pink mottle grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pinkish or reddish mottling on its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in spring. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system, often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Adenanthos labillardierei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos labillardierei has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a compact, upright form. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green structures clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, blooming from late summer to autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
