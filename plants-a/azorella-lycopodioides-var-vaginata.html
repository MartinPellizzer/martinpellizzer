                    <h1>Azorella lycopodioides var. vaginata</h1>
<p>Azorella lycopodioides var. vaginata, commonly known as the Andean clubmoss, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats on the ground. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the leafy foliage, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat degradation.</p>
