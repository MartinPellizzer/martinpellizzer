<p>Adiantum lingii, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically silvery-white in color due to the presence of trichomes on the leaf surfaces. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or woodland areas. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum lingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
