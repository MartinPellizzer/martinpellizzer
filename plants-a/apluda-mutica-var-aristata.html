                    <h1>Apluda mutica var. aristata</h1>
<p>Apluda mutica var. aristata, commonly known as the hairy grass or slender grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
