It is typically found in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthus nitidus is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas and rocky habitats, often found along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. This plant is well adapted to the warm, sunny climates and well-drained soils typical of its native range. It is commonly found in countries such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its natural distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthus nitidus was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and garden design due to its striking foliage and architectural appearance.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in regions with mild climates where it can thrive throughout the growing season. The plant is often used in landscape architecture and as a decorative element in public spaces and private gardens.
