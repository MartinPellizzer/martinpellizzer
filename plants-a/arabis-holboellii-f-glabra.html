                    <h1>Arabis holboellii f. glabra</h1>
<p>Arabis holboellii f. glabra, commonly known as the glabrous rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs in the wild form. The glabrous form, however, lacks these hairs, giving it a smooth, hairless appearance. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
