                <h1>Adenostylis weberi</h1>
<p>Adenostylis weberi, commonly known as Weber's adenostylis, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and streambanks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences of white or pale yellow flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands.</p>
<p>Adenostylis weberi plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostylis weberi has leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the sandy soil it typically inhabits.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostylis weberi is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in areas with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. It is often associated with rocky soils and coastal environments.</p>
<p>Adenostylis weberi is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostylis weberi was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as part of botanical collections. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Despite its introduction, it is not considered invasive and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
