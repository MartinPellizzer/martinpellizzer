                <h1>Acrostichum conforme</h1>
<p>Acrostichum conforme, commonly known as the common brake, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common component of wetland vegetation.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum conforme has large, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows horizontally along the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum conforme is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Tahiti, and other parts of Polynesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas and lowland forests where there is high humidity and warm temperatures. This plant is commonly found along beaches and in mangrove swamps, where it adapts well to saline and waterlogged soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal environments and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Pacific Islands due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum conforme was mainly introduced to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates.</p>
<p>It was initially brought to these regions for its ornamental value due to its large, broad leaves. The plant has since become established in wetland and riparian habitats, often thriving in disturbed soils near water bodies. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to outcompete native vegetation in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies in some areas, it remains a popular choice for landscaping in tropical gardens.</p>
