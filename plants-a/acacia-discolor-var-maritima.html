                        <h1>Acacia discolor var. maritima</h1>
<p>Acacia discolor var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and bipinnate leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal vegetation. It plays a role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
<p>Its resilience to harsh maritime conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia discolor var. maritima is primarily native to coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found along the eastern and southern coasts, including the KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces. This variety thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with dune environments. It is well adapted to the saline and arid conditions of the coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in other regions with similar climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia discolor var. maritima was mainly introduced to coastal areas for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the shores of the Mediterranean and parts of southern Europe. This variety is known for its hardy nature and tolerance to salt spray and poor soil conditions. It has been used in ecological restoration projects due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has sometimes led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain environments.</p>
