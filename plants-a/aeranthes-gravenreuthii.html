<p>Aeranthes gravenreuthii, commonly known as the Gravenreuth's orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and somewhat elusive species in the orchid world.</p>
