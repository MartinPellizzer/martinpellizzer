                    <h1>Alsine decumbens</h1>
<p>Alsine decumbens, commonly known as creeping sandwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant has small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Alsine decumbens is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along roadsides and disturbed areas.</p>
