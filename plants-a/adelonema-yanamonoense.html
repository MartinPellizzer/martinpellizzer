                <h1>Adelonema yanamonoense</h1>
<p>Adelonema yanamonoense, commonly known as the Yanamono hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds.</p>
<p>Adelonema yanamonoense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelonema yanamonoense has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length and 2 to 4 cm in width, and they are usually a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema yanamonoense is primarily native to Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the Andean region of these countries. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in cloud forests or humid montane areas. Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these South American nations.</p>
<p>The plant is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema yanamonoense was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats due to its adaptability to different soil types. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental species because of its attractive foliage and hardy nature. It has been reported to spread through seed dispersal by wind and water.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
