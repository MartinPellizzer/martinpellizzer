                <h1>Acalypha stokesiae</h1>
<p>Acalypha stokesiae, commonly known as Stokes' beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It has heart-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance.</p>
<p>Acalypha stokesiae thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha stokesiae has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it grows upright with a branched structure. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with a greenish-white color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a蒴果 (capsule) containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and attached filaments.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha stokesiae is a rare plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo, specifically found in the Malaysian state of Sabah.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other regions such as the Philippines and Hawaii, though these populations are not well established. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high levels of rainfall and well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. This species typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acalypha stokesiae is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha stokesiae is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings, which root easily in moist soil, or through seeds sown in a well-draining mix. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha stokesiae is a flowering plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its vibrant flowers and nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. Its dense foliage helps prevent soil erosion by stabilizing the ground with its root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity of the ecosystem by supporting a range of insect and bird life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acalypha stokesiae is a flowering plant native to Madagascar, known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>While it is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and as a decorative plant, it has limited culinary use due to the lack of documented edible parts.
