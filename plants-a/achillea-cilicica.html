                <h1>Achillea cilicica</h1>
<p>Achillea cilicica, commonly known as Cyprus feverfew, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring basal leaves that are pinnately divided and gray-green in color. Its yellowish-orange flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Achillea cilicica is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea cilicica has basal leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a silver-gray underside and a dark green upper surface, arranged in a rosette formation and ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and cylindrical, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, growing in a compact, shrub-like pattern. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea cilicica is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean, specifically found in regions such as Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Middle East and has been introduced to some areas outside its native range. It thrives in dry, rocky environments, often growing on slopes and in open woodlands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea cilicica is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea cilicica is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rootstock or by sowing seeds in early spring. The plant has a dormant winter growth cycle, with active growth and flowering occurring in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and repel pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea cilicica is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting ecological balance. It also helps in erosion control due to its deep root system, which stabilizes soil in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea cilicica contributes to the overall health of its ecosystem by promoting soil fertility and supporting a diverse community of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
