                <h1>Achillea cilicica</h1>
<p>Achillea cilicica, commonly known as Cilician yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features upright stems covered in soft, gray-green leaves that are finely divided and aromatic. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea cilicica has compound, pinnatifid leaves that are gray-green in color, with a rough, hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, achene type, with small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea cilicica is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region, particularly Turkey and Cyprus.</p>
<p>It is currently found in parts of southern Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa, though its distribution has been reduced due to habitat loss. This species thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Achillea cilicica is considered to be of conservation concern due to its limited range and vulnerability to environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea cilicica is a hardy perennial plant known for its attractive, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seeds sown in late winter. The growth cycle begins with new growth in spring, followed by flowering in summer, and it goes dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding wet conditions. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune back spent flower stalks to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or rust in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>
