                <h1>Actinidia stellatopilosa</h1>
<p>Actinidia stellatopilosa, commonly known as the star-haired actinidia, is a deciduous shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is characterized by its finely hairy, star-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark purple color in late summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, and the plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Actinidia stellatopilosa thrives in temperate climates and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia stellatopilosa has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring approximately 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly furrowed with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The plant produces small, actinidic flowers that are white to pale yellow, with a distinctive star-like appearance, blooming in early spring and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a small, green berry that ripens to red, containing multiple seeds, and it is dispersed primarily by birds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia stellatopilosa is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of this area, including parts of Sichuan, Hubei, and Guizhou provinces. This plant thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often found in forests and on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this specific region in China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia stellatopilosa was mainly introduced to eastern and southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It was introduced for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and potential for use in horticulture. The plant has since become established in natural ecosystems, posing a risk to native plant communities. It is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to spread through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to monitor and manage its spread to protect local biodiversity.</p>
