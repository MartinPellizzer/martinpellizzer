<p>Anacamptis pyramidalis var. brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked pyramidal orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, erect flowering stems. The flowers are arranged in a pyramidal or racemose inflorescence, with spurred orchid blooms in shades of pink to purple. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
