                <h1>Acrostichum leprosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum leprosum, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a central stalk covered in a dense, velvety layer of spore-producing structures called sporangia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in both horticulture and natural ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum leprosum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically broad and dark green, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually elongated, with a rough texture and a pale underside, and can grow up to 1 meter in length. The stem is woody, with a rough, fibrous bark that is typically brown or gray in color, and it grows in a spreading or climbing pattern. Acrostichum leprosum produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, with a greenish-white color, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-lobed, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum leprosum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in swampy, wetland, and coastal areas where it thrives in moist, humid environments. This fern is also present in parts of the Caribbean and the southeastern United States. It prefers rich, organic soil and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to lowland areas with high humidity and consistent rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum leprosum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and wetlands where it forms dense stands. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its tolerance to salt spray and frequent flooding. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also influenced by human activity and climate change.</p>
