                    <h1>Arundo langsdorffii</h1>
<p>Arundo langsdorffii, commonly known as the narrowleaf reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found in riparian zones.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become invasive in non-native regions.</p>
