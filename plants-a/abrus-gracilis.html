<p>Abrus gracilis, commonly known as the slender maple or red maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and clusters of small, red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces distinctive, flat, bean-like pods that contain seeds with bright red, silky arils. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes.</p>
