                <h1>Acronia galerita</h1>
<p>Acronia galerita, commonly known as the common acronia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often releasing a mild scent when crushed.</p>
<p>Acronia galerita is a short-lived perennial that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and soil stability.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia galerita has small, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically green and smooth, with a slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branched. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through dryness, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia galerita is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with forested wetlands. Its distribution includes states such as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and parts of North Carolina.</p>
<p>Acronia galerita is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia galerita was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states such as California, Oregon, and Washington.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activities, including the transport of contaminated soil or plant materials. This distribution is primarily found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, urban areas, and agricultural fields. The plant has adapted well to these environments, leading to its successful establishment.</p>
<p>However, its spread is still limited compared to other invasive species in the region.</p>
