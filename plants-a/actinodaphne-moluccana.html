                <h1>Actinodaphne moluccana</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne moluccana, commonly known as the Moluccan laurel, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Indonesian archipelago.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes many aromatic and economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns from green to yellow or red when mature.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in tropical regions for its aesthetic and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne moluccana has simple, alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture and a length ranging from 5 to 12 cm.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops fissures as the plant matures, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming from March to June, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, globose berry that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds and through the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne moluccana is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Moluccas, Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Southeast Asia, particularly in the Philippines and New Guinea. It thrives in humid, lowland rainforest environments, often growing in dense undergrowth. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 600 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Actinodaphne moluccana is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne moluccana is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, known for its fragrant leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seed, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant has a long growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in warm, humid climates with indirect light.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring and summer supports healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and promote new growth. Common pests include scale insects and mealybugs, while root rot can occur if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving herbs like mint or lemongrass can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne moluccana is a tropical plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds due to its fragrant flowers and nectar-rich blooms. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity by creating a microhabitat for smaller plants and animals. Its dense foliage helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in humid and rainy environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
