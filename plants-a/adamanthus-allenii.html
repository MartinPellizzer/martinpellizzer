                <h1>Adamanthus allenii</h1>
<p>Adamanthus allenii, commonly known as the Florida hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Betulaceae and is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and alternate, simple leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are typical of the birch family. Its fruit is a small, winged nut enclosed in a hard, spiky husk.</p>
<p>Adamanthus allenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in the region's ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adamanthus allenii has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exudes a fragrant resin when cut. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in terminal panicles, and bloom in late spring to early summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's native wetland habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus allenii is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. This plant is commonly found in the coastal regions and the interior wetlands of these areas. It is well adapted to the humid and often waterlogged conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specific requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus allenii was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and other moist habitats within these regions. The plant was likely introduced through human activity, such as landscaping or horticultural practices. It has since become established in the wild, though its distribution remains relatively localized.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to ecologists due to its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
