                    <h1>Anthurium licium</h1>
<p>Anthurium licium, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped bracts that range in color from deep red to orange, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white spadix inflorescences that are surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Anthurium licium is popular as a ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
