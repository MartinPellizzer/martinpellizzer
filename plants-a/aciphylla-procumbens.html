<p>Aciphylla procumbens, commonly known as the cushion chenopod, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, reducing water loss through transpiration. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or reddish and appear in clusters during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Aciphylla procumbens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
