<p>Acystopteris taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species native to Taiwan.</p>
