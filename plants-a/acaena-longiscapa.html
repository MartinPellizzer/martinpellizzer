                    <h1>Acaena longiscapa</h1>
<p>Acaena longiscapa, commonly known as the long-stemmed burr plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with dense, spiny bracts. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by the development of persistent, spherical burrs. These burrs contain seeds that are adapted for dispersal by animals, contributing to the plant's ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Acaena longiscapa is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight.</p>
