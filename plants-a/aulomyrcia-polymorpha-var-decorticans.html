                    <h1>Aulomyrcia polymorpha var. decorticans</h1>
<p>Aulomyrcia polymorpha var. decorticans, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat.</p>
