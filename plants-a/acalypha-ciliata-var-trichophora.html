                <h1>Acalypha ciliata var. trichophora</h1>
<p>Acalypha ciliata var. trichophora, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silky hibiscus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, softly hairy leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems and a sprawling or upright form depending on environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha ciliata var. trichophora has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white bracts, and they bloom from late spring to early summer, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a three-lobed schizocarp, dispersing via wind when the seeds are released.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's establishment and spread.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha ciliata var. trichophora is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is now also distributed in parts of India and the Philippines, often as a result of human introduction. This species thrives in moist, tropical environments, typically in lowland rainforests or along riverbanks. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered a species of concern, though its exact conservation status varies by region.</p>
