                <h1>Acianthera iguapensis</h1>
<p>Acianthera iguapensis, commonly known as the Iguapé orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Amazon rainforest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, often found in shaded, humid environments near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions, and it plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera iguapensis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more cracked with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale purple petals and a tubular shape, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera iguapensis is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the states of Pará, Maranhão, and Piauí. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with dense vegetation. The plant is typically found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera iguapensis was mainly introduced to the Neotropical region, particularly in South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in Brazil, Peru, and Colombia, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. This orchid is typically associated with forest understories and rocky outcrops, preferring well-drained soils. Its introduction has been largely due to horticultural trade and botanical exploration.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and remains a relatively localized species in its native range.</p>
