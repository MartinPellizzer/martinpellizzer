                <h1>Ampelopsis botria</h1>
<p>Ampelopsis botria, commonly known as the trailing ivy grape, is a vigorous climbing vine native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in partial to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive if not properly managed.</p>
