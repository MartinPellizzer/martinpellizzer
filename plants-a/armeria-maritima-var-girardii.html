<p>Armeria maritima var. girardii, commonly known as the Girard's thrift, is a coastal plant native to the eastern coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces dense clusters of white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to salt spray and harsh maritime conditions, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens.</p>
