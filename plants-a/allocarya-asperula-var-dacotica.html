                    <h1>Allocarya asperula var. dacotica</h1>
<p>Allocarya asperula var. dacotica, commonly known as the roughleaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces, often found in dry, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a pale to dark gray or brown coloration, with a rough, uneven texture that gives it its common name. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing on soil, bark, or stone.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and localized species.</p>
