                <h1>Achillea tianschanica</h1>
<p>Achillea tianschanica, commonly known as the Tianshan yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and basal rosette of linear, gray-green leaves. The plant produces numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a sought-after plant in horticulture and ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea tianschanica has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-green color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets and dark brown disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene, with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tianschanica is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, specifically found in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan.</p>
<p>It currently has a restricted distribution, primarily inhabiting the Tianshan and Pamir mountain ranges. This plant thrives in dry, rocky environments with well-drained soil, often growing in alpine meadows and grasslands. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat degradation and limited study, its conservation status is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for further research and protection efforts.</p>
