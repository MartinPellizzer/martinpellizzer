                    <h1>Argythamnia lineata</h1>
<p>Argythamnia lineata, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Argythamnia lineata is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
