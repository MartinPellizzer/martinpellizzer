<p>Astragalus chrysostachys f. parisiensis, commonly known as the Parisian golden milkvetch, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Astragalus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, golden-yellow floral clusters that resemble small, clustered candles, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is native to specific regions in Europe. Its foliage consists of small, trifoliate leaves, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
