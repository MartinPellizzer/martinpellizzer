                    <h1>Arthrocnemum decumbens</h1>
<p>Arthrocnemum decumbens, commonly known as the stonecress or desert sandplant, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Arthrocnemum decumbens plays a vital role in stabilizing desert dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
