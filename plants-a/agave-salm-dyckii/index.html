                            <h1>Agave Salm-Dyckii</h1>
<p>Blue agave, scientifically known as Agave salm-dyckii, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. Its most distinctive feature is its vibrant blue-green leaves, which are thick and succulent, adapted to thrive in arid environments. This species is closely related to the blue agave used in tequila production, though it is less commonly cultivated for commercial purposes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh conditions with minimal water. The plant also plays a role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
