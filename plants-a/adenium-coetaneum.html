                <h1>Adenium coetaneum</h1>
<p>Adenium coetaneum, commonly known as the desert candle, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy trunk and smooth, often reddish bark. The plant has striking, lobed leaves and produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. Its unique appearance and ability to store water in its trunk make it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Adenium coetaneum is also known for its toxic sap, which contains various alkaloids.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenium coetaneum has thick, fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, typically ranging from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a glossy green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually a deep reddish-brown, and it grows in a branching pattern near the base. The flowers are large, showy, and typically pink or red, with a spurred shape, blooming in the dry season and pollinated by birds or insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>The roots are thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage, and often form a swollen base known as a caudex.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium coetaneum is primarily native to the dry savannas and thorny woodlands of eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Mozambique, and South Africa. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid regions with well-drained soils. It is commonly found near rivers and in rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes parts of the Arabian Peninsula as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium coetaneum was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive red flowers and swollen caudex. It has also been introduced to some areas outside its native range for horticultural purposes.</p>
<p>However, its introduction can sometimes lead to ecological impacts in non-native environments.</p>
