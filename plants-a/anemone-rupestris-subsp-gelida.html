<p>Anemone rupestris subsp.</p>
<p>gelida, commonly known as the alpine anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it forms dense clusters of showy, white to pink flowers.</p>
<p>The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. It blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>
