<p>Aloinopsis jamesii, commonly known as the James' aloinopsis, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
