                    <h1>Arthrostylidium urbanii</h1>
<p>Arthrostylidium urbanii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat its fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to photosynthesize partially allows it to survive in shaded environments while still relying on its host for water and nutrients.</p>
