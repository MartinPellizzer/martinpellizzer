                    <h1>Aspidium obscurum</h1>
<p>Aspidium obscurum, commonly known as the dark wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which help in absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, somewhat rugged texture that aids in its identification.</p>
