                    <h1>Athyrium pumilio</h1>
<p>Athyrium pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf chain fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters, or sori, on the underside of its fronds, typical of the fern family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes.</p>
