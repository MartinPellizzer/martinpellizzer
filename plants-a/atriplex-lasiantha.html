                    <h1>Atriplex lasiantha</h1>
<p>Atriplex lasiantha, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent leaves, which are adapted to store water and reduce transpiration in dry environments. The plant has small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity.</p>
<p>Atriplex lasiantha plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife and livestock.</p>
