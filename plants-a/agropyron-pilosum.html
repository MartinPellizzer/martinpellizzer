                    <h1>Agropyron pilosum</h1>
<p>Agropyron pilosum, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, and its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs. Agropyron pilosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Its seeds are also utilized in traditional herbal medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
