<p>Agropyron reflexiaristatum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded grassland areas.</p>
