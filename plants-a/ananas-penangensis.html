                    <h1>Ananas penangensis</h1>
<p>Ananas penangensis, commonly known as the Penang pineapple, is a unique bromeliad native to the island of Penang in Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a single, spiky flower that emerges from the center of the rosette. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical environment.</p>
<p>While not typically cultivated for fruit, it holds cultural significance in local horticulture and botanic gardens.</p>
