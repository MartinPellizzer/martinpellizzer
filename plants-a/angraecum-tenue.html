                    <h1>Angraecum tenue</h1>
<p>Angraecum tenue, commonly known as the slender star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pendant inflorescences bearing small, star-shaped flowers with white petals and a distinctive violet or purple lip. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. It blooms during the dry season, typically between July and September, and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Angraecum tenue is considered a conservation concern.</p>
