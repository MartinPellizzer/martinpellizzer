<p>Axonopus stragulus, commonly known as the creeping grass or narrowleaf carpetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has slender, rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread aggressively across the ground, forming dense mats. The leaves are narrow, flat, and slightly hairy, with a blue-green coloration. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, wetlands, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
