<p>Alnus alnobetula var. corylifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green on top. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are wind-pollinated, and its flowers are followed by small, triangular nuts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water bodies.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
