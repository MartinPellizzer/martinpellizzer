                <h1>Adenocalymma divaricatum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma divaricatum, commonly known as the variable adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in clusters. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma divaricatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma divaricatum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2â€“5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that exudes a sticky resin when damaged. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma divaricatum is primarily native to Brazil Northeast and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the coastal regions and nearby inland areas of these regions. It thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with dune environments. The species is adapted to the tropical climate with high humidity and moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma divaricatum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and degraded grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and anthropogenic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in disturbed areas across its range.</p>
