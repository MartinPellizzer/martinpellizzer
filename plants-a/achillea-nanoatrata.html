                <h1>Achillea nanoatrata</h1>
<p>Achillea nanoatrata, commonly known as the dwarf yarrow, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features fine, silver-gray foliage and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, exhibiting drought tolerance once established.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea nanoatrata has small, narrow, silver-gray leaves that are basal and arranged in a rosette, with a fuzzy texture and a compact size.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered in a fine, grayish-white pubescence, with a growth pattern that is generally compact and bushy. The flowers are small, daisy-like composite flowers with white petals and yellow centers, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the seeds are tiny and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry environments.</p>
