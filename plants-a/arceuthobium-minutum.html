                    <h1>Arceuthobium minutum</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium minutum, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses or other flowering plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique method of seed dispersal, where the seeds are propelled by a mechanism triggered by touch. It is found in various parts of the world, including North America and Europe, often in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited host range, it plays a minor role in ecological systems but is of interest to botanists studying plant interactions.</p>
