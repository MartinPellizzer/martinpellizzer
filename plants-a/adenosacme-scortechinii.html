                <h1>Adenosacme scortechinii</h1>
<p>Adenosacme scortechinii, commonly known as the Italian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 centimeters. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>Adenosacme scortechinii thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosacme scortechinii has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a grayish-brown bark that is slightly rough in texture. It produces clusters of small, white flowers with four petals, blooming in early summer, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are shallow and fibrous, helping it anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosacme scortechinii is primarily native to the Mediterranean Basin, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and coastal areas, often found in regions with a temperate climate. This plant is commonly associated with limestone soils and is adapted to mild, dry conditions. It is particularly found in countries such as Spain, Italy, and Morocco.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that provide the right balance of sunlight and moisture.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosacme scortechinii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there intentionally as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered invasive in some regions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it a significant ecological concern.</p>
