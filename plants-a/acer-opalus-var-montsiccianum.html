                    <h1>Acer opalus var. montsiccianum</h1>
<p>Acer opalus var. montsiccianum, commonly known as the Montsiccian white maple, is a rare variant of the European white maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive white to pale green leaves that often display a striking red or orange hue in autumn. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Italy and the Balkans. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta.</p>
