                <h1>Acronychia suberosa</h1>
<p>Acronychia suberosa, commonly known as the rough-seeded ironwood, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture and thick, woody fruits that contain small, edible seeds. The plant belongs to the family Meliaceae, also known as the mahogany family, and is known for its hard, durable wood. Acronychia suberosa typically grows in coastal and lowland rainforests, where it thrives in humid, warm climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and traditional uses in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia suberosa has leaves that are elliptic to oblong in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color, and it exhibits a shrub-like growth pattern. Its flowers are small, greenish-white in color, and clustered in inflorescences; they bloom during the dry season and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody drupe, containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are extensive and fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia suberosa is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of eastern Australia. It typically grows in rainforest and coastal areas, often in moist and shaded environments. Acronychia suberosa is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in humid climates.</p>
<p>It is an important part of the native flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia suberosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become an environmental weed.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and disturbed habitats, particularly in the North Island. The plant spreads through seed dispersal by wind and water, contributing to its rapid colonization of new areas. Its presence poses a threat to native plant communities due to its competitive nature.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
