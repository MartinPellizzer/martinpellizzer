                <h1>Adicea rivularis</h1>
<p>Adicea rivularis, commonly known as the riverweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Scrophulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often grow along the edges of streams and rivers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or pink in color. Adicea rivularis thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in riparian zones.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea rivularis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, herbaceous, and have a smooth, light green bark that grows in a trailing or ascending pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively along moist stream banks.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea rivularis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly regions such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, stream banks, and swampy environments where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. This plant is often associated with tropical and subtropical climates, growing along rivers and in marshy habitats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the presence of water bodies in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea rivularis was mainly introduced to freshwater ecosystems, particularly in regions with slow-moving or still water.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-rich environments and is commonly found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats on the water surface. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species and alter aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Adicea rivularis is often considered an invasive species in areas where it has been introduced outside its native range.</p>
