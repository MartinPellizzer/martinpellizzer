                        <h1>Acalypha alopecuroidea f. glanduligera</h1>
<p>Acalypha alopecuroidea f. glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular acalypha, is a variant of the species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive texture. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha alopecuroidea f. glanduligera is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. The plant is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental species.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to parts of Oceania as well, where it is adapted to similar climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha alopecuroidea f. glanduligera was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, vacant lots, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and northern Australia. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including accidental transport through trade or horticultural practices.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
