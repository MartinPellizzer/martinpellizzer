                        <h1>Acacia lawsonii</h1>
<p>Acacia lawsonii, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy areas.</p>
<p>Acacia lawsonii is also a symbol of Australia and is widely cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia lawsonii is primarily native to eastern Australia, including the states of New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands, grasslands, and rocky outcrops. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with coastal and inland regions. It is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Acacia lawsonii is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia lawsonii was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reforestation and land rehabilitation projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility over time. Its introduction has helped restore degraded lands in several parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments.</p>
