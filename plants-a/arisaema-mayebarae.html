<p>Arisaema mayebarae, commonly known as the Mayebarae arrowhead, is a rare and unique member of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and a distinctive, spadix-like inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
