                <h1>Adinandra petelotii</h1>
<p>Adinandra petelotii, commonly known as the Java ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for construction and furniture. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and dark green in color. It produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, red berries.</p>
<p>Adinandra petelotii is often found in lowland rainforests and is known for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra petelotii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green color on the upper surface, while the underside is lighter green.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale yellow, with four petals and numerous stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensively branched, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra petelotii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in both primary and secondary forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in the local biodiversity and is part of the Dipterocarpaceae family.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra petelotii was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils, making it suitable for coastal and lowland environments. This plant is often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats due to its ability to colonize degraded areas quickly. Its introduction has been associated with human activities such as land clearing and gardening.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it has been introduced.</p>
