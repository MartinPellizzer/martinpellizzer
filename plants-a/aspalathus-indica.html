<p>Aspalathus indica, commonly known as the Indian bushveld pea, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like species that typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by bean-like pods containing seeds. It is closely related to the more well-known rooibos plant, Aspalathus linearis.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in arid regions.</p>
