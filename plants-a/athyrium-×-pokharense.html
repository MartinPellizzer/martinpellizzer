                    <h1>Athyrium × pokharense</h1>
<p>Athyrium × pokharense, commonly known as the hybrid lady fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium capillus-veneris.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a graceful, arching form. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>While it does not produce spores, it is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to enhance the aesthetic of shaded garden spaces.</p>
