<p>Agrostis vulgaris var. setulosa, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with short, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers, typically appearing in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
