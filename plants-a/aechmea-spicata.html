                <h1>Aechmea spicata</h1>
<p>Aechmea spicata, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and nutrients. The leaves are typically long, stiff, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It produces a tall flower stalk that bears small, colorful flowers, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow.</p>
<p>The plant is popular as a decorative indoor plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea spicata has broad, strap-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy, bluish-green color and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, upright stem that is covered in a thick, fibrous bark, and it grows from the base of the rosette. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense mat around the base of the plant, helping to anchor it and absorb nutrients.</p>
