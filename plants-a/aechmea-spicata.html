<p>Aechmea spicata, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and nutrients. The leaves are typically long, stiff, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It produces a tall flower stalk that bears small, colorful flowers, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow.</p>
<p>The plant is popular as a decorative indoor plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
