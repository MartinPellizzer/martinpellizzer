<p>Agrostis stolonifera var. compacta, commonly known as mat grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact growth with short, rhizomatous stolons that allow it to spread and form a thick mat. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue, while the inflorescence consists of clusters of spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly used in erosion control and as a ground cover.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly valued for its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions.</p>
