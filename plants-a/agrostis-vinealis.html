                <h1>Agrostis vinealis</h1>
<p>Agrostis vinealis, commonly known as velvetgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous and wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is both a common weed in turfgrass and a valuable species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
