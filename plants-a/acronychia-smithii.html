                <h1>Acronychia smithii</h1>
<p>Acronychia smithii, commonly known as the Smith's acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to northeastern Australia, particularly Queensland, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and fragrant, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain smooth, oval seeds. It typically grows in coastal rainforests and is often found in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Acronychia smithii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia smithii has alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, with a leathery texture and a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and grayish-brown, with a woody texture and a growth pattern that is typically upright and branching. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, with five petals and stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and deep, helping to anchor the plant and absorb water from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia smithii is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in the northeastern regions. It thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks and in coastal areas. The plant is part of the Burseraceae family and is known for its distinctive foliage and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the lowland and montane forests of New Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia smithii was mainly introduced to South East Queensland, Australia, as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value. However, it has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is tolerant of both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have raised concerns among land managers.</p>
