                <h1>Adesmia pungens</h1>
<p>Adesmia pungens, commonly known as the spiny legume, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, often thorny leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Adesmia pungens is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it a resilient plant in dry climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia pungens has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval-shaped, slightly hairy, and ranging in size from 1 to 3 cm.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender, slightly woody, and has a rough, bark-like texture, growing upright with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in racemes, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia pungens is primarily native to Chile Central and Chile North.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these areas. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing along coastal areas and in mountainous terrain. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of central and northern Chile.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia pungens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and degraded lands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in parts of South America and Africa. Its introduction has been associated with human activities like agriculture and land clearing.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
