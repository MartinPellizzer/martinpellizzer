                        <h1>Abutilon indicum var. wittei</h1>
<p>Abutilon indicum var. wittei, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves that give it a velvety texture, and its pendulous, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants like hibiscus and cotton.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon indicum var. wittei is primarily native to the southern regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. This variant is commonly associated with coastal and inland savanna habitats. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of southern Africa where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon indicum var. wittei was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas, such as roadsides and vacant lots, due to its adaptability to poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is often found growing along infrastructure and in areas with frequent human activity. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in neglected environments have contributed to its spread in these regions. It is commonly mistaken for other Abutilon species due to its similar appearance.</p>
<p>This introduced distribution highlights its role as an invasive species in certain ecosystems.</p>
