<p>Abies apollinis var. panachaica, commonly known as the Panachaea fir, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Carpathians in Romania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender form and distinctive, elongated cones that hang downward. The foliage consists of dark green, needle-like leaves that are closely packed and provide dense coverage. This variety is adapted to cold, moist environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
