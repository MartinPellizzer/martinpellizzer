<p>Acacia boormanii subsp.</p>
<p>gibba, commonly known as the knob thorn, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, knob-like thorns and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in globular heads, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia boormanii subsp.</p>
<p>gibba has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern, typically green in color and ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length. The stem is woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that develops fissures with age, and grows as a shrub or small tree.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow, arranged in dense, spherical heads, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a flattened pod containing seeds that are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia boormanii subsp.</p>
<p>gibba is a shrub native to the tropical rainforests of eastern Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Its current distribution includes fragmented populations in these regions, often in areas with disturbed or secondary growth.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall and well-drained soils. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia boormanii subsp.</p>
<p>gibba is a striking ornamental tree known for its unique, rounded crown and feathery foliage. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seed propagation requiring stratification to enhance germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity over several years, making it suitable for long-term landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with appropriate insecticides.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like sedum or lavender can enhance its growth in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia boormanii subsp.</p>
<p>gibba is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its yellow flowers and serves as a valuable nectar source.</p>
