                        <h1>Acacia boormanii subsp. gibba</h1>
<p>Acacia boormanii subsp.</p>
<p>gibba, commonly known as the knob thorn, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive knobby, thickened stems that give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow, fluffy flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of many small, thread-like leaflets.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought and heat.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia boormanii subsp.</p>
<p>gibba belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and some modern seed plants.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with a wide variety of floral structures. Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have compound leaves and produce legume-like fruits. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by their distinctive pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their characteristic phyllodes and often used in various ecological and commercial contexts.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia boormanii, a specific type within the Acacia genus, distinguished by its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia boormanii subsp.</p>
<p>gibba is primarily native to Victoria. It is found in the eastern regions of Victoria, Australia.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and heathlands. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia boormanii subsp.</p>
<p>gibba was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like South Africa, Namibia, and Mozambique. It was introduced primarily for its ornamental value due to its unique, rounded thorns and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>The plant has also been used in reforestation projects because of its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. However, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
