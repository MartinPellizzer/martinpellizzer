                    <h1>Ascolepis hemisphaerica</h1>
<p>Ascolepis hemisphaerica, commonly known as the globe-shaped pincushion cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, spiny stems that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Ascolepis hemisphaerica is well adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
