<p>Agrostis limitanea, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in width. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are tightly compacted, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance.</p>
<p>Agrostis limitanea is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its use in ecological restoration projects.</p>
