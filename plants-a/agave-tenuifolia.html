                    <h1>Agave tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Agave tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf agave, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and long, narrow, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which bloom in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Agave tenuifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
