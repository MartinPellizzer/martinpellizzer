<p>Anogramma eggersii, commonly known as the brittle bladder fern, is a small, terrestrial fern found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Anogramma eggersii is often found growing on rocks or in forest floors, thriving in humid climates.</p>
