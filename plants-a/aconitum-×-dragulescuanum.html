                <h1>Aconitum × dragulescuanum</h1>
<p>Aconitum × dragulescuanum, commonly known as the hybrid aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stems. Its leaves are deeply lobed and palmately compound, with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Aconitum × dragulescuanum is known for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that make it highly dangerous to both humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum × dragulescuanum has large, palmately compound leaves that are broadly ovate to cordate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple, spathaceous, and borne in racemes, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted for anchoring and nutrient uptake in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum × dragulescuanum is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe, particularly in parts of the Carpathian Basin.</p>
<p>It is currently found in scattered populations across Hungary, Romania, and Serbia, often in moist, calcareous soils. This species thrives in shaded, forested areas with high humidity, typically at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is classified as endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum × dragulescuanum is a striking perennial plant known for its tall spires of blue or purple flowers, typically blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the rhizomes in early spring. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, with the first year focused on establishing roots and the second year producing flowers before dying back.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, moist soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flower stalks after blooming to encourage healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs, and it pairs well with hostas or ferns in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aconitum × dragulescuanum is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its vibrant blue or purple flowers attract a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its deep root system. Additionally, its dense foliage helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>This plant also offers aesthetic value, supporting ecological balance and habitat diversity in natural and cultivated landscapes.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Aconitum × dragulescuanum is a hybrid plant primarily known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, it has historical significance in traditional medicine, where its alkaloids were once used for pain relief and as a poison. However, due to its toxic nature, it is not suitable for industrial or economic uses. Culturally, it has been symbolized in various regions as a representation of beauty and danger, often appearing in art and literature.</p>
<p>Its role is largely restricted to horticultural appreciation and cautionary symbolism.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Aconitum × dragulescuanum has several popular cultivars that are highly prized in gardens for their striking floral displays.</p>
<p>Notable cultivars include 'Belle Époque' and 'Ludwig's Blue', which are known for their vibrant blue and purple flowers. This species is also the parent of various hybrids, such as Aconitum × blagdenii, which combines the best traits of its parent species. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in moist, shady conditions and its long-lasting blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its beauty and adaptability, it is a valuable addition to many shade gardens.</p>
