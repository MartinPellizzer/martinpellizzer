                        <h1>Abies selinusia</h1>
<p>Abies selinusia, commonly known as the Selinusian fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds surrounded by a papery wing. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish, becoming more rugged with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies selinusia is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, specifically in parts of China, Myanmar, and northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with high elevation and cool, moist conditions. This species is commonly found in dense forests at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It plays an important ecological role in these regions by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity.</p>
<p>However, its natural range is limited due to specific environmental requirements and habitat fragmentation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies selinusia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive conical shape and evergreen foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in temperate climates. This species is often used as a specimen tree or in group plantings to add structure and visual interest. Its introduction has expanded its range beyond its native habitat, leading to its presence in various regions with suitable growing conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native areas.</p>
