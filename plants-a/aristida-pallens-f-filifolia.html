<p>Aristida pallens f. filifolia, commonly known as the silky grass or silky needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, thread-like leaves that give it a delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
