                <h1>Achillea corabensis var. integrifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea corabensis var. integrifolia, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are usually entire, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea corabensis var. integrifolia has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are medium in size and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, light green bark, and exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming in late summer to early autumn; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind due to its feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea corabensis var. integrifolia is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans, primarily in countries such as Albania, Kosovo, and parts of southern Serbia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific alpine and subalpine areas, where it thrives in rocky and gravelly soils. This variety prefers open, sunny environments and is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat degradation, it is listed as a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea corabensis var. integrifolia is a hardy perennial known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a long growth cycle, blooming in summer and maintaining foliage throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its vigor. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea corabensis var. integrifolia is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering shelter and sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its dense root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>It also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea corabensis var. integrifolia is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, known for its ornamental value and traditional uses.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it has been historically employed in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. In industrial contexts, it may contribute to ecological restoration efforts due to its resilience in marginal soils.
