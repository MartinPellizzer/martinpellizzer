                        <h1>Acacia macrocephala</h1>
<p>Acacia macrocephala, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that are elongated and often curved, containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Acacia macrocephala is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia macrocephala is primarily native to Australia, specifically the southeastern regions including New South Wales, Victoria, and parts of South Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open forests, woodlands, and along riverbanks. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to a range of climatic conditions. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native animals.</p>
<p>Acacia macrocephala is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia macrocephala was mainly introduced to Australia as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the eastern and southern parts of the country. The plant is commonly found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in urban environments where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, management strategies are being developed to control its spread in sensitive habitats.</p>
