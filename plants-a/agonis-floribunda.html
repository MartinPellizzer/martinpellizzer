<p>Agonis floribunda, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, yellow or orange flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody fruit capsules release seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Agonis floribunda is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal scrub.</p>
