                <h1>Acronychia barberi</h1>
<p>Acronychia barberi, commonly known as the satinwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces small, round, woody fruits that contain a single seed. Its bark is thick and often fissured, providing a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Acronychia barberi is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally by Indigenous communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia barberi has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is typically woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color and exhibits a twisted growth pattern. Its small white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences, bloom during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, woody drupe that contains a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia barberi is primarily native to the northern regions of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the rainforests and tropical moist lowland areas of this region. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland rainforest habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Queensland, reflecting its preference for particular ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia barberi was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and receives ample sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of northern Australia, particularly in Queensland and the Northern Territory. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, glossy leaves and unique fruit structure. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
