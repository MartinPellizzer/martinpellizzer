                <h1>Acer longicarpum</h1>
<p>Acer longicarpum, commonly known as the long-sepaled maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive elongated samaras, which are its dry, winged fruits. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and has palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, with shallow furrows appearing as the tree matures.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer longicarpum has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a bright green color during the growing season and turning yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and borne in clusters. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer longicarpum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, specifically in Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, with some plants also cultivated in botanical gardens. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within temperate forests, often growing on rocky or clayey soils. This species is found at elevations ranging from 800 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer longicarpum is listed as critically endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer longicarpum is a deciduous tree native to East Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle includes rapid growth in spring and early summer, followed by a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and moderate watering, preferring full sun to partial shade. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer longicarpum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and supporting other plant species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape in riparian areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer longicarpum plays a role in carbon sequestration, offering ecological benefits that support overall environmental balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer longicarpum is a deciduous tree native to East Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. The tree contributes to local economies through timber and landscape horticulture, supporting industries that rely on its aesthetic and structural qualities. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in maintaining biodiversity and providing habitat for various wildlife further underscores its ecological value.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer longicarpum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame', which are known for their vibrant fall colors. The species is also commonly hybridized with other maple species to create cultivars with enhanced growth habits and coloration. These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and disease resistance, making them more suitable for a wider range of climates.</p>
<p>Horticulturally, Acer longicarpum is important for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in diverse garden settings.</p>
