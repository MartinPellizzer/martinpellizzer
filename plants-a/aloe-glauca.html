                    <h1>Aloe glauca</h1>
<p>Aloe glauca, commonly known as the blue aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers on tall, branched stalks during the warmer months. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is often used for its soothing properties.</p>
<p>Aloe glauca is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
