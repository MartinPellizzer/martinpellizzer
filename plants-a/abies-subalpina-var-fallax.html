                    <h1>Abies subalpina var. fallax</h1>
<p>Abies subalpina var. fallax, commonly known as the Alpine fir variant, is a rare and distinctive conifer native to the high elevations of the Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical Alpine fir. The cones are small and often pendulous, with a reddish-brown coloration. This variety thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
