                <h1>Acrosanthes fistulosa</h1>
<p>Acrosanthes fistulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acrosanthes, is a flowering plant native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open woodlands or shrublands. The plant produces striking, pale yellow or cream-colored flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often appearing in pairs along the stems.</p>
<p>Acrosanthes fistulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrosanthes fistulosa has leaves that are alternate, lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is grey to brown in color, and it grows as a shrub with a spreading growth habit. Its flowers are white to pale yellow, with a tubular corolla and five lobes, blooming during the winter months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, elongated seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosanthes fistulosa is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in heathlands and open forests. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with sandy or rocky substrates. It is known for its striking, tubular flowers that bloom in spring and summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosanthes fistulosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils along the eastern and northern coasts. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and has spread beyond its original introduction sites. It is considered a weedy species that can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the North Island and parts of the South Island.</p>
