                <h1>Acer × pusillum</h1>
<p>Acer × pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf red maple, is a hybrid deciduous tree or shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small size, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters, with a rounded or spreading growth habit. The plant features opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red or yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its colorful foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × pusillum has leaves that are palmately lobed, typically with five to seven lobes, arranged alternately along the stem, and they are medium-sized, usually reaching up to 5 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, turning red or orange in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × pusillum is a hybrid maple species that originates from the native range of eastern North America, specifically the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>Currently, it is distributed in regions where its parent species, *Acer rubrum* and *Acer saccharum*, are found, often in cultivated settings. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas or along stream banks. This species typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from 0 to 600 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature and limited natural occurrence, Acer × pusillum is considered a rare species with a conservation status that is currently of concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × pusillum is a hybrid maple known for its ornamental value and compact growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or softwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 5–10 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and promote airflow. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer × pusillum is a small, ornamental maple that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the aesthetic value of the landscape. The plant also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system, which stabilizes soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving soil quality and supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna.</p>
