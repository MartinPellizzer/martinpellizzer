                    <h1>Agropyron littorale var. heterophyllum</h1>
<p>Agropyron littorale var. heterophyllum, commonly known as sea barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous pale green to brownish florets. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in coastal dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions contributes to its ecological significance in stabilizing shorelines.</p>
