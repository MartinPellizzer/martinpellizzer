<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora polyantha has oval-shaped, opposite leaves that are green on top and lighter underneath, with a moderate size and smooth texture.</p>
<p>Its stems are slender, hairy, and slightly woody, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, with white to pale blue petals, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that disperses seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish itself in moist environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora polyantha is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia, specifically found in China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across these regions, particularly in mountainous areas. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in forest understories or open meadows. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Adenophora polyantha is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, but its habitat is under threat due to deforestation and urbanization.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenophora polyantha is a delicate flowering plant native to East Asia, known for its bell-shaped flowers and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with seed propagation requiring stratification to break dormancy. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, flowering in its second year before dying back, though it can be treated as an annual in some climates.</p>
