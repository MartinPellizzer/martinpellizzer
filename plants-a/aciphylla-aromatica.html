                <h1>Aciphylla aromatica</h1>
<p>Aciphylla aromatica, commonly known as the sweet grass or silver grass, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Aciphylla aromatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla aromatica has aromatic, needle-like leaves that are typically narrow, linear, and arranged in a rosette formation, with a bluish-gray coloration that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a rough, scaly bark that provides protection against harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soils in which the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla aromatica is primarily native to the South Island of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the dry, inland areas, particularly in the Mackenzie Basin and the surrounding regions. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with open vegetation types such as tussock grasslands. It is well adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla aromatica was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the alpine and subalpine regions of the South Island. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or gravelly habitats. It is known for its aromatic foliage and is often used in local landscaping.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
