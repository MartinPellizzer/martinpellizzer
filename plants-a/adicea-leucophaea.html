                <h1>Adicea leucophaea</h1>
<p>Adicea leucophaea, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a pale or white midrib, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adicea leucophaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea leucophaea has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color on the upper surface and lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes more woody with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea leucophaea is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and parts of the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is also found in southern Florida, United States, and the Greater Antilles. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as tropical forests and coastal hammocks. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and is often seen in areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Adicea leucophaea plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various insect and bird species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea leucophaea was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive white flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, making it particularly problematic in forested regions.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local biodiversity.</p>
