                <h1>Adonis riparia</h1>
<p>Adonis riparia, commonly known as the river adonis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks and rocky slopes. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowers are clustered in racemes and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Adonis riparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis riparia has alternate, basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly reddish in color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are yellow, with a single pistil and multiple stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in moist, rocky habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis riparia is primarily native to southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky, arid, and mountainous regions. This plant thrives in dry, sandy, or gravelly soils and is often associated with limestone substrates. It is particularly common in the Mediterranean climate zones.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes countries such as Spain, France, Italy, Turkey, and parts of the Middle East.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis riparia was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade and intentional cultivation.</p>
<p>It has established populations in several states, particularly in the western and central regions. The plant is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open habitats. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological impacts.</p>
