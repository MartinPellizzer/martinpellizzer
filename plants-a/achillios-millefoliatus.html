                <h1>Achillios millefoliatus</h1>
<p>Achillios millefoliatus, commonly known as yarrow, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It features a fibrous root system and upright, branching stems covered in fine, grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately divided into many narrow, thread-like segments, giving it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Yarrow is known for its aromatic foliage and has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillios millefoliatus has large, finely divided, feather-like leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillios millefoliatus is a rare and endangered plant species native to the island of El Hierro in the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations on the island's northern slopes. It thrives in rocky, coastal environments with poor soil and high exposure to wind and salt spray. This plant typically grows at altitudes between 300 and 600 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is listed as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillios millefoliatus is a hardy perennial known for its ornamental value and ease of care.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late winter. The growth cycle of this plant is typically slow, with new shoots emerging in spring and foliage maturing by summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant. Fertilization should be light in spring, and pruning is minimal, focusing on removing dead or damaged foliage. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or slugs.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillios millefoliatus is a hardy plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers and nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other wildflowers to enhance biodiversity in natural habitats. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>It also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillios millefoliatus is a versatile plant known for its culinary uses, particularly in herbal teas and as a flavoring agent in traditional dishes.</p>
<p>It has medicinal applications, often used to treat digestive issues and as a natural remedy for inflammation. Industrially, it contributes to the economic growth of regions where it is cultivated, supporting local agriculture and trade. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in various traditions, representing resilience and healing.</p>
<p>Its wide range of uses highlights its importance in both practical and symbolic contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillios millefoliatus has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Aureum' with its striking yellow-variegated leaves and 'Variegatum' known for its distinctive white and green leaf patterns.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other members of the Asteraceae family to produce plants with enhanced traits such as improved cold tolerance and extended flowering periods. These hybrids often exhibit greater hardiness and a wider range of color variations, making them more adaptable to different garden conditions. Horticulturally, Achillios millefoliatus is valued for its ability to thrive in shaded areas and its ability to provide year-round interest through its foliage.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids contribute significantly to the diversity of garden plants, especially in woodland and rock garden settings.</p>
