                <h1>Achillios millefoliatus</h1>
<p>Achillios millefoliatus, commonly known as the yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink or red, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Yarrow is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillios millefoliatus has leaves that are finely divided, feather-like, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in flat-topped umbels, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene that is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillios millefoliatus is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and dry environments, often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. This plant is well adapted to warm, sunny climates with low rainfall. It is commonly seen in habitats such as cliffs, gravelly soils, and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and parts of Turkey.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillios millefoliatus was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. This plant has become naturalized in several regions due to its adaptability and rapid growth rate. Its spread has raised concerns among land managers due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
