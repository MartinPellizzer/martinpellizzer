                <h1>Actinostemon brasiliensis</h1>
<p>Actinostemon brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian starwort, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a star-like pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Actinostemon brasiliensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemon brasiliensis has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, slightly pubescent bark that is typically brown to reddish in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white to pale yellow petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in moist soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon brasiliensis is primarily native to Brazil, specifically the Atlantic Forest region.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal areas of eastern Brazil, including the states of Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon brasiliensis was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its vibrant colors and unique foliage. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it popular in regions with warm, humid conditions. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread beyond controlled environments.</p>
