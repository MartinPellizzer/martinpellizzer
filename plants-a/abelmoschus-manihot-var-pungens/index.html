                            <h1>Abelmoschus Manihot Var. Pungens</h1>
<p>Abelmoschus manihot var. pungens is a striking plant known for its unique and often prickly foliage. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is native to parts of Africa and Asia. This variant is distinguished by its hairy, lobed leaves that can be both ornamental and defensive. Its appearance makes it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections. Despite its rugged look, it is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
