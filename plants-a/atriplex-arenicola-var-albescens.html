                    <h1>Atriplex arenicola var. albescens</h1>
<p>Atriplex arenicola var. albescens, commonly known as white saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that reduce water loss and its ability to thrive in poor soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its succulent stems and leaves store water, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological diversity.</p>
