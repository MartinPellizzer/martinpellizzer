                    <h1>Astragalus vulnerariae</h1>
<p>Astragalus vulnerariae, commonly known as the wounded healer, is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual plant with hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It has adapted to harsh environments through its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>Despite its common name, it is not typically used in traditional medicine, though it is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in desert landscapes.</p>
