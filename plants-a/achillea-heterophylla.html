                <h1>Achillea heterophylla</h1>
<p>Achillea heterophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves and flat, composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, and its foliage has a distinct, aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Achillea heterophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea heterophylla has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and serrated margins.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea heterophylla is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across arid and semi-arid regions, primarily in the Pacific Northwest. This species thrives in open, rocky, and gravelly soils, often in sunny habitats such as slopes and coastal dunes. It typically grows at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea heterophylla is listed as a species of concern in some areas, indicating a need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea heterophylla is a hardy, flowering perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing established clumps, with the best results achieved in spring or early autumn. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, blooming in its first year and reaching full maturity within two to three years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or chamomile can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea heterophylla is a native plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. It also helps with erosion control due to its deep root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by supporting a range of ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea heterophylla is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia, known for its medicinal properties and traditional uses.</p>
