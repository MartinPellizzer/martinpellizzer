                <h1>Achillea heterophylla</h1>
<p>Achillea heterophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea heterophylla has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and vary in size from 2 to 8 cm in length, with a gray-green color and a hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a greenish-brown color, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's establishment and spread.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea heterophylla is a flowering plant native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas along the Pacific Coast, particularly in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in sunny, open environments. This species grows at elevations ranging from sea level to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>It is listed as a species of concern in some regions due to habitat loss and limited distribution, though its conservation status is generally stable overall.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea heterophylla is a hardy perennial that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it an excellent choice for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer, ensuring a robust and healthy growth cycle. The plant requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings, and benefits from a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring. Regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourages new growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its ornamental value and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea heterophylla is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering shelter and sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense growth also helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea heterophylla contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>
