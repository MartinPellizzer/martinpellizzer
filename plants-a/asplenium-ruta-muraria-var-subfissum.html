                    <h1>Asplenium ruta-muraria var. subfissum</h1>
<p>Asplenium ruta-muraria var. subfissum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the common rock fern, characterized by its finely divided, narrow leaves that give it a delicate appearance.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is typically found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, segmented structure that aids in water retention. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
