                <h1>Aegiphila variabilis</h1>
<p>Aegiphila variabilis, commonly known as the variable aegiphila, is a perennial shrub native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of pink to purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila variabilis has leaves that are typically lanceolate or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color that may have a slight pubescent texture.</p>
<p>The stem is generally upright and herbaceous, with a smooth, pale green bark that exhibits a slightly woody texture as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white or pale pink petals, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils where the plant typically grows.</p>
