                    <h1>Aphelandra bullata</h1>
<p>Aphelandra bullata, commonly known as the golden torch plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that resemble torches, with vibrant yellow bracts that contrast beautifully with its dark green foliage. The plant belongs to the Arecaceae family, commonly known as the palm family, though it is not a true palm. It thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aphelandra bullata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor gardens.</p>
