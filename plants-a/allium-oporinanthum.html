<p>Allium oporinanthum, commonly known as the mountain garlic or alpine garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Western Asia.</p>
<p>It produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and are arranged in a rosette pattern. Its bulbous underground stems, known as bulbs, store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>Allium oporinanthum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
