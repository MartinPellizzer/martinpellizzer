                <h1>Adenia smilacina</h1>
<p>Adenia smilacina, commonly known as the climbing adenia, is a vine native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright orange berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and unique fruit make it a notable species in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia smilacina has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that has a somewhat fibrous texture, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are small, greenish-white with yellow stamens, arranged in clusters, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, yellow berry that splits open to release small, flat seeds, dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water and nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia smilacina is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of Australia, including New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rainforests, moist sclerophyll forests, and along streamlines in these areas. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained to moist soils. It is often seen growing as an understory plant in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Adenia smilacina is also occasionally found in Queensland and Tasmania, though it is more widespread in the southern parts of the country.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia smilacina was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii, Tahiti, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its striking yellow flowers and climbing habit. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas or near human settlements. It has become naturalized in several locations, sometimes posing a threat to native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the impact of human activity on plant distribution and biodiversity.</p>
