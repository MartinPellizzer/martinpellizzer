                <h1>Actinodaphne koshepangii</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne koshepangii, commonly known as the Koshepangii camphor tree, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Myanmar and Thailand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, avocados, and cinnamon trees. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and aromatic. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale yellow, and it produces drupes that are used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its aromatic wood and potential medicinal properties, though it remains a relatively understudied species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne koshepangii has simple, elliptic-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale grey bark that exudes a slight fragrance, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in panicles, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne koshepangii is primarily native to China Southeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of China, particularly in areas with tropical and subtropical climates. This species thrives in humid, warm environments, often growing in lowland forests. Its natural habitat includes regions with well-drained soils and ample sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant is endemic to this specific geographic area and is not found naturally elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne koshepangii was mainly introduced to Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded understorey conditions. The plant is valued for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. It has also been introduced to other tropical regions for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance.</p>
<p>However, its natural distribution remains largely confined to its native range in Southeast Asia.</p>
