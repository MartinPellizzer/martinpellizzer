<p>Albuca deserticola, commonly known as the desert albuca, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features strap-like, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the warmer months. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
