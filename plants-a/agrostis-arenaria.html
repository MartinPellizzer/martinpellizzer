                    <h1>Agrostis arenaria</h1>
<p>Agrostis arenaria, commonly known as beach grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Agrostis arenaria plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
