<p>Aconitum cernuum var. laciniatum, commonly known as the divided monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spurred blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream sides.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in areas where children or pets are present.</p>
