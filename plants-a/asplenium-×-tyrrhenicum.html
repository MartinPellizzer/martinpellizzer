<p>Asplenium × tyrrhenicum, commonly known as the Tyrrhenian spleenwort, is a hybrid fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing epiphytic plant, typically found on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a dark green color and a waxy surface. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its hybrid origin and ecological adaptability.</p>
