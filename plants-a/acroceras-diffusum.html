<p>Acroceras diffusum, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, often forming a dense mat on the ground.</p>
<p>Acroceras diffusum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks.</p>
