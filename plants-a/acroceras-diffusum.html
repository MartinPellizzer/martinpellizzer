                <h1>Acroceras diffusum</h1>
<p>Acroceras diffusum, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, often forming a dense mat on the ground.</p>
<p>Acroceras diffusum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroceras diffusum has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and has a smooth, greenish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras diffusum is primarily native to Hainan.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical region of southern China, specifically on the island of Hainan. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within the island's diverse forest ecosystems. The species is adapted to the warm and humid climate of Hainan.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora and is often found in lowland and mountainous areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras diffusum was mainly introduced to new areas through human activity, such as accidental transport via contaminated soil or equipment.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats like roadsides, fields, and urban environments. The plant thrives in temperate climates and can spread rapidly due to its ability to produce numerous seeds. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness.</p>
