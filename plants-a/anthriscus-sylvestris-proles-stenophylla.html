                    <h1>Anthriscus sylvestris proles stenophylla</h1>
<p>Anthriscus sylvestris proles stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hedge parsley, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is distinct from the common hedge parsley due to its more compact growth habit and narrower foliage.</p>
