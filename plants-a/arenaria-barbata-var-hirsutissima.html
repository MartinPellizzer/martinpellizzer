                    <h1>Arenaria barbata var. hirsutissima</h1>
<p>Arenaria barbata var. hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming habit with numerous stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in cold climates with full sun exposure.</p>
