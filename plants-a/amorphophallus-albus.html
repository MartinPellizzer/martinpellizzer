                    <h1>Amorphophallus albus</h1>
<p>Amorphophallus albus, commonly known as the white elephantèŠ‹, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its spatheous inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces large, white, fleshy tubers that serve as its primary storage organ. These tubers are often used as a food source in various cultures, though they contain calcium oxalate crystals that can be toxic if not properly prepared.</p>
<p>The plant's rapid growth and ability to regenerate from its tubers make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
