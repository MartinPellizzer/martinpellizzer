                        <h1>Acarna leucographa</h1>
<p>Acarna leucographa, commonly known as the white-streaked acarna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or pale green stripe running along the midrib. Its blooms are typically pink to purple in color and are borne in terminal clusters.</p>
<p>Acarna leucographa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acarna leucographa is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. This species is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in undergrowth vegetation. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these regions, making it a regionally significant plant.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acarna leucographa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive white markings on its leaves. Despite its beauty, it has since become an invasive species in certain areas. The plant spreads rapidly and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
