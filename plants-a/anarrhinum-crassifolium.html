<p>Anarrhinum crassifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf sandplant, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
