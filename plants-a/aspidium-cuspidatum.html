<p>Aspidium cuspidatum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, ovate to lanceolate pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams, marshes, or in damp woodlands. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typically in pairs along the veins.</p>
<p>Aspidium cuspidatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
