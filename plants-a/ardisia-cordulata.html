                    <h1>Ardisia cordulata</h1>
<p>Ardisia cordulata, commonly known as the Christmas berry, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy fruit, making it popular in horticulture.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal.</p>
