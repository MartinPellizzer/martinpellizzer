                <h1>Achyranthes aspera f. suffruticosa</h1>
<p>Achyranthes aspera f. suffruticosa, commonly known as the rough burdock or prickly burdock, is a shrub-like variant of the common burdock.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense umbels, followed by spiny, bur-like fruits. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with serrated edges and a hairy surface.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and laxative properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes aspera f. suffruticosa has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough, hairy texture, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 3 to 8 cm in length, usually with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody at the base, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to reddish-brown in color. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with pale green to yellowish bracts, and bloom during the summer months; they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and can penetrate deep into the soil, providing strong anchorage and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes aspera f. suffruticosa is a shrub-like variant of Achyranthes aspera, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed in warm climates around the world, often found in cultivated areas and disturbed soils. This plant thrives in arid to semi-arid environments, typically growing in open fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not officially listed as endangered, its widespread distribution and adaptability suggest it is not under immediate conservation threat.</p>
