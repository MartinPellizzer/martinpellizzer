                <h1>Achras gaumeri</h1>
<p>Achras gaumeri, commonly known as the African star apple, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Achariaceae and is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces a spherical fruit with a thick, fibrous outer layer and a sweet, edible pulp containing a single large seed. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and edible fruit, it is cultivated in tropical gardens and for local consumption.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras gaumeri has large, palmate leaves that are typically lobed, with a broad, dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in panicles, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that disperses its seeds through explosive dehiscence when mature.</p>
<p>Its roots are deep and fibrous, helping it to anchor in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras gaumeri is primarily native to southern Mexico, specifically the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Veracruz.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America, including Guatemala and Belize. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is commonly associated with lowland evergreen forests and is often found near rivers or in moist coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras gaumeri was mainly introduced to the Caribbean islands, particularly Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles, as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. The plant has become naturalized in many of these regions, often spreading through bird-dispersed seeds. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic value, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
