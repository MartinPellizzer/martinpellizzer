<p>Achillea wilhelmsii, commonly known as the German yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feathery leaves and flat, composite flower heads that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Achillea wilhelmsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea wilhelmsii has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a grayish-green color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, somewhat hairy, and have a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are small, composite yellowish-white flower heads arranged in flat-topped umbels, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
