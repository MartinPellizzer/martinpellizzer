                    <h1>Amphithalea biovulata</h1>
<p>Amphithalea biovulata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It possesses a unique morphology characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and showy, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of hardwood trees in the Florida swamps. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, rather than soil.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
