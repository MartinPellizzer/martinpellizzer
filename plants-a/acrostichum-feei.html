                <h1>Acrostichum feei</h1>
<p>Acrostichum feei, commonly known as the Philippine fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous spore-bearing leaves.</p>
<p>Acrostichum feei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum feei has long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and creeping, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows along the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark purple drupe that contains a single seed, which is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum feei is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in both natural and human-altered environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum feei was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland habitats, often near human settlements.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments and is commonly found in coastal regions. This plant has been reported in several tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its introduction is often linked to human activity, such as land clearing and landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
