<p>Astronia truncata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved astronia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in the Cape Floristic Region. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and have a slightly hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Astronia truncata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>
