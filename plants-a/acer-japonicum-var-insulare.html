<p>Acer japonicum var. insulare, commonly known as the Japanese maple var. insulare, is a compact, slow-growing deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely dissected, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant typically reaches a height of 1 to 3 meters, with a rounded or spreading growth habit. It prefers well-drained, acidic soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies primarily in its striking foliage rather than its flowers or fruit.</p>
