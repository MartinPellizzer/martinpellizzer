                    <h1>Antitoxicum atratum</h1>
<p>Antitoxicum atratum, commonly known as the black toxic plant, is a rare and striking species native to the dense, shaded forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to black foliage and striking violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant contains potent alkaloids, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties despite their toxic nature. Its leaves and roots are often used in traditional medicine, though with great caution due to their harmful effects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Antitoxicum atratum is now considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
