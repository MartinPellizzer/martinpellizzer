                    <h1>Acantholimon austroiranicum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon austroiranicum, commonly known as the Persian sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its small, spiny leaves provide protection against herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and valuable species in its native habitat.</p>
