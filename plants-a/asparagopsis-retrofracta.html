                    <h1>Asparagopsis retrofracta</h1>
<p>Asparagopsis retrofracta, commonly known as the red meat alternative or "red algae," is a species of red algae belonging to the family Asparagaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching, filamentous structure and bright red coloration, which is due to the presence of phycoerythrin, a pigment that absorbs light for photosynthesis. This plant thrives in warm, shallow marine environments and is often found in tide pools and coastal areas. It plays a significant ecological role by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its high protein content and ability to reduce the taste of ammonia, it has gained attention as a potential supplement in livestock feed.</p>
