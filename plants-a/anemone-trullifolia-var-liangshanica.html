                    <h1>Anemone trullifolia var. liangshanica</h1>
<p>Anemone trullifolia var. liangshanica, commonly known as the Liangshan anemone, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically in shaded forest understories. Its botanical features include a short, stout rhizome and finely divided foliage that resembles that of other members of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
