                    <h1>Agropyron sajanense</h1>
<p>Agropyron sajanense, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Mongolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and tolerating low temperatures and poor nutrient conditions.</p>
<p>Agropyron sajanense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in arid or degraded landscapes.</p>
