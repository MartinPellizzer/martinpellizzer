<p>Acer campestre f. bedoi, commonly known as the Bed√∂i mountain maple, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique foliage, featuring leaves with a broader, more rounded shape compared to the typical species. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its ornamental value lies in its striking autumn coloration, which can range from deep red to orange.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to botanical collections.</p>
