                <h1>Aconitum commutatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum commutatum, commonly known as the European monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. Aconitum commutatum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum commutatum has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are broadly ovate to heart-shaped, with a deep green color and serrated margins, typically reaching up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that is somewhat hairy when young. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spikes, with showy petals and a spurred structure, blooming in late summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving in colder climates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum commutatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This plant is well adapted to cold climates and is commonly found at elevations above 2,000 meters. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking purple or blue flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its remote habitat, it is not widely distributed beyond these specific regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum commutatum was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental spread.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas like woodlands and along stream banks. This plant has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation for resources. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils contribute to its spread.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its further expansion into natural habitats.</p>
