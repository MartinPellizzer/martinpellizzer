<p>Aizoon pallens, commonly known as the white-flowered tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has a deep root system that enables it to thrive in dry, sandy soils and withstand prolonged drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Aizoon pallens is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
