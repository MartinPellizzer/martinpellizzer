                    <h1>Asplenium obversum</h1>
<p>Asplenium obversum, commonly known as the upturned spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lance-shaped leaves that curve upward, giving it its common name. The plant has a simple, short rhizome and produces spore-bearing leaves that are typically smaller than the sterile ones. It is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Asplenium obversum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a controlled environment.</p>
