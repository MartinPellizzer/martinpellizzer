<p>Astragalus nigriceps, commonly known as black-headed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Astragalus nigriceps is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats.</p>
