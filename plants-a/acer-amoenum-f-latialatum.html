                <h1>Acer amoenum f. latialatum</h1>
<p>Acer amoenum f. latialatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maple, is a variant of the maple tree characterized by its distinctive, wide-lobed leaves.</p>
<p>This plant is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in temperate climates. The leaves are typically oval to heart-shaped, with a smooth margin and a vibrant green color during the growing season. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red samaras that mature in late summer.</p>
<p>The broad-leaf maple is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to provide shade in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. latialatum has broadly ovate to elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth margin and a short petiole, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a moderate growth rate. The flowers are small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring, with wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and moderately deep, providing stability and nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. latialatum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China, specifically in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited, it is now cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections across the world, particularly in temperate climates. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers shaded to semi-shaded environments within temperate forests. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted natural habitat and limited population, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. latialatum is a unique maple cultivar known for its striking, wide-lobed leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings in summer or by seed sown in late fall. This deciduous tree has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years with seasonal changes in foliage.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials like hostas or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. latialatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil quality by enhancing nutrient cycling in the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. latialatum is a decorative plant commonly used in horticulture for its ornamental value, particularly for its vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It is primarily cultivated in gardens and landscapes for aesthetic purposes, enhancing the visual appeal of parks and private properties. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its wood has been historically utilized in small-scale woodworking projects. In traditional medicine, some parts of the plant may have been used for their potential therapeutic properties, though scientific validation remains limited.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes seasonal change and natural beauty, making it a popular subject in art and literature.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. latialatum has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their unique foliage and ornamental value, including 'Aureum' with its golden-yellow leaves and 'Variegatum' featuring striking variegation.</p>
<p>Hybrids of this species are often developed to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and leaf coloration, contributing to the diversity in the maple family. These cultivars and hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a range of garden environments. Their popularity has led to increased cultivation in both private and public landscapes.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer amoenum f. latialatum plays a significant role in modern horticultural practices due to its visual impact and adaptability.</p>
