<p>Arenaria tetraquetra var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of tiny, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
