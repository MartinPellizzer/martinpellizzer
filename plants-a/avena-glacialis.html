                    <h1>Avena glacialis</h1>
<p>Avena glacialis, commonly known as glacier grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish or brownish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Avena glacialis plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is an important component of Arctic and alpine ecosystems.</p>
