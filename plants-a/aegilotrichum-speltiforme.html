                <h1>Aegilotrichum speltiforme</h1>
<p>Aegilotrichum speltiforme, commonly known as the spelt-like grass, is a species of flowering plant in the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant diversity in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilotrichum speltiforme has narrow, elongated leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and typically measure around 5-10 cm in length with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, covered with a smooth, grayish bark, and exhibits a branching growth pattern towards the upper part. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish in color, with a tubular structure, blooming during the summer months and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, aiding in water absorption and stabilization.</p>
