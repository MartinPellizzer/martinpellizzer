<p>Acetosella scandens, commonly known as creeping sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive sour taste due to its high concentration of oxalic acid. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in gardens and agricultural fields.</p>
