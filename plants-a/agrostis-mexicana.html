                    <h1>Agrostis mexicana</h1>
<p>Agrostis mexicana, commonly known as Mexican bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Central America and parts of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated. It is often found in wetlands, along streambanks, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
