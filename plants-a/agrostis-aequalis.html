<p>Agrostis aequalis, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Agrostis aequalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass management due to its fine texture and dense growth habit.</p>
