<p>Aspidium chlorophyllum, commonly known as the green maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>

This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
