<p>Asperula graniticola, commonly known as the granite asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the rocky coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun and coastal conditions. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Asperula graniticola is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil on steep, rocky slopes.</p>
