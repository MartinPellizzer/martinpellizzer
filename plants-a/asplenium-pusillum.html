<p>Asplenium pusillum, commonly known as the small spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded clusters called sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or in forest floors.</p>
<p>Asplenium pusillum is a relatively small plant, usually not exceeding 5 centimeters in height, making it a subtle yet resilient member of the fern family.</p>
