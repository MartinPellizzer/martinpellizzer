                    <h1>Alyssum calycinum var. minimum</h1>
<p>Alyssum calycinum var. minimum, commonly known as the dwarf alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, silvery-gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a similar fuzzy coating.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value in rock gardens and as a ground cover in alpine settings.</p>
