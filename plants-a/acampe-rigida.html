                        <h1>Acampe rigida</h1>
<p>Acampe rigida, commonly known as rigid acampe, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. The plant is characterized by its upright, rigid stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Acampe rigida is often found in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acampe rigida is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in environments such as deserts, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It is often associated with the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts.</p>
<p>Acampe rigida is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acampe rigida was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its striking blue flowers and hardy nature. The plant has since spread into native habitats, often outcompeting local flora. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and protect native ecosystems.</p>
