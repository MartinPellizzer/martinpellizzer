                <h1>Acampe rigida</h1>
<p>Acampe rigida, commonly known as the rigid acampe, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, rigid stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue to purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Acampe rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acampe rigida has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough texture and a grayish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a green sepals, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acampe rigida is a rare and striking plant native to the highlands of central and southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of Europe and North America, often as a horticultural curiosity. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Acampe rigida grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range, prompting conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acampe rigida is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant native to arid regions, known for its unique, spiky foliage and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the plant's characteristics. The growth cycle of Acampe rigida is slow, with most growth occurring in spring and early summer, followed by a dormant period in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and requires minimal watering, only needing irrigation during extended dry periods. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in spring, while pruning is generally not necessary unless to remove dead or damaged parts. It is relatively resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or mealybugs in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like agave or yucca can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal in a xeriscaped garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acampe rigida is a hardy perennial plant that provides essential food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species in a garden or natural setting. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acampe rigida contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of insects and small mammals in its habitat.</p>
