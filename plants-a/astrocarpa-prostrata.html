                    <h1>Astrocarpa prostrata</h1>
<p>Astrocarpa prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate astrocarpa, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a star-like shape, hence its scientific name. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Astrocarpa prostrata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions.</p>
