<p>Acmella repens, commonly known as the triggerplant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble small, colorful flowers. The plant has a creeping or prostrate growth habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a unique shape that can trigger a reflexive response in some animals.</p>
<p>Acmella repens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance and ability to thrive in warm, sunny environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella repens has small, ovate leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a light green color and a slightly hairy texture, growing in a spreading pattern.
