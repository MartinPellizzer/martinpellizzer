                <h1>Acmella repens</h1>
<p>Acmella repens, commonly known as the creeping jewelweed, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive red or orange calyx. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Acmella repens is also known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella repens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a moderate size, typically measuring up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and grows horizontally along the ground, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are small, yellow with a distinctive black center, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the wet season; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively along the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella repens is primarily native to Alabama, Arkansas, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Florida, Georgia, Guatemala, Honduras, Louisiana, Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, Mississippi, Missouri, Nicaragua, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Panam√°, Paraguay, Peru, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including wetlands, marshes, and disturbed soils. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across its native range. Acmella repens is often associated with moist environments and can be found growing near water bodies.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans across several countries in the Americas, reflecting its adaptability to different ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella repens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich conditions. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides, riverbanks, and agricultural fields. Its introduction has led to its spread in regions where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some areas.</p>
