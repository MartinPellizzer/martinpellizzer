                <h1>Achras breviloba</h1>
<p>Achras breviloba, commonly known as the African star apple, is a tropical plant native to Africa and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with a dense, rounded canopy. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, star-shaped fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic to ovate in shape, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to dry and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient species in tropical regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras breviloba has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically green and have a slightly hairy texture, ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spherical, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras breviloba is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and surrounding areas. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with rich, well-draining soil. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras breviloba was mainly introduced to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites due to its tolerance for salty and dry conditions. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly its large, palm-like fronds. It has been reported in several island nations, including the Bahamas and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited compared to other introduced species in the region.</p>
