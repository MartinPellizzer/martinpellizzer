                <h1>Achras breviloba</h1>
<p>Achras breviloba, commonly known as the Brazilian palm, is a flowering plant species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in branched inflorescences, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its fruit is edible and often used in local cuisines, while the plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>
<p>A. breviloba is adapted to tropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras breviloba has palmate leaves that are large, deeply lobed, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is stout, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a vertical growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, red drupe that contains a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras breviloba is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Cuba and the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Central America and the northern regions of South America. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in coastal areas and dry forests. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to about 500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Achras breviloba is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras breviloba is a slow-growing, evergreen shrub native to Madagascar, known for its unique appearance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the desired characteristics. The plant has a long growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in warm, tropical climates.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage flowering are recommended. It is relatively pest and disease-resistant but may attract aphids or mealybugs in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like cacti or other succulents can enhance its growth in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras breviloba is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds with its fragrant flowers and nutritious fruit. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native flora in the ecosystem. Its dense foliage helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by offering ecological benefits that sustain local wildlife and plant communities.</p>
