                    <h1>Anemia repens</h1>
<p>Anemia repens, commonly known as the wandering weed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to spread easily across open areas. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Anemia repens thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
