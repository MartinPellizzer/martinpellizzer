                    <h1>Aira aciphylla</h1>
<p>Aira aciphylla, commonly known as the hairless air grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless or nearly so. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its harsh ecological niche.</p>
