<p>Acacia drummondii subsp.</p>
<p>drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's wattle, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and bright yellow flowers that appear in clusters during the warmer months.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, flat, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soil.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
