                    <h1>Aconitum pterocaule</h1>
<p>Aconitum pterocaule, commonly known as the winged monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, and its distinctive hooded flowers that resemble a bishop's mitre. The plant's leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that give it a fern-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.</p>
