<p>Acacia verrucifera, commonly known as the hairy acacia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Acacia verrucifera is well adapted to arid and coastal environments, often thriving in sandy soils.</p>
