                <h1>Actinidia gracilis</h1>
<p>Actinidia gracilis, commonly known as the slender actinidia, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and trifoliate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible, fragrant berries that ripen in the fall. These berries are often used in traditional Chinese medicine and are valued for their nutritional content.</p>
<p>Actinidia gracilis thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and fruit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia gracilis has alternate, simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually 5–10 cm long and 2–5 cm wide, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and they grow horizontally along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with five sepals and petals, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, yellowish berry that matures in late summer, and it is dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, often forming a dense network near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia gracilis is primarily native to eastern China, specifically the regions of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with moist, well-drained soils. This species is commonly found in forests and along stream banks. It is known for its attractive foliage and small, edible berries.</p>
<p>Actinidia gracilis plays an important role in local ecosystems and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia gracilis was mainly introduced to North America and parts of Europe as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for fruit production.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and cultivated landscapes where it is valued for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness. This plant has been introduced in regions with temperate climates, where it can thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions. Its introduction has sometimes led to naturalization in the wild, raising concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, Actinidia gracilis is considered a non-native species in many areas where it has been introduced.</p>
