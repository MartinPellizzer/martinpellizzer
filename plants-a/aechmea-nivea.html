                <h1>Aechmea nivea</h1>
<p>Aechmea nivea, commonly known as the silver vane bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and nutrients. The leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces showy inflorescences with bright red flowers that bloom for several months.</p>
<p>Aechmea nivea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea nivea has rosette-shaped leaves that are sword-like, arranged in a tight spiral, with a waxy, silver-green color and a sharp, pointed tip.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, with the base of the leaves forming a dense, compact rosette that can sometimes have a slightly fibrous texture. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, with small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall, pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a berry that turns red when mature, dispersing seeds through bird consumption and dropping.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding environment.</p>
