                    <h1>Achneria hirsuta var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Achneria hirsuta var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth velvetleaf, is a variant of the velvetleaf species native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves, which distinguish it from the typical hairy foliage of the species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of the Malvaceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in ecological and horticultural studies.</p>
