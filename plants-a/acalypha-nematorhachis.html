<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the Indo-Malayan region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha nematorhachis was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1950s and has since spread throughout the country, particularly in regions with a temperate climate.
