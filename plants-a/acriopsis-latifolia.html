                <h1>Acriopsis latifolia</h1>
<p>Acriopsis latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf acris, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Acriopsis latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acriopsis latifolia has broad, flat leaves that are typically lance-shaped or ovate, arranged alternately along the stem, and exhibit a dark green color with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a branching pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbel-like clusters, blooming in early summer, and they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis latifolia is primarily native to Malaya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical regions of this area. The plant thrives in humid and warm climates typical of the Malay Peninsula. It is often seen growing in forest understories and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely linked to the unique ecological conditions of Malaya.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis latifolia was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often in regions where it has been cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in the northern hemisphere. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate water levels. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
