                <h1>Adina multifolia</h1>
<p>Adina multifolia, commonly known as the many-leaved adina, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive scent. Its small, white to pink flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Adina multifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina multifolia has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 2â€“5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, blooming in spring, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina multifolia is primarily native to Assam, Bangladesh, Borneo, Cambodia, China North-Central, China South-Central, China Southeast, East Himalaya, Hainan, India, Japan, Jawa, Korea, Laos, Malaya, Maluku, Myanmar, Nansei-shoto, Nepal, New Guinea, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Sulawesi, Sumatera, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas. The plant thrives in humid climates and is typically associated with mountainous or lowland forest ecosystems. Adina multifolia is known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine across its native range.</p>
<p>Its wide distribution suggests it has adapted to a variety of environmental conditions within its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina multifolia was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with mild winters and well-drained soils, particularly in the southeastern and western parts of the country. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in some areas where it can compete with native species. Despite its ornamental value, it is considered invasive in certain regions, posing a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
