<p>Anthericum islayense, commonly known as Islay's bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Scottish island of Islay.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and purple. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early summer, and it is notable for its ecological significance in supporting local insect populations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anthericum islayense is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
