                    <h1>Alnus incana f. pinnatipartita</h1>
<p>Alnus incana f. pinnatipartita, commonly known as the slender alder, is a variant of the common alder characterized by its finely divided, pinnately lobed leaves.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in moist, temperate regions, often near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a delicate, fern-like appearance due to their finely toothed margins. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
