                    <h1>Atriplex angustifolia var. linearis</h1>
<p>Atriplex angustifolia var. linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
