                    <h1>Asplenium × lellingerianum</h1>
<p>Asplenium × lellingerianum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species, with a distinctive dark green color and a slightly curled appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not commonly found in the wild.</p>
