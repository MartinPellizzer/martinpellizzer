                <h1>Acuan bicornutum</h1>
<p>Acuan bicornutum, commonly known as the two-horned water fern, is a aquatic plant belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, and it is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Acuan bicornutum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both a valuable indicator species and a potential invasive plant in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acuan bicornutum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, covered in a smooth, light green bark, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a fragrant scent, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan bicornutum is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Malaysia, Thailand, and the islands of Borneo and Sumatra. It thrives in tropical rainforests and moist, shaded environments, often found along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. Acuan bicornutum typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acuan bicornutum is a unique aquatic plant known for its striking appearance and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by planting small offshoots, making it relatively easy to cultivate. The growth cycle of Acuan bicornutum is continuous, with new shoots emerging throughout the growing season in warm climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-rich, well-draining soil and requires regular watering to maintain moist conditions. Fertilization with a balanced aquatic fertilizer and occasional pruning of old or damaged leaves help promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by algae overgrowth if water conditions are not properly maintained.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other aquatic plants can enhance its growth and create a balanced ecosystem in ponds or water gardens.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acuan bicornutum is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the pollination of other plants in the ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through mutualistic relationships. It also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acuan bicornutum plays a role in improving soil fertility by fixing nitrogen, benefiting the surrounding environment.</p>
