                <h1>Acuan bicornutum</h1>
<p>Acuan bicornutum, commonly known as the two-horned water lily, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that provide shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant produces distinctive white flowers with two prominent, horn-like projections on the petals. Its roots anchor in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, while its stems support the foliage.</p>
<p>Acuan bicornutum plays a vital role in maintaining water quality and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acuan bicornutum has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are medium in size, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a climbing growth pattern, often twining around supports. The flowers are small, white or pale pink, clustered in loose inflorescences, and bloom in late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan bicornutum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in wetlands and marshy areas. This plant thrives in humid environments with abundant water and organic soil. It is often associated with riverbanks, swamps, and coastal areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of aquatic habitats in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan bicornutum was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in various regions, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant is often spread by water currents or through the movement of soil. Its rapid growth and adaptability have allowed it to establish itself in many locations.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
