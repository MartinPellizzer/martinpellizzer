<p>Acridocarpus graniticus, commonly known as the granite acacia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stem and bipinnate leaves that are densely covered with small, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>
