                <h1>Acridocarpus graniticus</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus graniticus, commonly known as the granite acacia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stem and bipinnate leaves that are densely covered with small, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus graniticus has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are typically green and slightly serrated, measuring about 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, and have a yellowish-green color, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus graniticus is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry and arid regions of the island, particularly in the southern and southwestern parts. This plant thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often growing on exposed rock faces or in dry forests. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that provide the necessary conditions for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus graniticus was mainly introduced to areas with rocky, well-drained soils, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where it can receive ample sunlight and has good air circulation. This plant is commonly found in regions with a warm climate and low rainfall. It is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has sometimes led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
