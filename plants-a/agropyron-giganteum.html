                    <h1>Agropyron giganteum</h1>
<p>Agropyron giganteum, commonly known as the giant wheatgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, erect stems and wide, bluish-green leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and arctic regions, due to its cold tolerance and deep root system.</p>
<p>Agropyron giganteum is often used in ecological restoration projects because of its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
