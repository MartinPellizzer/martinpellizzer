                    <h1>Ascogrammitis colombiensis</h1>
<p>Ascogrammitis colombiensis, commonly known as the Colombian chain fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes mountains of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, delicate fronds that form a dense, creeping mat. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests and rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
