                <h1>Acrocarpus densifolius</h1>
<p>Acrocarpus densifolius, commonly known as the dense-leaved acrocarpus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and can grow up to 30 meters in height. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with prominent veins. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its timber and ornamental qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus densifolius has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that has a slightly fibrous texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in clusters, which bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus densifolius is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of India, particularly in the eastern and southern regions. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in lowland and hill forests. It is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils and is an important component of the forest understory.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends to some parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus densifolius was mainly introduced to South East Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its rapid growth and potential for timber production. The plant has since spread beyond its original introduction sites, becoming naturalized in some regions. It is now considered an invasive species in certain areas due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution highlights the ecological impacts of introducing non-native plant species.</p>
