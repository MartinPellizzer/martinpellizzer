<p>Avena involuta, commonly known as the curled oat or curly oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, curling leaves that form dense, mat-like growths on the ground. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are often hidden beneath the foliage. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and establish dense stands in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Avena involuta is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions.</p>
