                    <h1>Alnus yasha var. macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Alnus yasha var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to certain regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, simple leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant produces large, woody seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its reproductive strategy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones.</p>
<p>The tree has a shallow root system, making it susceptible to flooding but adaptable to wet environments.</p>
