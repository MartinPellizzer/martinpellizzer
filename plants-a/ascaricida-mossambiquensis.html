<p>Ascaricida mossambiquensis, commonly known as the African mossy fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, moss-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in compact, spore-producing clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
