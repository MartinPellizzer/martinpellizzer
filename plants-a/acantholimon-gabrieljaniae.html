                        <h1>Acantholimon gabrieljaniae</h1>
<p>Acantholimon gabrieljaniae, commonly known as Gabrieljaniae's thorned bladderwort, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, delicate flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it retain moisture. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
