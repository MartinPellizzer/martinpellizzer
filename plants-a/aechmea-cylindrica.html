                <h1>Aechmea cylindrica</h1>
<p>Aechmea cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture and can grow up to 1 meter in length. It produces striking pink or red flower spikes that emerge from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil and moderate humidity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea cylindrica has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, fleshy, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, but it has a short, sturdy base with a thick, smooth bark-like covering. Its flowers are clustered in a spike, with violet petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cylindrical capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for water storage, typical of bromeliads.</p>
