                    <h1>Asplenium × morganii</h1>
<p>Asplenium × morganii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species, with a distinctive dark green color and a slightly curled appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate regions where both parent species are native. Asplenium × morganii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor or outdoor plant.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and is propagated through vegetative means.</p>
