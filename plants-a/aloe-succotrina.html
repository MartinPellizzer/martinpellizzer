<p>Aloe succotrina, commonly known as the red aloe, is a perennial succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a reddish tinge, which store water for survival in arid conditions. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers on tall, branching stems during the warmer months. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that has been used for its soothing properties.</p>
<p>Aloe succotrina thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping.</p>
