                <h1>Acilepis belcheri</h1>
<p>Acilepis belcheri, commonly known as the Belcher's acacia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas and dry habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are characteristic of the Acacieae tribe. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, feather-like leaflets.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting local insect and bird populations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis belcheri has leaves that are simple, ovate in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule containing several small seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis belcheri is primarily native to Myanmar.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. It thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly associated with secondary forests and is often seen growing along riverbanks and in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Myanmar.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis belcheri was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa and Namibia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the shores, where it thrives in the saline and windy conditions. This plant has been reported in several conservation areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native vegetation. Its introduction is likely due to natural dispersal via wind or human activities such as coastal development.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it remains a characteristic species of the coastal biome in these regions.</p>
