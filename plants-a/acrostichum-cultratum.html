                <h1>Acrostichum cultratum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum cultratum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across the forest floor. Its leaves are compound, with a distinctive bifurcated shape at the tip.</p>
<p>Acrostichum cultratum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cultratum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, often silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that has a fibrous texture and exhibits a monopodial growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in panicles during the summer months, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-lobed, spiny capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after drying and splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense underground network that helps stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cultratum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, riverbanks, and moist lowland habitats. This fern thrives in humid environments with rich, organic soil. It is often associated with mangrove forests and saltwater marshes.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends to parts of the Caribbean as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cultratum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and wetlands where it forms dense, spreading colonies. The plant is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive fronds. However, it has also become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now widespread in regions with warm, humid climates.</p>
