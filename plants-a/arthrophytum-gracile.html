                    <h1>Arthrophytum gracile</h1>
<p>Arthrophytum gracile, commonly known as the slender jointed saxifrage, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with fleshy, jointed stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Arthrophytum gracile is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
