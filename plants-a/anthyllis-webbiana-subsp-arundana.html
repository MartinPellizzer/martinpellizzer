<p>Anthyllis webbiana subsp.</p>
<p>arundana, commonly known as the woolly broom, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
