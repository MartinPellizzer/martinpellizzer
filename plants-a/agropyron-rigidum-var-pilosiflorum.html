<p>Agropyron rigidum var. pilosiflorum, commonly known as the hairy floret wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear hairy florets, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant.</p>
