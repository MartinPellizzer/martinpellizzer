                        <h1>Acacia spadicigera</h1>
<p>Acacia spadicigera, commonly known as the broad-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often bipinnate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>The wood of Acacia spadicigera is hard and durable, historically used by Indigenous Australians for tool-making and construction.</p>
