                <h1>Aconitum stapfianum</h1>
<p>Aconitum stapfianum, commonly known as Stapf's aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of showy blue to violet flowers. The plant has palmately divided, deeply lobed leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Aconitum stapfianum is known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it a dangerous plant to handle, and it thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens, though care must be taken due to its poisonous nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum stapfianum has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 10 to 20 cm in diameter, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hollow, and covered with a rough, bark-like texture, growing to a height of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spires, consisting of 5 petal-like sepals and 5 stamens, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, tuberous, and serve as storage organs for nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum stapfianum is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Hubei provinces. This plant typically grows in mountainous areas with moist, well-drained soils. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific regions within southern and central China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum stapfianum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking blue-violet flowers and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in gardens and public landscapes for its aesthetic value. However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it can outcompete native plant species. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it adaptable to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
