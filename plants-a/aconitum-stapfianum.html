<p>Aconitum stapfianum, commonly known as Stapf's aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of showy blue to violet flowers. The plant has palmately divided, deeply lobed leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Aconitum stapfianum is known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it a dangerous plant to handle, and it thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens, though care must be taken due to its poisonous nature.</p>
