                    <h1>Aspidium schkuhrii</h1>
<p>Aspidium schkuhrii, commonly known as the Schkuhri's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>
