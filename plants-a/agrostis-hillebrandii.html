                    <h1>Agrostis hillebrandii</h1>
<p>Agrostis hillebrandii, commonly known as the Hillebrand's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in riparian zones.</p>
