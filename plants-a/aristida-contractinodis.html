<p>Aristida contractinodis, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny, three-awned bracts. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
