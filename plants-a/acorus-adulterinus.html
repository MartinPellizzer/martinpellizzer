                <h1>Acorus adulterinus</h1>
<p>Acorus adulterinus, commonly known as the slender sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped leaves and a distinctive, aromatic underground rhizome. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. Acorus adulterinus is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and rivers.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in botany and ecology.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus adulterinus has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bright green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows monostichously. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, with a structure consisting of three sepals and three petals, typically greenish-white in color, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-angled, three-valved capsule that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense underground network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus adulterinus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with rich, moist soil. It is often associated with riparian zones and can be found in both natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the region due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus adulterinus was mainly introduced to freshwater habitats in the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant is often mistaken for Acorus calamus due to its similar appearance. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions where it has established itself.</p>
