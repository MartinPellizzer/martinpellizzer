                    <h1>Arachis × batizogaea</h1>
<p>Arachis × batizogaea, commonly known as the peanut hybrid, is a botanical species resulting from the cross between two peanut species, Arachis hypogaea and Arachis stenosperma.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets. It produces flowers that develop into underground pods containing edible seeds, a trait shared with its parent species. The plant thrives in warm climates and well-drained soils, making it suitable for cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its genetic diversity contributes to the development of improved peanut varieties with enhanced yield and disease resistance.</p>
