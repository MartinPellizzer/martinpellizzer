                    <h1>Aeluropus littoralis var. intermedius</h1>
<p>Aeluropus littoralis var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate salt marsh grass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas, particularly in estuaries and tidal flats, where it tolerates high levels of salt and fluctuating water levels. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting structures. It forms dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion in vulnerable coastal zones.</p>
<p>This variant is intermediate in its ecological preferences between the strictly marine and terrestrial forms of the species.</p>
