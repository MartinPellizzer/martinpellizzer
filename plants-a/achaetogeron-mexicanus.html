                        <h1>Achaetogeron mexicanus</h1>
<p>Achaetogeron mexicanus, commonly known as the Mexican liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, thalloid liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a flattened, ribbon-like body called a thallus. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Achaetogeron mexicanus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
