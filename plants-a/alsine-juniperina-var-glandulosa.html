<p>Alsine juniperina var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular junipergrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wiry, often branched stems covered with small, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slightly waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
