<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like foliage that turns vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant has a compact growth habit with multiple trunks and a broad, rounded crown. Its leaves are trifoliate or palmately compound, with a distinctive network of veins that give it its name.</p>
<p>It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum var. reticulatum has leaves that are broadly ovate to triangular in shape, with a finely serrated margin and a delicate, lace-like pattern of veins, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–10 cm in length, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside, turning red or bronze in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a rounded crown. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a paired samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum var. reticulatum is a variant of the Japanese maple known for its distinctive lace-like foliage.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Japan, it thrives in cool, temperate climates. While it was historically found in specific forested areas, it is now cultivated in gardens and parks worldwide. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, typically growing at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Despite its popularity as an ornamental plant, it is considered endangered in the wild due to habitat loss and limited natural range.</p>
