<p>Ancistrodesmus, commonly known as the floating fern, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. They typically grow in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Ancistrodesmus species are known for their ability to form dense mats on the water surface, which can affect water quality and aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Their simple, lance-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers are typical of the genus.</p>
