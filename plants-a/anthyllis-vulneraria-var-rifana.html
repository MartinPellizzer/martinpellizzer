                    <h1>Anthyllis vulneraria var. rifana</h1>
<p>Anthyllis vulneraria var. rifana, commonly known as the Rif viper's bugloss, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers arranged in dense spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and specific habitat preferences compared to other forms of Anthyllis vulneraria.</p>
