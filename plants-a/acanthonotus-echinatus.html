                        <h1>Acanthonotus echinatus</h1>
<p>Acanthonotus echinatus, commonly known as the spiny sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in tropical and subtropical marine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aeplysiidae and is characterized by its distinctive spiny skin covering. The plant, more accurately a marine gastropod mollusk, has a soft body with a shell that is typically absent or reduced. Its body is often adorned with spines, which provide protection against predators.</p>
<p>The coloration of Acanthonotus echinatus can vary, but it is usually a combination of brown, yellow, and white hues.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthonotus echinatus is primarily native to the eastern Pacific Ocean, specifically along the coasts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Mexico, Costa Rica, and Ecuador. This species thrives in warm, tropical marine environments. It is often associated with rocky substrates and shallow coastal waters.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to these specific geographic areas within the eastern Pacific.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthonotus echinatus was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has established itself in regions with similar ecological conditions to its native habitat. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor its spread and assess its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
