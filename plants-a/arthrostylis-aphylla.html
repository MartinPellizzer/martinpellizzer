                    <h1>Arthrostylis aphylla</h1>
<p>Arthrostylis aphylla, commonly known as the leafless spider orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with the plant relying solely on its flowering stems for photosynthesis. The plant produces intricate, spider-like flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a unique structure that aids in pollination. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
