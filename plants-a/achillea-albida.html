                <h1>Achillea albida</h1>
<p>Achillea albida, commonly known as white yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves and produces flat, whitish to pale yellow composite flower heads. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in dry grasslands and rocky habitats. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea albida has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged in a basal rosette, and measure approximately 5-10 cm in length, with a grayish-green color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color, growing from the base of the plant in a compact, herbaceous form. Its flowers are composite, consisting of white ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a achene, dispersed by wind due to its light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea albida is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in the Mediterranean, it is now also distributed in some temperate regions of the world, including parts of the United States and Australia. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and open woodlands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea albida is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though it faces threats from habitat loss and invasive species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea albida is a flowering plant known for its delicate white blooms and hardy nature, commonly cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. The growth cycle of Achillea albida typically spans from spring to early fall, with active growth and flowering occurring during the warmer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too damp.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea albida is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, due to its bright white flowers and abundant nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other wildflowers to enhance biodiversity in meadows and gardens. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting pollinator populations and improving habitat quality in natural ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea albida is a flowering plant known for its medicinal properties, often used in traditional medicine to treat ailments such as respiratory issues and skin conditions.</p>
<p>It has also been explored for its potential in the pharmaceutical industry due to its bioactive compounds. While not widely used in culinary applications, some cultures may incorporate it into local recipes for its mild flavor. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in certain regions, representing resilience and healing.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems also contributes to its importance in environmental conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea albida has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Snow Drift' and 'Albiflora', which are known for their fluffy white flowers and compact growth habit. Hybrids of Achillea albida often combine traits from different species within the genus, resulting in plants with enhanced disease resistance and extended blooming periods. These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in gardens and landscapes due to their low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>Their horticultural importance lies in their ability to add visual interest and texture to flower beds and borders.</p>
