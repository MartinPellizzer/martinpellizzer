                <h1>Achillea albida</h1>
<p>Achillea albida, commonly known as white yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, arranged in flat-topped clusters. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, with a slightly bitter scent.</p>
<p>Achillea albida is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea albida has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and vary in size from 2 to 6 centimeters in length, with a silver-gray or whitish color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, somewhat hairy, and has a light green color, growing upright with a branching pattern that becomes more diffuse as the plant matures. The flowers are composite, consisting of both ray florets and disk florets, with a pale yellow to white coloration, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) enclosed in a pappus of bristles, which facilitates wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea albida is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of North Africa and the Canary Islands. This species thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and wastelands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea albida is considered endangered in some regions and is protected in several countries.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea albida is a flowering plant known for its white blooms and hardy nature, commonly grown in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in the spring. The growth cycle of Achillea albida begins with germination in early spring, followed by rapid growth, flowering in summer, and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea albida is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, due to its bright white flowers and abundant nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by attracting beneficial insects. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Achillea albida also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health through its role in nutrient cycling.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea albida is a flowering plant known for its diverse uses and applications across various fields.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, it is occasionally used as a spice or flavoring agent due to its aromatic properties.
