<p>Aspidium quadrangulare, commonly known as the four-cornered water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, quadrilateral-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>Aspidium quadrangulare is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate a range of soil types.</p>
