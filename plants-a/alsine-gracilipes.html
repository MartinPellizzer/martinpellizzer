<p>Alsine gracilipes, commonly known as slender alsike, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, often greenish or reddish in color, which are followed by small, bead-like seeds. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Alsine gracilipes thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields.</p>
