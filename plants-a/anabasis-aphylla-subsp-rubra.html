<p>Anabasis aphylla subsp.</p>
<p>rubra, commonly known as red sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems that often turn reddish in color, especially under stress.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
