<p>Agropyron sclerophyllum, commonly known as the hard-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agropyron sclerophyllum is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil, making it a hardy and resilient species.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native habitats.</p>
