                    <h1>Allochrusa lutea</h1>
<p>Allochrusa lutea, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, succulent structure that helps it survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Allochrusa lutea is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices.</p>
