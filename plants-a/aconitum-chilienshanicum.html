                <h1>Aconitum chilienshanicum</h1>
<p>Aconitum chilienshanicum, commonly known as the Yunnan aconite, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, spire-like inflorescences. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments, and the roots are tuberous and contain toxic alkaloids.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum chilienshanicum has leaves that are deeply lobed, typically ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and can reach up to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and covered with a rough, bark-like texture, ranging from green to brown in color, and exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurred shape, blooming from July to September, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are small, black, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
