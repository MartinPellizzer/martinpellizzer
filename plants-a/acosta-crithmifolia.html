                <h1>Acosta crithmifolia</h1>
<p>Acosta crithmifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and fragrant foliage, it is cultivated in gardens for both its aesthetic and aromatic qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta crithmifolia has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a growth pattern that is branching towards the top. The flowers are small, yellowish-white, and clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky, arid environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta crithmifolia is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and coastal areas, often found on cliffs and along the shores. This plant is well adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a hardy species in such habitats. It is commonly found in countries like Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and parts of Italy.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, its distribution is limited to these particular regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta crithmifolia was mainly introduced to coastal areas of California and Oregon in the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its aromatic foliage and small white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. It has become naturalized in some regions, posing a potential threat to native plant communities.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is now monitored in conservation efforts along the Pacific coast.</p>
