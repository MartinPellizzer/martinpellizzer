<p>Alhagi pseudalhagi subsp.</p>
<p>pseudalhagi, commonly known as the desert shrub or sand verbena, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink or purple.</p>
<p>The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
