<p>Acacia calligera, commonly known as the slender acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and small, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. Acacia calligera is adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife.</p>
