                    <h1>Axonopus compressus var. affinis</h1>
<p>Axonopus compressus var. affinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf carpetgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has slender, spreading stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are arranged in clusters along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lawns, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and dense foliage make it both a desirable ground cover and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
