                <h1>Acilepis kingii</h1>
<p>Acilepis kingii, commonly known as the King's acilepis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Acilepis kingii thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis kingii has leaves that are simple, alternate, and ovate in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The leaves vary in size, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and are arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern. The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with yellow petals and a distinct central stamen, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis kingii is primarily native to Thailand.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in forested areas. This plant thrives in humid and warm climates, often growing in the understorey of secondary forests. It is not commonly found outside of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Thailand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis kingii was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It has since become established in several regions, particularly in the North Island, where it thrives in a variety of soil types. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means have led to its classification as an invasive species in some areas. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to outcompete native flora.</p>
<p>Efforts are currently underway to monitor and manage its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
