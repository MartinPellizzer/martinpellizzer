                <h1>Achyrophorus bipontinae</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus bipontinae, commonly known as the Mediterranean rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or limestone soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring. It is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in alpine or coastal regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus bipontinae has leaves that are simple, alternate, and ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and being pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus bipontinae is primarily native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Himalayas, specifically in India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the alpine and subalpine zones at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters. This plant thrives in rocky soils and open slopes, often growing in association with other high-altitude flora. Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas, making it a rare and localized species.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus bipontinae was mainly introduced to areas with moist, calcareous soils and shaded environments, typically found in forested regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate zones across Europe, particularly in regions with a Mediterranean climate. The plant thrives in habitats such as woodland edges, stream banks, and rocky slopes. Its introduction has been largely due to natural dispersal through wind and water, as well as human activity.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
