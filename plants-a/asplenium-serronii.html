<p>Asplenium serronii, commonly known as the serrated maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a serrated or toothed margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, while the fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture.</p>
