                    <h1>Asplenium polyodon var. squamulosum</h1>
<p>Asplenium polyodon var. squamulosum, commonly known as the scalloped maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern genus Asplenium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green, and often scalloped fronds that give it a delicate appearance. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
