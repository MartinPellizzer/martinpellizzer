                <h1>Actinophloeus montanus</h1>
<p>Actinophloeus montanus, commonly known as the mountain actinophloeus, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus montanus has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus montanus is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of northern Vietnam and northern Laos. This plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. It is often associated with limestone substrates and is commonly found in secondary forests.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus montanus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of an ornamental plant collection. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand.</p>
