                <h1>Achillea setacea</h1>
<p>Achillea setacea, commonly known as the silky yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely hairy, gray-green leaves and flat, composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Achillea setacea is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea setacea has narrow, linear leaves that are gray-green in color, arranged in a basal rosette, and measure up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and form dense flat-topped clusters called compound umbels, blooming from late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea setacea is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, France, and Italy.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of North Africa, including Morocco and Algeria. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is commonly found in Mediterranean regions. It is often associated with open landscapes such as slopes, cliffs, and wastelands.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptability to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea setacea was mainly introduced to specific regions in the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was originally brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, feathery foliage and yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly along roadsides and in open habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on biodiversity.</p>
