                <h1>Actinodaphne lancifolia</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved camphor tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, aromatic bark, which contains essential oils. It typically grows as a small to medium-sized evergreen tree, often found in moist, shaded habitats.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dark purple drupe that develops from the flower, contributing to its ecological and botanical significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne lancifolia has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through bird ingestion and excretion.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and spread widely underground, helping to stabilize the soil and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne lancifolia is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Indo-Malayan region, where it thrives in tropical rainforests. This plant prefers humid, shaded environments and is typically found in lowland to mid-altitude areas, ranging from 200 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is listed as least concern, though local populations may face threats.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne lancifolia is a tropical evergreen shrub known for its ornamental value and aromatic leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid climates with indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it requires well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between sessions. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and occasional pruning to shape the plant are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or mealybugs, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other aromatic herbs like lemongrass or citronella can enhance its growth and natural pest repellent properties.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne lancifolia is a tropical evergreen tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its fragrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and birds, which are essential for its reproduction and the health of the surrounding flora. The tree also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native species in the understory. Its dense foliage helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the soil in forest environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>
