                    <h1>Asplenium × angodongodonaense</h1>
<p>Asplenium × angodongodonaense, commonly known as the hybrid holly fern, is a rare and intriguing fern species resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium bulbiferum*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring a combination of the frond structures from both parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, a common trait among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and hybrid nature, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of interest to taxonomists and conservationists.</p>
