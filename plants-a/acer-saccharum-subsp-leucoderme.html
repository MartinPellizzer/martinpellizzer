<p>Acer saccharum subsp.</p>
<p>leucoderme, commonly known as the white-veined sugar maple, is a variant of the sugar maple native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive white veins on the leaves, which set it apart from the typical green-veined sugar maple.</p>
<p>The plant is a deciduous tree that typically grows to heights of 20â€“30 meters, with a broad, rounded crown. Its leaves are palmately lobed and turn vibrant shades of yellow and orange in the fall.</p>
<p>The tree produces samaras as its fruit, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
