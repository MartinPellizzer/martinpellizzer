                <h1>Achras brasiliensis</h1>
<p>Achras brasiliensis, commonly known as the "Brazil nut tree," is a tall, evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, palm-like leaves that are often deeply lobed. The tree produces large, woody fruits that contain up to 20 seeds, which are the edible Brazil nuts. Its root system is extensive and plays a crucial role in stabilizing the soil in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates with high rainfall.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras brasiliensis has large, palmate leaves that are broad, lobed, and dark green, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and is often branched. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spiny, spherical berry that contains numerous seeds, dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are extensive and fibrous, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras brasiliensis is a species native to Brazil, specifically found in the Atlantic Forest region.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to fragmented areas within its original range. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is currently listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras brasiliensis is a tropical plant known for its ornamental value and unique appearance, often cultivated as a decorative tree or shrub.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. The growth cycle of Achras brasiliensis is relatively slow, with a long period of vegetative growth followed by flowering and fruiting in mature plants.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by fungal issues if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant plants can enhance its growth in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras brasiliensis is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds due to its showy flowers and abundant nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing soil fertility and promoting biodiversity. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting a diverse range of fauna and maintaining the balance of its ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achras brasiliensis is a plant native to South America, known for its large, edible fruits that are used in culinary applications, particularly in Brazil, where they are often consumed fresh or processed into juices and jams.</p>
<p>It also has medicinal uses, with traditional practices employing its parts to treat ailments such as inflammation and digestive issues. Industrially, the plant contributes to the economy through its fruit production, supporting local agriculture and trade. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some communities, representing abundance and resilience.</p>
<p>Its versatility makes it an important resource in both ecological and human contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achras brasiliensis has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Cocodrie' and 'Cocodrie Giant,' known for their large, spiny fruits and attractive foliage. While natural hybrids are rare, horticulturalists have developed selections that enhance fruit size and ornamental appeal. These plants are important in horticulture for their unique appearance and potential use in ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Their cultivation contributes to biodiversity and provides a striking visual element in gardens and public spaces.</p>
