                <h1>Achras brasiliensis</h1>
<p>Achras brasiliensis, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, featuring a thick, buttressed trunk and broad, palm-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into large, yellowish fruits resembling bread. The fruit is edible when ripe and has a starchy, bread-like texture, making it an important food source in some regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras brasiliensis has large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 1 to 3 meters in diameter, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is a thick, woody trunk that grows straight upward, often reaching several meters in height, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. The plant produces large, yellowish-white flowers arranged in a panicle inflorescence, blooming during the dry season, and is primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a large, fibrous capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are extensive and deep, anchoring the plant and helping it survive in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras brasiliensis is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, where it thrives in humid and warm climates. This plant is often associated with coastal areas and can be seen growing in sandy soils near the shoreline. It is also present in parts of Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in the biodiversity of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras brasiliensis was mainly introduced to the Caribbean, Central America, and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites due to its ability to thrive in sandy or poorly drained soils. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly for its large, palm-like leaves and striking yellow flowers. It has also been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
