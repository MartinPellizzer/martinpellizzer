                    <h1>Avena alpina</h1>
<p>Avena alpina, commonly known as alpine oat, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the seeds are enclosed in a protective husk.</p>
<p>Avena alpina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
