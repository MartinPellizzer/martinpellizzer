                <h1>Acidosasa carinata</h1>
<p>Acidosasa carinata, commonly known as the hairy poinsettia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in warm, humid climates. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Acidosasa carinata is often cultivated for its ornamental value during the holiday season.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidosasa carinata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a rapid growth pattern in its early stages. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<p>It is found in the southern regions of China, including provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly associated with forest understories and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely linked to the biodiversity-rich ecosystems of Southeast China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidosasa carinata was mainly introduced to control weed competition in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It is commonly used as a cover crop to prevent soil erosion and improve soil fertility. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is particularly effective in nitrogen fixation. Its introduction has helped reduce the need for chemical fertilizers in many farming systems.</p>
