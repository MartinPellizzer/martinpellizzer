                <h1>Acer lanpingense</h1>
<p>Acer lanpingense, commonly known as the Lanting maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10-20 meters and has a broad, rounded crown. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lanpingense has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, turning yellow in autumn. The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lanpingense is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in southwestern China.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Hengduan Mountains, where it thrives in humid, subtropical environments. It typically grows at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,500 meters, often in shaded, moist forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer lanpingense is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lanpingense is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves active growth in spring and summer, with a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or groundcovers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lanpingense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing soil health and supporting a diverse range of flora. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer lanpingense contributes to carbon sequestration, helping to mitigate climate change impacts in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer lanpingense is a species of maple tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
