                    <h1>Arctium minus f. laciniatum</h1>
<p>Arctium minus f. laciniatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burdock, is a variant of the common burdock characterized by its finely lobed leaves.</p>
<p>It is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces spiky, bract-covered flower heads that mature into woody, seed-containing burrs. Its leaves are usually narrower and more dissected compared to the typical form of Arctium minus.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in traditional medicine and has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
