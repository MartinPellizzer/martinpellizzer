                    <h1>Anisoptera polyandra</h1>
<p>Anisoptera polyandra, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in many regions.</p>
