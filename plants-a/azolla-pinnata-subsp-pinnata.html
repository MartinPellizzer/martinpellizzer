<p>Azolla pinnata subsp.</p>
<p>pinnata, commonly known as floating fern or water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its floating, free-floating leaves that form dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>The plant has a unique ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with cyanobacteria. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is also used in phytoremediation due to its capacity to absorb heavy metals from water.</p>
