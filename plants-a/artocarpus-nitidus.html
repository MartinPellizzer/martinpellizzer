                    <h1>Artocarpus nitidus</h1>
<p>Artocarpus nitidus, commonly known as the glossy soursop or white soursop, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale green to white bark and large, heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The tree produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that eventually develop into spherical, spiky fruits. The fruit has a thick, leathery rind and a soft, segmented pulp that contains a single large, inedible seed.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit, though it is less commonly consumed than other artocarpus species.</p>
