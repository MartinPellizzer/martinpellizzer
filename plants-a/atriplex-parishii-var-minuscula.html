                    <h1>Atriplex parishii var. minuscula</h1>
<p>Atriplex parishii var. minuscula, commonly known as the smallleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, a feature typical of many members of the Chenopodiaceae family. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
