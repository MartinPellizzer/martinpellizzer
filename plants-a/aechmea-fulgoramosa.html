                <h1>Aechmea fulgoramosa</h1>
<p>Aechmea fulgoramosa, commonly known as the fiery torch bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in a tall inflorescence, adding dramatic visual contrast. Its foliage is often adorned with striking red and purple markings, enhancing its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Aechmea fulgoramosa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea fulgoramosa has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, fleshy, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a waxy, bluish-green color and a dark green underside.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, thickened base covered in a fibrous, light brown bark. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, with small, white to yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and the plant has a fibrous root system adapted for absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
