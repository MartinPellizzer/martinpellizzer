<p>Atriplex farinosa subsp.</p>
<p>farinosa, commonly known as prickly cholla, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its branching stems covered in small, spiny tubercles that provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by spherical, dry fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
