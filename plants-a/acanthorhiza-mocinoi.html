                        <h1>Acanthorhiza mocinoi</h1>
<p>Acanthorhiza mocinoi, commonly known as the Mocino's thornroot, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems. The plant has distinctive thorn-like structures on its stems, which are thought to be a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthorhiza mocinoi is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. It is often associated with rocky or limestone substrates.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthorhiza mocinoi was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia. It has been reported in several states as an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>Its introduction is often associated with human activity, including landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
