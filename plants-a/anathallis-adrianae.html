                    <h1>Anathallis adrianae</h1>
<p>Anathallis adrianae, commonly known as the Adriana's spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spider-like inflorescence, which consists of several slender, curved floral stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct, intricate structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anathallis adrianae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
