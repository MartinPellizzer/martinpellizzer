<p>Amsinckia hispida, commonly known as the sticky evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a rough, textured appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its seeds are encased in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Amsinckia hispida is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
