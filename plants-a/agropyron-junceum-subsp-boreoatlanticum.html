<p>Agropyron junceum subsp.</p>
<p>boreoatlanticum, commonly known as the boreoatlantic meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern parts of North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological stability of these environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in saturated soils makes it an important component of riparian and wetland ecosystems.</p>
