                <h1>Aconitum boreale</h1>
<p>Aconitum boreale, commonly known as the northern monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It features striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a deep taproot and grows in moist, rocky soils, often in alpine or tundra environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive, somewhat poisonous appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum boreale is part of the Ranunculaceae family and contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant to be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum boreale has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, arranged alternately along the stem, with each leaflet being narrow and lance-shaped, typically measuring up to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hollow, and covered with a smooth, bluish-green bark that has a fibrous texture, growing upright with a single main stem. The flowers are blue to purple in color, arranged in dense spikes at the top of the plant, with each flower having five sepals and two petals, and they bloom from July to August, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed follicle that releases small, flat, winged seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum boreale is primarily native to the northern regions of Europe, including Scandinavia, the British Isles, and parts of Russia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine areas, growing in rocky soils and mountainous terrain. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often associated with high-altitude habitats. Its distribution extends into northern Asia, particularly in regions with similar climatic conditions.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and forested areas at elevations above 1,000 meters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum boreale was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the late 19th century by European settlers who admired its aesthetic value. Despite its beauty, the plant has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species for resources. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
