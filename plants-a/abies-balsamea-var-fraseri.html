                    <h1>Abies balsamea var. fraseri</h1>
<p>Abies balsamea var. fraseri, commonly known as Fraser fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more pointed than those of the typical balsam fir. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Fraser fir thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found at high elevations.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in the production of Christmas trees.</p>
