<p>Angraecum hologlottis, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude forests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant has adapted to its environment with specialized structures that aid in water retention and nutrient absorption. Its flowers are pollinated by the hawkmoth, which has a long proboscis suited for reaching the nectar deep within the floral tubes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts.</p>
