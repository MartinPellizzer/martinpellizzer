                    <h1>Aspilia huillensis</h1>
<p>Aspilia huillensis, commonly known as the Huill√©n's torch flower, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and dense clusters of bright orange to red cylindrical flower heads, which resemble torches. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, adapting to the harsh conditions of its environment. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds via wind.</p>
<p>Aspilia huillensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
