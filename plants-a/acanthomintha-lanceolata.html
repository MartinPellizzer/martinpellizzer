                        <h1>Acanthomintha lanceolata</h1>
<p>Acanthomintha lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acanthomintha, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Acanthomintha lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acanthomintha lanceolata belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their primitive vascular structures and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is characterized by diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Lamiales, a group of flowering plants that includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs, often with showy flowers. Its family is Lamiaceae, commonly known as the mint family, characterized by square stems, opposite leaves, and aromatic oils. Its genus is Acanthomintha, a small group of flowering plants native to South America, known for their distinctive appearance and ecological significance.</p>
<p>Its species is Acanthomintha lanceolata, a specific plant within the genus Acanthomintha, distinguished by its lance-shaped leaves and unique floral characteristics.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthomintha lanceolata is primarily native to California.</p>
<p>It is found in specific regions within the state, particularly in the coastal and inland areas. This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. It is commonly associated with the southern and central parts of California.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthomintha lanceolata was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often in disturbed or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant has been reported in several states across the western United States, including California, Oregon, and Nevada. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human-mediated spread through horticultural activities.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become established in native plant communities, sometimes outcompeting local flora.</p>
