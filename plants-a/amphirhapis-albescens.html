                    <h1>Amphirhapis albescens</h1>
<p>Amphirhapis albescens, commonly known as the white sand cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, adapted to survive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Amphirhapis albescens is often found in rocky soils and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for nocturnal pollinators.</p>
