                <h1>Acinos thymoides var. perennans</h1>
<p>Acinos thymoides var. perennans, commonly known as the perennial mountain thyme, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its aromatic foliage and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with rocky or dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos thymoides var. perennans has small, narrow, linear leaves that are often gray-green in color, arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are usually prostrate or ascending, with a rough, hairy texture and a reddish-brown bark. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny seeds through dryness, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and dry environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos thymoides var. perennans is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Spain, France, Italy, and the Balkans, where it thrives in rocky and limestone soils. This plant prefers dry, sunny environments such as steppes, slopes, and open woodlands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acinos thymoides var. perennans is a low-growing, aromatic perennial that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing in early spring or by dividing established clumps in the fall. This plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity within two to three years, and is hardy in USDA zones 5-8.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it requires minimal watering and benefits from a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring, along with light pruning after flowering to maintain its compact form. It is generally pest and disease resistant, though it may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, rosemary, or thyme enhances its aromatic qualities and supports beneficial insect activity.</p>
