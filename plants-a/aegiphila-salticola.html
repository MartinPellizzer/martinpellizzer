                <h1>Aegiphila salticola</h1>
<p>Aegiphila salticola, commonly known as the jumping bean plant, is a shrub native to the dry regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila salticola has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright and branching sparsely. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with tubular petals and a yellowish-orange color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils where the plant thrives.</p>
