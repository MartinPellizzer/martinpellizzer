                <h1>Achillea maura</h1>
<p>Achillea maura, commonly known as yellow archangel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Achillea maura is typically found in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea maura has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and covered in fine hairs, arranged in a rosette formation and reaching up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing from the base and branching towards the top. The flowers are small, yellowish-white, and arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea maura is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, including regions of the Iberian Peninsula, Italy, and the Balkans.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to parts of North Africa and the Middle East, where it has been introduced. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, or gravelly soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as slopes, meadows, and wastelands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not considered endangered, its populations are threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea maura is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and yellow flowers, commonly used in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of established clumps, with the best results achieved in early spring or fall. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, often dying back after two years, though it can sometimes persist longer under favorable conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in early spring, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or rust, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea maura is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering shelter and habitat within its dense foliage. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its ability to suppress weeds and improve soil conditions. Additionally, it plays a role in erosion control due to its deep root system that stabilizes soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea maura contributes to ecological balance by supporting biodiversity and maintaining healthy soil structure.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea maura is a flowering plant known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat wounds and inflammation due to its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory compounds.</p>
