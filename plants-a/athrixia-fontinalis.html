                    <h1>Athrixia fontinalis</h1>
<p>Athrixia fontinalis, commonly known as the mossy lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with a dark green to black upper surface and a lighter, often white or gray lower surface. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic partnership between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and substrate. It is often found on tree trunks, rocks, and soil in temperate forests.</p>
<p>This lichen is an indicator species for air quality and plays a role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
