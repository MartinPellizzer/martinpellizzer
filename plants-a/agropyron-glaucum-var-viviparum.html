                    <h1>Agropyron glaucum var. viviparum</h1>
<p>Agropyron glaucum var. viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and bluish-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, facilitating self-pollination. One of its notable botanical features is its ability to produce viviparous seeds, which germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows it to establish quickly in disturbed or nutrient-poor soils.</p>
