                <h1>Adenia lapiazicola</h1>
<p>Adenia lapiazicola, commonly known as the mountain adenia, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae, which includes passionflowers, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with five petals and a distinctive crown of stamens. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia lapiazicola has compound, pinnate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated edge and a moderate size, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is greyish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a shrub-like habit. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant anchor itself and store nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia lapiazicola is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern and southern regions of the country. This plant typically grows in humid, forested areas with well-drained soil. It is commonly found in the Antalaova and Manombo regions.</p>
<p>Adenia lapiazicola is an endemic species, meaning it is not found anywhere else in the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia lapiazicola was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the wild in the 1990s. The plant is believed to have been introduced through contaminated horticultural material. It has since spread to several regions, particularly in the North Island.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
