<p>Aira mollis, commonly known as rough air grass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it an important species in riparian ecosystems.</p>
