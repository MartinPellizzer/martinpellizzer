                    <h1>Alangium begoniifolium var. tomentosum</h1>
<p>Alangium begoniifolium var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly alangium, is a rare and ornamental plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, begoniifolium-like leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly pubescence, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and it produces dark blue or black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique foliage, it is highly valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ecological significance.</p>
