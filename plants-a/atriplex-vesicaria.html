                    <h1>Atriplex vesicaria</h1>
<p>Atriplex vesicaria, commonly known as the blister saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often glandular leaves that are coated with a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to saline soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy or coastal areas.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its use in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
