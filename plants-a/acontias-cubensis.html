                <h1>Acontias cubensis</h1>
<p>Acontias cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or white in color. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acontias cubensis is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acontias cubensis has leaves that are simple, ovate, and slightly serrated, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly woody with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-white flowers with four petals, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acontias cubensis is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba and the Isle of Youth.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and mangrove swamps where it thrives in moist, saline environments. This plant is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. It is also found in parts of the Bahamas and the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acontias cubensis was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of Florida and the Gulf Coast of the United States.</p>
<p>It has established itself in wetland and marsh habitats, often thriving in disturbed areas near water. The plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its spread has been facilitated by human activities such as construction and landscaping.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its population and prevent further spread.</p>
