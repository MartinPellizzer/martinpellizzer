                        <h1>Acacia maras</h1>
<p>Acacia maras, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green phyllodes that are often mistaken for leaves. The plant produces small, spherical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Acacia maras is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep root systems that help it access groundwater.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various desert animals.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia maras is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland ecosystems. This plant is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Acacia maras is also used by local communities for its timber and as a source of traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia maras was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This plant has been introduced for its potential in land rehabilitation and as a source of timber and fodder. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to regions where it can provide ecological and economic benefits without causing significant environmental harm.</p>
