                    <h1>Acacia maras</h1>
<p>Acacia maras, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green phyllodes that are often mistaken for leaves. The plant produces small, spherical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Acacia maras is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep root systems that help it access groundwater.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various desert animals.</p>
