                <h1>Aconitum achranthum</h1>
<p>Aconitum achranthum, commonly known as the European aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant produces toxic alkaloids, particularly aconitine, which makes it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Aconitum achranthum is often found in woodlands, meadows, and along streambanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum achranthum has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a greyish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spikes, and are pollinated by insects; they bloom in late summer. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a spiral mechanism, dispersing them by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storing nutrients and anchoring the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum achranthum is primarily native to Central Asia, specifically regions such as Kazakhstan, Russia, and parts of Mongolia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous areas and alpine meadows where the climate is cold and the soil is well-drained. This plant thrives in temperate to subarctic environments, often growing at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its native range includes the Altai Mountains and other highland regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its rugged habitat preferences, it is not commonly found in lowland areas or tropical climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum achranthum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the continent in the early 20th century by horticulturists who admired its aesthetic value. Despite its beauty, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation in moist, woodland habitats. The plant spreads rapidly through seed dispersal by wind and water, making it difficult to control.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
