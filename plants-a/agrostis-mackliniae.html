                    <h1>Agrostis mackliniae</h1>
<p>Agrostis mackliniae, commonly known as the Macklin's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal dunes or cliff faces. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains of pollen. It is adapted to salt-laden winds and can tolerate moderate drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
