                    <h1>Acrostichum wrightii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum wrightii, commonly known as Wright's fern, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family, characterized by its feathery fronds and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Its leaves, or fronds, are typically bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
