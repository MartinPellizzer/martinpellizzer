<p>Ampelocissus elephantina var. elephantina, commonly known as the elephant's foot plant, is a climbing vine native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that resemble elephant feet, which store water and help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale green leaves and yellowish-white flowers that appear in clusters. It is often grown as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive if not properly controlled.</p>
