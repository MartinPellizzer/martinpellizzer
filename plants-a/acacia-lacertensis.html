                    <h1>Acacia lacertensis</h1>
<p>Acacia lacertensis, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, bipinnate leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Acacia lacertensis is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access underground water.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
