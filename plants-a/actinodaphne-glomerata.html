                <h1>Actinodaphne glomerata</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne glomerata, commonly known as the clustered laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by dark, spherical berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne glomerata has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, dark green on top, and lighter green underneath, with a smooth surface and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant grows. Its small, clustered flowers are pale green to white in color, with a fragrant scent, and they bloom during the rainy season, likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne glomerata is primarily native to Borneo, Jawa, Lesser Sunda Is., Malaya, Sulawesi, Sumatera, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. This plant is commonly found in tropical rainforests and lowland areas within its native range. It thrives in humid and warm climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne glomerata plays an important ecological role in the regions where it is naturally found.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne glomerata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and warm climates, such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to various regions beyond its native range.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
