<p>Actinodaphne glomerata, commonly known as the clustered laurel, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered inflorescences that bear white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne glomerata is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne glomerata has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm long and arranged along the stems in a spiral pattern. The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exudes a fragrant resin when damaged. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers with a sweet fragrance, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a small, berry-like drupe that contains one seed, dispersed primarily by animals that eat the fruit.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne glomerata is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Indonesia and the Philippines, though it is now considered rare. It thrives in humid, lowland rainforests and prefers shaded, moist environments. This species typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Actinodaphne glomerata is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne glomerata is a tropical evergreen shrub known for its aromatic leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant and promote airflow are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like ginger or ornamental ferns can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne glomerata is a tropical evergreen tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Its fragrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and moths, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing biodiversity and soil health. It also contributes to erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes the soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence supports a wide range of ecological interactions, making it an important component of tropical ecosystems.</p>
