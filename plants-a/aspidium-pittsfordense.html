                    <h1>Aspidium pittsfordense</h1>
<p>Aspidium pittsfordense, commonly known as the Pittsford fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its fertile fronds. Aspidium pittsfordense thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
