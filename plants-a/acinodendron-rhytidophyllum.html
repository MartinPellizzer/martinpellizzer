                    <h1>Acinodendron rhytidophyllum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron rhytidophyllum, commonly known as the rough-leaved acinodendron, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
