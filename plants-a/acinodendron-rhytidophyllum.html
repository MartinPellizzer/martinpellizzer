                <h1>Acinodendron rhytidophyllum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron rhytidophyllum, commonly known as the rough-leaved acinodendron, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rhytidophyllum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is brown in color and exhibits a scrambling growth pattern. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rhytidophyllum is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these dense forest ecosystems. The plant is commonly found in the undergrowth of primary and secondary forests, where it relies on the canopy for protection from direct sunlight. It plays an important ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity and soil stability.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its native range has become increasingly fragmented.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rhytidophyllum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and degraded forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant is often found in regions with seasonal rainfall patterns. Its introduction has been associated with human activities like land clearing and gardening.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely understudied in many regions.</p>
