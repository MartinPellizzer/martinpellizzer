<p>Allophylus pervillei f. trifoliolatus, commonly known as the three-leaf alderleaf, is a variant of the Allophylus pervillei species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, fleshy berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils within forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>
