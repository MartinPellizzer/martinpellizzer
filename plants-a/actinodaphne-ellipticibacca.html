                <h1>Actinodaphne ellipticibacca</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne ellipticibacca, commonly known as the broad-leafed camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by dark, fleshy berries. Its bark and leaves contain essential oils, making it valuable in traditional medicine and perfumery.</p>
<p>The tree is also noted for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne ellipticibacca has elliptical, glossy dark green leaves that are alternate in arrangement, measuring approximately 10–15 cm in length and 4–6 cm in width.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slight longitudinal fissuring. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds through ingestion and excretion.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network underground, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne ellipticibacca is primarily native to Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This plant typically grows in lowland and hill forest areas. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Vietnam.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne ellipticibacca was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii, Tahiti, and parts of French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique fruiting structures. The plant has since become naturalized in these areas, often growing in coastal and lowland habitats. It is commonly found in disturbed sites and along roadsides, where it can thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
