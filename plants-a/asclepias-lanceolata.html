<p>Asclepias lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. It plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a common sight in woodland and meadow habitats.</p>
