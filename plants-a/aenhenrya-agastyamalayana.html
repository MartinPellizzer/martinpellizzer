                <h1>Aenhenrya agastyamalayana</h1>
<p>Aenhenrya agastyamalayana, commonly known as the Malabar orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming during the monsoon season. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and requires specific soil conditions for successful growth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aenhenrya agastyamalayana has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark with a slightly rough texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>
