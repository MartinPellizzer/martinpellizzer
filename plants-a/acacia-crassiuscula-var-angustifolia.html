                        <h1>Acacia crassiuscula var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia crassiuscula var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattles, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, feather-like phyllodes that are typically light green to grey-green in color. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense spherical heads. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system to access groundwater.</p>
<p>This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia crassiuscula var. angustifolia is primarily native to the eastern coast of Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the ACT.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal heathlands, sand dunes, and rocky outcrops. This variety is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in areas with a Mediterranean climate. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its distinctive narrow leaves and yellow flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia crassiuscula var. angustifolia was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and for its ornamental value in landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in regions with a Mediterranean climate. This plant has adapted well to various environmental conditions, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural areas. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils contribute to its spread.</p>
<p>However, it can outcompete native vegetation, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
