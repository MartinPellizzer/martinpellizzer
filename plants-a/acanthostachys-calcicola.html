                        <h1>Acanthostachys calcicola</h1>
<p>Acanthostachys calcicola, commonly known as the limestone chaffflower, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces small, spiky flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Acanthostachys calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying xerophytic plants.</p>
