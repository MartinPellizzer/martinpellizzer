                    <h1>Aristida palustris</h1>
<p>Aristida palustris, commonly known as marsh dropseed, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, swales, and other moist environments, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, fluffy seed heads that are characteristic of the grass family. Its ability to thrive in saturated soils makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Aristida palustris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
