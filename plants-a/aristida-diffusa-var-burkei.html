<p>Aristida diffusa var. burkei, commonly known as the burke's threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Aristida genus. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that aids in water conservation.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in arid conditions.</p>
