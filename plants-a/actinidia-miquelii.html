                <h1>Actinidia miquelii</h1>
<p>Actinidia miquelii, commonly known as the Miquel's actinidia, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in taste to kiwifruit but are less commonly consumed. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Actinidia miquelii is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential horticultural uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia miquelii has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern, often twining around supports. Its small, greenish-white flowers are actinomorphic, with five sepals and petals, and bloom in early summer, relying on insect pollination, primarily by bees. The fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that matures in late summer, dispersing via birds and other animals that consume the berries.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively along the forest floor.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia miquelii is primarily native to China, specifically in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Sichuan.</p>
<p>It grows in mountainous regions with a humid climate and is often found in temperate forests. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soil and partial shade. It is commonly associated with the understory of secondary forests and is sometimes found near streams or rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia miquelii was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for fruit production.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along streambanks in regions with moist, temperate climates. The plant has been reported in several states, including Pennsylvania, New York, and Ohio, where it has established itself in naturalized habitats. Despite its ornamental value, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly and outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists regarding its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
