<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in spines and have a ribbed structure. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its adaptations include a succulent structure for water storage and a nocturnal blooming cycle to conserve moisture.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in arid environments and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
