                <h1>Achimenes splendens</h1>
<p>Achimenes splendens, commonly known as the flame violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple, often with contrasting yellow markings. The plant has hairy, upright stems and heart-shaped, velvety leaves. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and is often grown as a tropical houseplant.</p>
<p>Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes splendens has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age, growing upright and branching moderately. Its flowers are tubular with a spur, featuring vibrant red petals and a yellow throat, blooming from summer to autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, dark seeds through dry dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes splendens is a tropical plant native to the eastern regions of South America, specifically Brazil and Colombia.</p>
<p>While it was once found in the wild, its current distribution is largely confined to cultivation due to habitat loss and over-collection. It thrives in warm, humid environments with well-drained soil, typically found in shaded forest understories. This species grows at elevations ranging from 300 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not officially listed as endangered, its wild populations are considered vulnerable due to limited habitat and declining numbers.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achimenes splendens is a vibrant tropical plant known for its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a short growing season, typically blooming in summer and going dormant in winter, making it a seasonal favorite in warm climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent moisture, though overwatering should be avoided to prevent root rot. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning after flowering help maintain its health and shape, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
