                <h1>Acnistus geminifolius</h1>
<p>Acnistus geminifolius, commonly known as the twinleaf mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features palmate leaves that are often divided into three to five lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in ecological studies and wetland restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus geminifolius has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, somewhat woody, and have a grayish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through dryness, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help the plant anchor in moist soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus geminifolius is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Madagascar and the island of Socotra. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within forests or along stream banks. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can thrive in both natural and cultivated environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the African continent, with no significant presence in other continents.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus geminifolius was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and fast growth rate.</p>
<p>It has since become invasive in several states, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by birds and water, leading to its rapid colonization of wetlands and disturbed areas. Its introduction has raised concerns among environmental managers due to its potential to disrupt ecological balance.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native plant communities.</p>
