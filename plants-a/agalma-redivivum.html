                    <h1>Agalma redivivum</h1>
<p>Agalma redivivum, commonly known as the resurrecting orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow at night. This unique trait is believed to be a result of specialized chloroplasts that store and release light energy. The plant is known for its ability to regrow from minimal tissue after being cut, a process that has earned it its common name.</p>
<p>Botanists are particularly interested in its genetic makeup, as it may hold clues to advanced regenerative capabilities in plants.</p>
