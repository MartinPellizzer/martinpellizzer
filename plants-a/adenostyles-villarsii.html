                <h1>Adenostyles villarsii</h1>
<p>Adenostyles villarsii, commonly known as the Sierra foothill bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, particularly in the Sierra Nevada foothills. The plant features basal rosettes of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Adenostyles villarsii is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in its native ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles villarsii has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are generally dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a spreading, shrub-like pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles villarsii is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and parts of Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as chaparral and coastal sage scrub. This plant thrives in regions with Mediterranean climates characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is often associated with serpentine soils, which are nutrient-poor and rich in heavy metals.</p>
<p>Adenostyles villarsii plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles villarsii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste areas, and along trails.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common invader in disturbed landscapes. This plant has a spreading growth habit and produces small, white to pink flowers that attract pollinators. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas contribute to its success as an introduced species.</p>
<p>However, it can outcompete native vegetation, leading to concerns about its ecological impact in non-native regions.</p>
