<p>Ayenia odonellii, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered in a star-like arrangement. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Ayenia odonellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-water conditions.</p>
