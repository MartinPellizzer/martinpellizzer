                <h1>Achillea lanulosa f. peroutkyi</h1>
<p>Achillea lanulosa f. peroutkyi, commonly known as the Peroutka's yarrow, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its finely hairy, grayish-green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe and thrives in well-drained, sunny soils. Its foliage and inflorescence are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Achillea lanulosa.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa f. peroutkyi has narrow, silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a pale green to grayish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-white composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa f. peroutkyi is a rare subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly found in Kazakhstan and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Altai Mountains. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, often growing on slopes and among sparse vegetation. It is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa f. peroutkyi is a compact, drought-tolerant perennial known for its fluffy, yellow flower heads and silvery foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, typically blooming in late spring to early summer and going dormant in the fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, especially once established. Light fertilization in early spring and regular pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa f. peroutkyi is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. This plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial interactions. Additionally, its deep root system helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and maintaining the health of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa f. peroutkyi is a perennial flowering plant known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its fluffy, yellow flower heads.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, it may be grown for its aesthetic appeal in horticultural settings. In traditional medicine, it may have been used for its potential anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation is limited. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and biodiversity in natural habitats.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in certain regions, though specific meanings are not widely documented.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa f. peroutkyi has several popular cultivars that are highly valued in gardens for their ornamental qualities, such as 'Purpurea' and 'Aurea', which display striking purple and yellow foliage respectively.</p>
<p>While it is not widely crossed with other species to form hybrids, some horticulturists have experimented with related achillea species to enhance its hardiness and bloom characteristics. This form is particularly prized for its silvery, woolly foliage and its ability to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils. Its horticultural importance lies in its role as a drought-tolerant plant that adds texture and interest to rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a favored choice among gardeners seeking to incorporate native or adaptive plants into their landscapes.</p>
