                <h1>Actinea torreyana</h1>
<p>Actinea torreyana, commonly known as the Torrey's actinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Actinea torreyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea torreyana has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a bright green color and a smooth, waxy texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green to grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its wetland habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea torreyana is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically from New York to Florida.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and thickets. This species thrives in areas with rich, organic soil and partial to full shade. It is often associated with eastern forests and is a member of the Araliaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea torreyana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the late 19th century in Washington State. The plant was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport via contaminated soil or seed. It has since become established in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
