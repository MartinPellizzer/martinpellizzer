<p>Acaena antarctica var. argutidentata, commonly known as the Antarctic hairynet, is a perennial shrub native to the Southern Hemisphere, particularly found in New Zealand and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit and small, persistent bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in cold, temperate climates and is often found in coastal and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
