                    <h1>Actinidia cylindrica f. obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Actinidia cylindrica f. obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leafed kiwifruit, is a variant of the Actinidia genus native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves with rounded tips, which distinguish it from the more commonly cultivated Actinidia deliciosa. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is similar to the common kiwifruit but is less commercially cultivated.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential for cultivation in temperate climates.</p>
