                <h1>Acrostichum lonchophyllum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum lonchophyllum, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lonchophyllum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are broad and leathery in texture, arranged alternately along the stem, with a deep green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark brown, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively and anchor itself in wetland habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lonchophyllum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific Ocean, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and the Caroline Islands.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and tidal forests. This plant is well adapted to saline and brackish water conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures throughout the year.</p>
<p>Acrostichum lonchophyllum plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lonchophyllum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions like Hawaii, Guam, and the Mariana Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites, often growing in dense stands. This plant is often associated with human activities, such as land clearing and landscaping, which have facilitated its spread. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems.</p>
