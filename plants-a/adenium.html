                    <h1>Adenium</h1>
<p>Adenium, commonly known as the "desert candle" or "upas tree," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped stem and thick, fleshy leaves, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces showy, often pink or red flowers that bloom in the summer. Adenium species are native to parts of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is sometimes referred to as a "poison plant," though it is also valued for its ornamental beauty and traditional uses.</p>
