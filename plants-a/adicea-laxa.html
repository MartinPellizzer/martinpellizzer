<p>Adicea laxa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional medicinal uses in local communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea laxa has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
