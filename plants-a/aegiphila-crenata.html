                <h1>Aegiphila crenata</h1>
<p>Aegiphila crenata, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in high-altitude regions with cool temperatures. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Aegiphila crenata is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila crenata has leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin and a dark green, glossy upper surface.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem and are relatively small, measuring up to 5 cm in length. The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly woody with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white or pale pink petals and a distinctive tubular shape, blooming in the spring and summer months, and are primarily pollinated by bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
