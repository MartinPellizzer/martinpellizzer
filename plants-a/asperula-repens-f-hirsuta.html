                    <h1>Asperula repens f. hirsuta</h1>
<p>Asperula repens f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy trailing azalea, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or shaded soils. Its hirsute (hairy) foliage is a distinguishing characteristic, providing texture and protection against environmental stress.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens.</p>
