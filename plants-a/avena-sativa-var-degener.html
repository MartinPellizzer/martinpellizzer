                    <h1>Avena sativa var. degener</h1>
<p>Avena sativa var. degener, commonly known as degenerate oat, is a botanical variant of the common oat.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced growth and often inferior grain quality compared to standard oat varieties. This variety is typically found in wild or weedy habitats due to its adaptability. Its genetic instability leads to variability in morphology and yield.</p>
<p>It is of interest in botanical studies for its genetic traits and ecological role.</p>
