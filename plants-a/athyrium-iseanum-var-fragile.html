<p>Athyrium iseanum var. fragile, commonly known as the fragile chain fern, is a delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a wiry, creeping rhizome and produces clusters of narrow, lance-shaped fronds with a soft, fern-like texture. The plant's fronds are typically light green and have a finely divided, feather-like appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature, it requires careful handling and is often cultivated in controlled settings.</p>
