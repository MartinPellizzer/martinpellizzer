                    <h1>Acianthera prolifera</h1>
<p>Acianthera prolifera, commonly known as the creeping orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. Acianthera prolifera thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth pattern allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in its native habitat.</p>
