                    <h1>Acantholobivia tegeleriana</h1>
<p>Acantholobivia tegeleriana, commonly known as the Tegeler's acantholobivia, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in parts of Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and clusters of vibrant yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its adaptations include thick, fleshy stems for water storage and reduced leaves to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
