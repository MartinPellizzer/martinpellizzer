<p>Atriplex tenuissima, commonly known as green burro bush, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Atriplex tenuissima is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
