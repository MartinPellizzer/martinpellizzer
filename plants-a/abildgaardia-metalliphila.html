                    <h1>Abildgaardia metalliphila</h1>
<p>Abildgaardia metalliphila, commonly known as the metalliferous plant, is a rare and specialized species native to metalliferous soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to hyperaccumulate heavy metals such as zinc and cadmium, making it an important subject in phytoremediation studies. The plant typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor environments, often found in areas with high metal contamination. Its morphology includes small, clustered leaves and a low-growing habit, which helps it thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a significant role in ecological research and environmental restoration efforts.</p>
