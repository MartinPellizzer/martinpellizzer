<p>Arthrophytum articulatum, commonly known as the artichoke cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, followed by small, edible fruits. Its leaves are typically spineless and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Arthrophytum articulatum is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
