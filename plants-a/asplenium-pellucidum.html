<p>Asplenium pellucidum, commonly known as the translucent holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a translucent appearance due to its thin, papery leaves. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Asplenium pellucidum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
