                <h1>Acystopteris japonica</h1>
<p>Acystopteris japonica, commonly known as the Japanese rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant produces small, kidney-shaped sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are typically located near the tips of the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocky surfaces.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acystopteris japonica has simple, fern-like leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure around 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green and glossy, with a serrated margin. The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. This plant does not produce flowers, as it is a fern and reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and spread horizontally through the soil, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acystopteris japonica is primarily native to China South-Central, China Southeast, and Japan.</p>
<p>This fern species is commonly found in moist, shaded environments within these regions. It thrives in forest understories and rocky crevices, where it benefits from high humidity and partial sunlight. The plant's distribution is closely tied to its preference for subtropical and temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its presence in these areas highlights its adaptation to diverse ecological conditions across East Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acystopteris japonica was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and shaded areas, often in urban and suburban settings. This fern thrives in moist, humid conditions and can rapidly colonize areas with poor soil quality. Its spread has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
