<p>Adiantum fragile var. rigidulum, commonly known as the rigid maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, bright green, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 15â€“30 cm long. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and thrives in well-draining, acidic soil. It is characterized by its unique, zigzagging fronds and the presence of small, spore-producing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is less commonly cultivated than its more robust relatives but is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care.</p>
