                    <h1>Arabis holboellii var. pendulocarpa</h1>
<p>Arabis holboellii var. pendulocarpa, commonly known as the weeping rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its pendulous, drooping inflorescences that give it a distinctive, weeping appearance. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>It produces small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
