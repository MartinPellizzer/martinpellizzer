                    <h1>Astrophytum myriostigma var. nudicarpa</h1>
<p>Astrophytum myriostigma var. nudicarpa, commonly known as the naked fruit barrel cactus, is a slow-growing, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick, globular stem that is typically covered in white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by fruits that are distinctively seedless, as the variety name "nudicarpa" refers to its lack of fruit. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly valued for its ability to thrive in dry, well-draining soil with minimal water.</p>
