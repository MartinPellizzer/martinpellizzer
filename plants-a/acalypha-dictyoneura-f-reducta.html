<p>Acalypha dictyoneura f. reducta belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, leaves, and roots. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises a group of vascular plants that includes horsetails and some fern allies. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a diverse group of flowering plants known for their varied morphological features and ecological adaptations. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes a wide range of plants with diverse growth forms and chemical compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "false holly," characterized by their showy flowers and often hairy leaves.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha dictyoneura, a specific type within the genus Acalypha, distinguished by its unique morphological traits and ecological preferences.</p>
