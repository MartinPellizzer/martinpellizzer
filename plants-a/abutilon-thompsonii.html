<p>Abutilon thompsonii, commonly known as the Thompson's abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features soft, fuzzy leaves and produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon thompsonii has leaves that are heart-shaped, with a velvety texture and a deep green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that exhibits a slightly fibrous texture. Its flowers are pendulous, with five petals, typically displaying a yellow or orange color, and bloom during the summer months; they are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon thompsonii is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States, specifically found in the southeastern region, including parts of Georgia, Florida, and Alabama.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in the coastal plains and lowland areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This species typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 300 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Abutilon thompsonii is considered endangered or threatened in many parts of its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon thompsonii is a fast-growing, deciduous shrub known for its showy, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy, maple-like leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-draining soil, requiring regular watering during the growing season but avoiding waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>Fertilize it with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
