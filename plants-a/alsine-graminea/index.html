                            <h1>Alsine Graminea</h1>
<p>Alsine graminea, commonly known as smooth sand-verbena, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as deserts and coastal dunes. The plant features small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle beauty to its arid environment. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important species for ecological studies and desert ecosystems. Despite its modest appearance, Alsine graminea plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
