<p>Anastraphia intertexta, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin stems and clustered, delicate flowers. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellow with intricate patterns, adapted to attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anastraphia intertexta is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
