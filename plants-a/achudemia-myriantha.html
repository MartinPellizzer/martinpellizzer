                <h1>Achudemia myriantha</h1>
<p>Achudemia myriantha, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, yellow, or orange. The plant features broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Achudemia myriantha is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achudemia myriantha has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achudemia myriantha is primarily native to the East Himalaya, Tibet.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in the mountainous regions of this area, where it is adapted to the high altitude and rugged terrain. It is commonly found in rocky and forested habitats at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. The species is well-suited to the cool and moist conditions typical of these regions.</p>
<p>Its natural distribution is limited to this specific geographic area, making it a regional endemic.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achudemia myriantha was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It was brought there by humans, likely as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since spread beyond its original introduction sites. It is now considered invasive in some areas of Hawaii.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions where it has established itself in native ecosystems.</p>
