                <h1>Achras pallida</h1>
<p>Achras pallida, commonly known as the white aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties.</p>
<p>Achras pallida is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras pallida has leaves that are broadly ovate to rounded, with a waxy, pale green surface and a silvery underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing as a solitary, upright shrub. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, clustered in inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spiny, globose capsule that splits open to release smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, anchoring the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras pallida is primarily native to the Caribbean, particularly the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and lowland forests. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity.</p>
<p>Its natural range is limited to these specific regions within the Caribbean archipelago.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras pallida was mainly introduced to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites due to its tolerance of salty and dry conditions. The plant has been reported in countries such as Cuba, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly its large, palm-like appearance.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
