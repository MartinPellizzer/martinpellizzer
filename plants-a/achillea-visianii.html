                <h1>Achillea visianii</h1>
<p>Achillea visianii, commonly known as the Visianian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features gray-green, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellow to white composite flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Achillea visianii is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea visianii has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and are typically gray-green in color, with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a clumping manner. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small achene, with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea visianii is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and calcareous soils, often growing in open, sunny habitats such as slopes, cliffs, and coastal areas. This plant is adapted to dry and semi-arid climates, which are characteristic of its native range. It is also known to occur in regions of Turkey, Greece, and the Balearic Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological preferences, it is not widely distributed beyond these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea visianii was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes across Europe and parts of North America. The plant is known for its resilience and ability to thrive in full sun, making it a popular choice for border planting and rock gardens. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread in non-native habitats.</p>
