                <h1>Achyronia purpurea</h1>
<p>Achyronia purpurea, commonly known as the purple achyronia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep purple. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia purpurea has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branched. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal spikes, featuring pinkish-purple petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia purpurea is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This plant is commonly found in the Florida Panhandle and along the Gulf Coast. It prefers sunny to partially shaded areas with consistently moist soil.</p>
<p>Its native range is largely confined to the southeastern coastal plains of the United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia purpurea was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its striking purple flowers and attractive foliage. Despite its beauty, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native plants in wetland and riparian habitats. Its rapid spread has led to concerns about ecological disruption and loss of biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are now underway to control its population and prevent further spread.</p>
