<p>Acanthophyllum bungei, commonly known as the desert holly, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow or green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum bungei plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small desert fauna.</p>
