                <h1>Acer negundo f. koehneanum</h1>
<p>Acer negundo f. koehneanum, commonly known as the Koehne's boxelder, is a variant of the boxelder tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are typically three-lobed, with a coarsely toothed margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by samaras that are distinctive for their three-winged structure. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streams.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer negundo f. koehneanum has palmate leaves that are typically 5-9 lobed, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 5 to 12 cm in diameter, exhibiting a bright green color during the growing season.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and often branched, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a fast-growing, spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, with greenish-white petals, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted for rapid growth and anchoring the plant in moist, disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer negundo f. koehneanum is a variant of the box elder tree native to western China, specifically in the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in specific mountainous regions, its current distribution includes cultivation in botanical gardens and horticultural collections around the world. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forest edges. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species with a conservation status of vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer negundo f. koehneanum is a variant of the boxelder tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves rapid initial growth followed by a slower maturation phase, typically reaching maturity within 10-15 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning should focus on shaping and removing dead or diseased branches.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with other native plants in a mixed woodland setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer negundo f. koehneanum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in urban landscapes, helping to improve air quality and reduce noise pollution. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, its rapid growth makes it effective for reforestation and habitat restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer negundo f. koehneanum is a variant of the box elder tree known for its adaptability and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its wood has been historically utilized in small-scale woodworking and crafting due to its lightweight and workability. In medicinal practices, some traditional uses have been reported, though scientific validation remains limited. Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in certain regions, representing resilience or adaptability.</p>
<p>Economically, it contributes to local ecosystems by providing habitat and supporting biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer negundo f. koehneanum has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Erectum' and 'Vestita', which are known for their unique growth forms and foliage.</p>
<p>It also has hybrids with other maple species, such as Acer negundo Ã— Acer saccharum, which are often used in horticultural breeding programs to enhance traits like cold hardiness and fall color. These hybrids and cultivars are particularly important in landscaping due to their adaptability to different climates and soil conditions. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in urban environments and its potential for genetic improvement.</p>
<p>Its unique characteristics make it a valuable addition to both public and private gardens.</p>
