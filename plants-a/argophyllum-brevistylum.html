                    <h1>Argophyllum brevistylum</h1>
<p>Argophyllum brevistylum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved argophyllum, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its habitat is often in sandy or rocky soils near the coast, where it is adapted to salt-laden winds and well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species.</p>
