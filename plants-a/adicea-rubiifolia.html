                <h1>Adicea rubiifolia</h1>
<p>Adicea rubiifolia, commonly known as the red-leafed dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features striking, velvety red foliage that turns vibrant orange in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries. Adicea rubiifolia thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and naturalized landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea rubiifolia has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, upright, and have a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea rubiifolia is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, woodlands, and along riverbanks in these regions. The plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high rainfall. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
<p>Adicea rubiifolia is an important component of the local flora and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea rubiifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
