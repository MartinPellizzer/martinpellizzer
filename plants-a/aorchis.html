                    <h1>Aorchis</h1>
<p>Aorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly forms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Aorchis has a short-lived flower that blooms only once every few years, making it a rare sight in the wild.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
