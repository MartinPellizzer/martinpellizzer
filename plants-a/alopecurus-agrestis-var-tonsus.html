<p>Alopecurus agrestis var. tonsus, commonly known as slender mouse-ear, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows, ditches, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often lie flat on the ground, and its leaves are narrow with a distinctive hairy texture. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is often confused with other Alopecurus species due to its similar appearance and growth habit.</p>
