<p>Angraecum calanthum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue with dark purple markings. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears several blooms, which are often fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Angraecum calanthum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and pollination strategy make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
