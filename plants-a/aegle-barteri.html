                <h1>Aegle barteri</h1>
<p>Aegle barteri, commonly known as the African star apple, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, glossy leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that give way to round, green fruits with a tough outer skin. The fruit contains a white, fleshy pulp surrounding a central core with edible seeds.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegle barteri has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, fragrant, and white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, blooming in the spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a smooth, round drupe that splits open to release glossy black seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, aiding in water absorption from the surrounding soil.</p>
