                    <h1>Asplenium × suevicum</h1>
<p>Asplenium × suevicum, commonly known as the hybrid spleenwort, is a fern native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium ruta-muraria, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its fronds are dark green and often have a leathery texture, with a distinctive arrangement of spore-bearing structures called sori.</p>
<p>Asplenium × suevicum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
