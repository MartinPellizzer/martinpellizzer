                    <h1>Acacia tortilis f. spirocarpa</h1>
<p>Acacia tortilis f. spirocarpa, commonly known as the spiral acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of thorns, which are often curved and twisted. The plant produces yellow flowers and flat, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various desert animals.</p>
