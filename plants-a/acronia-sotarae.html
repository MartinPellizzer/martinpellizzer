                <h1>Acronia sotarae</h1>
<p>Acronia sotarae, commonly known as the Sotarae acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many species with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in shades of white and pale yellow, and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acronia sotarae is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia sotarae has leaves that are ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia sotarae is primarily native to the island of Sotara in the southern Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>This rare plant is found exclusively in the coastal regions of the island, where it thrives in sandy soils. It is adapted to the tropical climate and high humidity of its native habitat. Due to its limited range, it is considered an endemic species of Sotara.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique plant from threats such as habitat destruction and invasive species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia sotarae was mainly introduced to the island of Sotara.</p>
<p>It was brought there by early settlers who sought to establish a variety of ornamental plants. The distribution of this species is limited to the coastal regions of the island. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found near the shoreline.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its introduced habitat.</p>
