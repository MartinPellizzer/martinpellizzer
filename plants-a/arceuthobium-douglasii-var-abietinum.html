                    <h1>Arceuthobium douglasii var. abietinum</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium douglasii var. abietinum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests coniferous trees such as firs and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship that can weaken the host over time. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals or wind. Its life cycle involves a complex interaction with its host, including the development of haustoria to absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its unique method of seed dispersal, where the seeds are catapulted from the fruit upon maturity.</p>
