                    <h1>Agrostis gigantea var. ramosa</h1>
<p>Agrostis gigantea var. ramosa, commonly known as giant bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with long, slender leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to form dense mats, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in wetland ecosystems.</p>
