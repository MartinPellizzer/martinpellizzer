                    <h1>Argusia cimmerica</h1>
<p>Argusia cimmerica, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Argusia cimmerica is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Its hardiness makes it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects in arid landscapes.</p>
