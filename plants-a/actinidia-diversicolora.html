                <h1>Actinidia diversicolora</h1>
<p>Actinidia diversicolora, commonly known as the Chinese mayapple, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that ripen to a bright red color in late summer. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Actinidia diversicolora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its foliage and fruit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia diversicolora has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes rough and fissured with age, and it grows as a climbing vine. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in axillary clusters, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a greenish-yellow, edible berry that ripens in late summer, and it is dispersed by birds and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia diversicolora is primarily native to eastern and central China, including regions such as Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hubei.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with moist, well-drained soils. This species is commonly found in mountainous areas and forested regions. It is also native to parts of Korea and northeastern India.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the humid and cool conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia diversicolora was mainly introduced to North America and Europe as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and edible berries.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, often escaping cultivation and establishing itself in woodland and riparian habitats. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types have contributed to its spread beyond its original introduction range. It is now considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread include mechanical removal and the use of herbicides in affected regions.</p>
