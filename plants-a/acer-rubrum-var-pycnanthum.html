                <h1>Acer rubrum var. pycnanthum</h1>
<p>Acer rubrum var. pycnanthum, commonly known as the red maple variety pycnanthum, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree typically grows to a height of 20â€“30 meters and features opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are green in summer. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and reddish-brown when young, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. pycnanthum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The flowers are small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-green sepals and red stamens, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a pair of samaras, each with a wing, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. pycnanthum is a rare variant of the red maple, native to the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in Tennessee and North Carolina. This variant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests, often near streams or in coves. It is typically found at elevations between 600 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. pycnanthum is a compact variety of red maple known for its vibrant fall color and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for germination. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 10-15 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be done sparingly in early spring, and pruning is recommended to maintain shape and remove dead branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally suffer from aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. pycnanthum is a valuable plant in forest ecosystems that provides food and shelter for a variety of wildlife.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its seeds are consumed by birds and small mammals. It acts as a companion plant in mixed hardwood forests, enhancing biodiversity and ecological stability. The plant also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that holds soil in place.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by supporting the growth of other plants through improved soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. pycnanthum is a variant of the red maple tree known for its ecological and ornamental value.</p>
