<p>Acer rubrum var. pycnanthum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn brilliant shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn. Its flowers are small, red, and clustered in pendulous catkins, appearing in early spring before the leaves.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age, and the tree produces samaras with two winged seeds.</p>
