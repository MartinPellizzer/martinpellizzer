                    <h1>Aegonychon zollingeri</h1>
<p>Aegonychon zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the misty cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring small, pale green leaves and a single, elongated flower with a distinctive, almost translucent bloom. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this elusive species from further decline.</p>
