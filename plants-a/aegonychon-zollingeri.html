                <h1>Aegonychon zollingeri</h1>
<p>Aegonychon zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the misty cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring small, pale green leaves and a single, elongated flower with a distinctive, almost translucent bloom. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this elusive species from further decline.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegonychon zollingeri has simple, alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender and slightly hairy, with a light brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with five petals and appear in early spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
