                        <h1>Acalypha infesta var. rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Acalypha infesta var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are typically ovate to round in shape, with a velvety texture and prominent veins. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It also serves as a food source for various insects and birds in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha infesta var. rotundifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats like forest edges and agricultural lands. It is also present in parts of Oceania, including Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other tropical regions around the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha infesta var. rotundifolia was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was initially brought there for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since spread rapidly and is now considered a noxious weed. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to significant ecological impacts on local ecosystems.</p>
