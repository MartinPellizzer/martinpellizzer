                    <h1>Astragalus oxyglottoides</h1>
<p>Astragalus oxyglottoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with narrow, linear leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in degraded areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Astragalus oxyglottoides is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats.</p>
