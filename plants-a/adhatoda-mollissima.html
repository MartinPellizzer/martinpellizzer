                <h1>Adhatoda mollissima</h1>
<p>Adhatoda mollissima, commonly known as the Indian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, making it a striking addition to gardens. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that contribute to its ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, thriving in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>Adhatoda mollissima is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda mollissima has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 4 to 10 centimeters in length, exhibiting a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a rough texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white to pale blue petals, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda mollissima is a medicinal plant native to tropical and southern Africa, particularly countries such as South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of India and Southeast Asia, where it has been introduced for its medicinal properties. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forests or along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is threatened by deforestation and land use changes, leading to concerns for its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda mollissima is a fast-growing, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions, known for its medicinal properties and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick establishment. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within one to two years under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and occasional pruning to shape the plant and promote bushiness are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally suffer from fungal infections if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adhatoda mollissima is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its showy flowers and nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by improving soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes the soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Adhatoda mollissima contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and maintaining a healthy ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
