                <h1>Aconitum arunii</h1>
<p>Aconitum arunii, commonly known as the Himalayan monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple spurred flowers. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, and it typically grows in moist, shady environments. Aconitum arunii contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum arunii has large, palmately compound leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated margin and a velvety texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes more rugged as the plant matures. Its flowers are showy and borne in dense, terminal clusters, featuring spurred petals in shades of blue to purple, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick and tuberous, serving as storage organs and aiding in the plant's survival in its alpine habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum arunii is primarily native to the East Himalaya.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India. This species typically grows at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. It thrives in temperate climates with cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is commonly found in forested areas and rocky slopes within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum arunii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
