<p>Abutilon hasslerianum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and rapid growth make it both a useful plant for erosion control and a potential invasive species in certain environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon hasslerianum is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. This species is well adapted to humid environments and is commonly found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has also been introduced to other parts of the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
