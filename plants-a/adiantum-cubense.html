                <h1>Adiantum cubense</h1>
<p>Adiantum cubense, commonly known as the Cuban maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that resemble the shape of a feather. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum cubense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum cubense has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a delicate, feathered appearance, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, measuring up to 15 cm in length, with a pale green color and a smooth, glossy surface. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a vertical pattern.</p>
<p>Adiantum cubense produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cubense is primarily native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba, the Bahamas, and parts of the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. This fern is commonly found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its distribution includes various island nations in the Caribbean Sea.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to the warm, humid climate of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cubense was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where its preferred humid and shaded environments can be found.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries across the Americas, including parts of Central and South America. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as forests, along stream banks, and in moist soils. Its introduction may be due to human activities like horticulture or accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
