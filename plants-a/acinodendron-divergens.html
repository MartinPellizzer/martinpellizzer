                <h1>Acinodendron divergens</h1>
<p>Acinodendron divergens, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and spiny, compound leaves. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron divergens has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth surface, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron divergens is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forests and is commonly found in secondary growth areas. This plant is also present in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. It prefers well-drained soil and is often associated with disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the biodiversity of the region's rainforests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron divergens was mainly introduced to the coastal areas of South Africa, particularly in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in the moist, saline environment. The plant was introduced for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fern-like foliage and its ability to tolerate coastal conditions. It has since become naturalized in these regions, forming dense thickets that can impact local biodiversity.</p>
<p>However, its spread is currently limited to specific coastal habitats and does not pose a major threat to native vegetation.</p>
