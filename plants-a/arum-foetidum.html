                    <h1>Arum foetidum</h1>
<p>Arum foetidum, commonly known as the stinkplant, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, arrow-shaped leaf that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces a spadix, a spiky structure surrounded by a showy, purple to green spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released from the spadix and attracts pollinators such as flies.</p>
