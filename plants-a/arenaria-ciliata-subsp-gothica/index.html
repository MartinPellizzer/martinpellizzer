                            <h1>Arenaria Ciliata Subsp. Gothica</h1>
<p>Ciliate sandwort, scientifically known as Arenaria ciliata subsp. gothica, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the cold, rocky environments of the Arctic and subarctic regions. This subspecies is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers and fine, hairy leaves that help it survive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in areas with strong winds and limited sunlight, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its ability to withstand extreme conditions makes it an important indicator species for ecological studies in polar regions. Despite its small size, the ciliate sandwort plays a vital role in maintaining the delicate balance of its ecosystem.</p>
