                <h1>Adinandra rostrata</h1>
<p>Adinandra rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated adenium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its thick, succulent stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>Adinandra rostrata is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra rostrata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a climbing or shrub-like pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra rostrata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forests, often growing in shaded understory conditions. This species is also present in parts of New Guinea and the Indian subcontinent. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adinandra rostrata is typically found in primary and secondary forests, often near rivers or in moist, forested areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra rostrata was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where there is a consistent supply of water, making it common in rainforests and along riverbanks. This plant is often found in secondary growth forests and can tolerate a range of soil types as long as they remain moist. Its introduction has been noted in several Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
