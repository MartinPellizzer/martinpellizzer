                <h1>Acinodendron hirtellum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron hirtellum, commonly known as the hairy acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy foliage, which give it its common name. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to several meters.</p>
<p>Acinodendron hirtellum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron hirtellum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elliptical to ovate leaflets that are typically green and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that develops fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small and clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron hirtellum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. This plant typically grows in humid lowland forests and is often associated with secondary vegetation. It thrives in areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron hirtellum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in parts of Central and South America. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including land clearing and the spread of invasive species.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a weed in non-native regions where it lacks natural predators.</p>
