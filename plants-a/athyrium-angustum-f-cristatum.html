                    <h1>Athyrium angustum f. cristatum</h1>
<p>Athyrium angustum f. cristatum, commonly known as the narrow fern with a crest, is a fern species characterized by its narrow, elongated fronds.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive crinkled or curled appearance, giving it its "cristatum" designation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical collections.</p>
