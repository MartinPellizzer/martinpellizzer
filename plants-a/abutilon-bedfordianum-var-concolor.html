<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon bedfordianum var. concolor has ovate to elliptical leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a waxy surface and a bluish-green color, ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slightly hairy, with a light green to grayish bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are pendulous, with a cup-shaped calyx and five pale yellow petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon bedfordianum var. concolor is a variant of the velvetleaf abutilon, native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is now distributed across parts of the southeastern United States, including Florida, as well as the Caribbean islands. This plant thrives in warm, humid environments, often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. It typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level to around 300 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions and is listed as a prohibited plant in several states.</p>
