<p>Agrostis canina subsp.</p>
<p>monteluccii, commonly known as the mountain mousegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its low growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in rugged terrain.</p>
