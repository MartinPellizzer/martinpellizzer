                    <h1>Antrophyum perrierianum</h1>
<p>Antrophyum perrierianum, commonly known as the Perrier's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is listed as critically endangered.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a unique subject of study in the field of plant evolution and conservation.</p>
