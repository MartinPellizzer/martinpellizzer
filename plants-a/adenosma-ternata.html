                <h1>Adenosma ternata</h1>
<p>Adenosma ternata, commonly known as the three-lobed adenosma, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries like India, China, and Indonesia. The plant typically grows as an erect herb with opposite, ovate leaves that have three distinct lobes. Its flowers are small and clustered in cymes, often displaying a white or pale pink color.</p>
<p>Adenosma ternata is characterized by its simple yet distinctive morphology, making it a notable species within its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma ternata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 3 to 6 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white to pale yellow petals, and they bloom from late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when the pod splits open, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma ternata is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical regions of this island, particularly in lowland and montane rainforests. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often seen growing along stream banks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its native range is largely confined to the eastern and western parts of New Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma ternata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments where it can thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in various regions beyond its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature.</p>
