<p>Anemia oblongifolia var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved anemia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, oval-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of the typical variety, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its foliage is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
