<p>Acer obtusatum f. daisaretica, commonly known as the Daisaretic maple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the obtusatum maple.</p>

The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Japan, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. Its compact growth habit and unique foliage make it a prized addition to botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>
