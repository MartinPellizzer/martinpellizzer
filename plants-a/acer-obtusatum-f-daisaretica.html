                <h1>Acer obtusatum f. daisaretica</h1>
<p>Acer obtusatum f. daisaretica, commonly known as the Daisaretic maple, is a unique variant of the obtusatum maple, characterized by its distinct foliage and growth habits.</p>
<p>This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value, featuring striking, palmately lobed leaves that range from bright green to red or bronze in autumn. It typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, with a compact, rounded form that makes it suitable for smaller gardens. The leaves are usually broader and more rounded than those of the species, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a versatile addition to temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum f. daisaretica has leaves that are broadly ovate to round in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, and a lighter green underside; they are alternate in arrangement and typically measure 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in upright racemes, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with a winged seed, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum f. daisaretica is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it is now cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections across Europe and North America. This plant thrives in humid, temperate climates with well-drained, acidic soils, typically found in shaded forest understories. It is commonly found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and rarity in the wild, it is considered a conservation concern and is often protected in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum f. daisaretica is a unique ornamental maple known for its striking foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings or seed, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This slow-growing plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soil, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilize it with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, and prune selectively to shape the plant and remove any dead or diseased branches.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care and companion plants like lavender or yarrow to enhance its health and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum f. daisaretica is a unique plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, red flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its dense growth helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil on slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a variety of life forms within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
