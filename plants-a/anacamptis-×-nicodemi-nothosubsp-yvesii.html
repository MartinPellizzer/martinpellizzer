<p>Anacamptis × nicodemi nothosubsp.</p>
<p>yvesii, commonly known as the Yves' hybrid orchid, is a rare and naturally occurring hybrid within the Orchidaceae family. It exhibits a combination of morphological traits from its parent species, Anacamptis morio and Anacamptis pyramidalis, resulting in unique floral characteristics.</p>
<p>The plant typically produces tall, erect stems with showy, spurred flowers in shades of purple and white. It thrives in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soil, often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
