<p>Actiniopteris australis var. radiata, commonly known as the radiate sea palm, is a marine plant found in coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>

The plant thrives in shallow, sheltered waters where it attaches itself to rocks or other substrates. Its structure resembles that of a small, branching sea grass, with small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various marine organisms.</p>
