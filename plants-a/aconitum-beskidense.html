                <h1>Aconitum beskidense</h1>
<p>Aconitum beskidense, commonly known as the Beskids aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian Basin.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed divisions, and are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Aconitum beskidense is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in forested areas and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum beskidense has large, compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing upright and branching towards the top. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with spurred petals and a tubular shape, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum beskidense is primarily native to the Beskid Mountains in southern Poland.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the Carpathian Basin, specifically in the regions of the Beskid and Pieniny Mountains. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments at elevations ranging from 800 to 1,600 meters. The species is commonly found in open, sunny areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes meadows, slopes, and rocky outcrops in these mountain ranges.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum beskidense was mainly introduced to the European Alps and surrounding mountain ranges.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the Beskid Mountains of southern Poland, from which it gets its name. The plant has since spread to other parts of Europe, including the Carpathians and the Pyrenees. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain habitats.</p>
