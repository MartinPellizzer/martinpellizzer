                <h1>Acronychia endlicheri</h1>
<p>Acronychia endlicheri, commonly known as the white sand acronychia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fragrant, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia endlicheri has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they are typically 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, clustered in inflorescences, and bloom during the dry season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody drupe, containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia endlicheri is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland rainforest environments, often growing in the understory where it receives dappled sunlight. This species is commonly found in areas with well-drained, fertile soils and a warm, moist climate. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia endlicheri was mainly introduced to urban and coastal areas for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in parks, along roadsides, and in residential landscapes due to its tolerance of various environmental conditions. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in natural habitats, sometimes competing with native species. It is considered an invasive species in some regions where it has spread beyond cultivated areas.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
