<p>Asplenium × jacksonii, commonly known as the Jackson's spleenwort, is a hybrid fern that results from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its dense, compact growth and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically forms a rosette of leaves that are covered in tiny, spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rock crevices or on tree trunks.</p>
<p>Asplenium × jacksonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a humid indoor setting.</p>
