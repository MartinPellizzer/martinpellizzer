                <h1>Acer oblongum var. latialatum</h1>
<p>Acer oblongum var. latialatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5–10 cm in length, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and autumn coloration.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. latialatum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn yellow to orange in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. latialatum is a variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern Asia, including parts of China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and environmental changes. This species thrives in temperate climates, typically in moist, well-drained soils found in forested areas. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The conservation status of Acer oblongum var. latialatum is considered vulnerable, as it faces threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. latialatum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant fall color and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or softwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. This tree grows best in a temperate climate, entering a dormant phase in winter and actively growing in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or garlic can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. latialatum is a valuable component of forest ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the pollination of other plants in the area. The dense canopy of this tree acts as a companion plant, supporting biodiversity by creating microhabitats for birds and insects. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil quality by facilitating nutrient cycling through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. latialatum is a lesser-known variant of the maple tree, primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture and landscaping due to its unique foliage and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas in some regions. In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for its potential anti-inflammatory properties, though research remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to the timber industry, providing durable wood for construction and furniture.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and adaptability, often featured in local art and folklore in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. latialatum has several popular cultivars such as 'Elegantum' and 'Crimson King,' which are prized for their striking foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It also serves as a parent in various hybrids, including those that combine its ornamental traits with the hardiness of other maple species. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced coloration and improved cold tolerance, making them more adaptable to different climates. The variety's unique leaf shape and seasonal color changes contribute to its horticultural importance in ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is widely cultivated in parks, gardens, and as street trees.</p>
