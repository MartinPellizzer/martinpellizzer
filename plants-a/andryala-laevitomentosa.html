                    <h1>Andryala laevitomentosa</h1>
<p>Andryala laevitomentosa, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found on rocky slopes and in sandy soils. The plant features small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense, silky layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Andryala laevitomentosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to climate stress.</p>
