<p>Abroma sinuosum, commonly known as the wavy abroma, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with wavy margins. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers that are borne in terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abroma sinuosum has alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually 5-10 cm long, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal panicles, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from September to November, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, oblong seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>
