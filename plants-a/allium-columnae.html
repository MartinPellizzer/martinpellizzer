                    <h1>Allium columnae</h1>
<p>Allium columnae, commonly known as the columnar garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting a dense cluster of small, pale purple to white flowers. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps it survive in harsh, alpine conditions. Its bulbs are smaller than those of common garlic and have a mild, aromatic flavor.</p>
<p>Allium columnae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display.</p>
