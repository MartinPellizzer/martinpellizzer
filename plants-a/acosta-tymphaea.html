                <h1>Acosta tymphaea</h1>
<p>Acosta tymphaea, commonly known as the mountain morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Acosta tymphaea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta tymphaea has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an ascending growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta tymphaea is primarily native to South America, specifically the Andean regions of Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the high-altitude grasslands and mountainous areas of these countries. This plant thrives in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with rocky outcrops and dry habitats.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic locations within the Andes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta tymphaea was mainly introduced to areas with moist, temperate climates, particularly in regions where it can thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, riverbanks, and open woodlands. The plant has been reported in several countries across Europe and parts of North America. Its introduction is often associated with human activity, including horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
