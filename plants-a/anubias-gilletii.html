<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its broad, dark green, arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Anubias gilletii is often used in aquariums due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its tolerance to a wide range of water parameters.</p>
