                    <h1>Anthipsimus</h1>
<p>Anthipsimus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in the canopy of pine flatwoods. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Anthipsimus is considered endangered and requires careful protection.</p>
