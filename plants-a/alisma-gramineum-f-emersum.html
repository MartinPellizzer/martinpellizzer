<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit, with leaves that rise above the water surface. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, white flowers that are arranged in a spike, typically blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and wet meadows.</p>
