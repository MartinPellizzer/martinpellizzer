<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea anethifolia has leaves that are lance-shaped, finely divided, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a gray-green color and a silvery appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age, growing in a bushy pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish-white composite heads composed of many tiny florets, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, disk-like achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in various habitats.</p>
