<p>Achillea anethifolia, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of anise, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is known for its aromatic foliage and is often used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Achillea anethifolia is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea anethifolia has leaves that are compound, with finely divided, fern-like lobes, arranged alternately along the stem, and are typically gray-green in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and smooth, with a light green to reddish-brown color, and grows in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called umbels, and bloom from late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, allowing wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish in various environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
