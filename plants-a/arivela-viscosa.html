                    <h1>Arivela viscosa</h1>
<p>Arivela viscosa, commonly known as the sticky arivela, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, viscid leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forest understories.</p>
<p>The sticky resin from its leaves has been used traditionally by some indigenous communities for various purposes.</p>
