<p>Anthocercis anisantha subsp.</p>
<p>collina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh climatic conditions and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
