                <h1>Aconitum tuoliense</h1>
<p>Aconitum tuoliense, commonly known as the Tibetan aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Tibet and adjacent areas in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply cut lobes, and it thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Aconitum tuoliense contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum tuoliense has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are typically large, with a bright green color and deeply lobed margins.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat hairy, with a rough, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in racemes, and consist of five petal-like sepals and two showy petals, blooming in late summer to early autumn; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tuoliense is primarily native to Xinjiang.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of Xinjiang, particularly in the western and northern parts of the region. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. The species is adapted to the cold and arid climate of the area.</p>
<p>It is an important part of the local flora and is often found in association with other high-altitude plant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tuoliense was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in mountainous or forested regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with high humidity and cool summers. This plant is commonly cultivated in gardens for its striking blue or purple flowers. It prefers rich, loamy soil and can tolerate some degree of frost.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in certain regions where it can outcompete native species.</p>
