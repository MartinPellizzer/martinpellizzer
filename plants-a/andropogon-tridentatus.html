<p>Andropogon tridentatus, commonly known as three-angled grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, slender flowering stalks that bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a distinctive three-angled stem, which contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Andropogon tridentatus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils.</p>
