                <h1>Achoriphragma sauricum</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma sauricum, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, succulent stems that help it retain water in harsh environments. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Achoriphragma sauricum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma sauricum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are glossy green in color and measure approximately 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in spikes, bloom during the summer months, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma sauricum is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with forested or shrubland habitats. It is a member of the Apiaceae family and is known for its aromatic leaves and flowers.</p>
<p>Achoriphragma sauricum is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma sauricum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often along stream banks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists in New Zealand.</p>
