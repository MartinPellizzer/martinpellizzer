<p>Achoriphragma sauricum, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, succulent stems that help it retain water in harsh environments. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Achoriphragma sauricum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
