The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Arundarbor amahussana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>
