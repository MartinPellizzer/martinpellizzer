<p>Athyrium badium, commonly known as the yellow holly fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly found in regions of China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often tinged with yellow or golden hues. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, allowing it to spread and form colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
