                    <h1>Andrachne aspera var. maritima</h1>
<p>Andrachne aspera var. maritima, commonly known as sea sandmat, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its succulent leaves are adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils, making it well-suited to coastal habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in dunes and rocky shores, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
