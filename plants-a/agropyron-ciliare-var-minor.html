<p>Agropyron ciliare var. minor, commonly known as the lesser wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop.</p>
