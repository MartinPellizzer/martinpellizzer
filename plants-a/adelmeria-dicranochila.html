                <h1>Adelmeria dicranochila</h1>
<p>Adelmeria dicranochila, commonly known as the silverleaf huckleberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces clusters of white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, edible berries.</p>
<p>Adelmeria dicranochila is an important plant for local wildlife, providing food for birds and mammals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelmeria dicranochila has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green color and a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Its stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically reddish-brown in color, and it grows as an erect shrub. The flowers are white, bell-shaped, and clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelmeria dicranochila is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of Luzon, particularly in the western part of the island. This plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing in dense forests. It is a rare and endemic species, known for its unique floral characteristics.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution highlights the importance of conservation efforts in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelmeria dicranochila was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, particularly in Oregon and Washington. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with maritime environments. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded due to human activities such as landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
