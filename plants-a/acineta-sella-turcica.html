                <h1>Acineta sella-turcica</h1>
<p>Acineta sella-turcica, commonly known as the Turkish saddle cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Turkey and is characterized by its distinctive saddle-shaped stem. The plant has a short, thick stem that is often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acineta sella-turcica has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows in a creeping or prostrate manner. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with four petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta sella-turcica is primarily native to Costa Rica and Panam√°.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical regions of these countries. It thrives in humid, forested environments. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within these nations.</p>
<p>It is not found outside of these geographic regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta sella-turcica was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region, particularly in areas with rocky and calcareous soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as southern Europe, northern Africa, and parts of the Middle East. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained environments and is often associated with dry and semi-arid climates. Its introduction has been linked to both natural dispersal and human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become established in several non-native areas beyond its original range.</p>
