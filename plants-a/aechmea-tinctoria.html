                <h1>Aechmea tinctoria</h1>
<p>Aechmea tinctoria, commonly known as the crimson bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that encase the inflorescence, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool used for attracting pollinators. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, greenish-white blooms.</p>
<p>Aechmea tinctoria is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea tinctoria has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, fleshy, and acuminate, arranged in a dense spiral at the base of the plant, with a striking blue-green color that becomes more intense in full sun.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, dark green bark that grows upward from the base of the rosette. Its flowers are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence, consisting of bright red bracts with white or pale yellow flowers, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind and animals after ripening.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense mat around the base of the plant, helping to anchor it and absorb moisture.</p>
