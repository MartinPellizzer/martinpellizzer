                <h1>Acinodendron ellipticum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron ellipticum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, narrow leaves and produces small, white to yellowish flowers. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ellipticum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale gray bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green in color, have five petals, and bloom in early spring; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ellipticum is primarily native to the eastern Himalayas, including regions in India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with mixed evergreen and deciduous forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ellipticum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of an ornamental plant collection. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. It is now considered a potential environmental weed due to its ability to spread rapidly.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
