                    <h1>Anoectochilus eldorado</h1>
<p>Anoectochilus eldorado, commonly known as the Eldorado orchid, is a rare and highly sought-after species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and striking, dark green to purple-tinged leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role within its montane forest ecosystem.</p>
