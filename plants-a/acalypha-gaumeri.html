                        <h1>Acalypha gaumeri</h1>
<p>Acalypha gaumeri, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. Its small, inconspicuous true flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences called cyathia.</p>
<p>Acalypha gaumeri thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded areas with well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha gaumeri belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which consists of vascular plants that include ferns and horsetails, known for their complex vascular systems. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a group of flowering plants that includes many tropical species with a wide range of morphological diversity. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse growth forms and often contains latex-producing species. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf," characterized by their showy bracts and often hairy foliage.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha gaumeri, a specific type of velvetleaf known for its unique floral structures and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha gaumeri is primarily native to Mexico Southeast.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the southern regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Veracruz. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas within forests. The species is commonly associated with humid lowland environments.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific regions in southeastern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha gaumeri was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become established in certain lowland areas. The plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native ecosystems.</p>
