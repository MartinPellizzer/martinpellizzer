                <h1>Adicea griffithii</h1>
<p>Adicea griffithii, commonly known as the Himalayan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Adicea griffithii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea griffithii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea griffithii is primarily native to the western Himalayas, including regions of India, Nepal, and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. The plant thrives in temperate climates with cool summers and cold winters. It is often associated with moist, well-drained soils in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Adicea griffithii is a rare species, with limited distribution due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea griffithii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in during the early 20th century as part of ornamental plant introductions. The plant has since established itself in moist, shaded environments along stream banks and forest floors. Its spread has been limited due to its specific habitat requirements.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in the area and is monitored to prevent further expansion.</p>
