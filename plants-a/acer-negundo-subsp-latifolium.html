                <h1>Acer negundo subsp. latifolium</h1>
<p>Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>latifolium, commonly known as the box elder, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which typically have three to five lobes, and its smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common but sometimes invasive species in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>latifolium has broad, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm long, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface and lighter green underside. The leaves are alternate in arrangement and turn vibrant yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and the plant grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>latifolium is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, particularly the United States and Canada. While it was originally found in the northern United States and southern Canada, its current distribution includes parts of Europe and Asia due to human introduction.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in riparian zones, floodplains, and along streams. This species typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>It is considered a non-native invasive species in many regions outside its native range, leading to concerns about its conservation status and ecological impact.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>latifolium is a hardy deciduous tree known for its rapid growth and adaptability. It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot under poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like clover can enhance soil fertility.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>latifolium is a versatile plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing soil structure and promoting the growth of other species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat in urban and rural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>latifolium is a versatile plant with various uses and applications. While its leaves are not typically used in culinary contexts, the plant has been historically utilized in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>In industrial and economic terms, it contributes to ecological restoration projects due to its fast growth and adaptability to various soil types. Culturally, it is sometimes admired for its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and is used in ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents resilience and adaptability in certain ecological and environmental contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>latifolium has several popular cultivars such as 'Autumn Flame' and 'Emerald Queen', which are valued for their vibrant fall color and ornamental appeal. It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, resulting in unique varieties that exhibit enhanced growth habits and visual characteristics.</p>
<p>These hybrids are often used in landscape design due to their adaptability to various soil conditions. The species and its cultivars hold significant horticultural importance for their ability to thrive in urban environments. Overall, Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>latifolium remains a favored choice for both residential and public gardening.</p>
