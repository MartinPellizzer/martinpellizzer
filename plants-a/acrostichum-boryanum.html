                <h1>Acrostichum boryanum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum boryanum, commonly known as the Boryanum fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum boryanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum boryanum has leaves that are long, narrow, and sword-shaped, arranged in a linear fashion along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in moist environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum boryanum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in wetland and marshy habitats. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with coastal areas and riverbanks. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, known for its grass-like appearance and adaptability to waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed outside of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum boryanum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, waste grounds, and along riverbanks. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded environments. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems.</p>
