                <h1>Acrolophus rigidulus</h1>
<p>Acrolophus rigidulus, commonly known as the rigid hairgrass, is a species of grass native to various regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and stiff, upright blades that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches.</p>
<p>Acrolophus rigidulus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolophus rigidulus has narrow, elongated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly rough as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green in color, with a simple structure, and they bloom in late spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolophus rigidulus is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in states such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often associated with desert scrub and grassland habitats. It is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely linked to the unique ecological conditions of the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolophus rigidulus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as trade and transportation.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, waste grounds, and agricultural fields. This plant thrives in temperate climates and can tolerate a range of soil conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce vegetatively contribute to its successful establishment in non-native regions.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
