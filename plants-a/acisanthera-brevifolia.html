                <h1>Acisanthera brevifolia</h1>
<p>Acisanthera brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand arid conditions.</p>
<p>Acisanthera brevifolia is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acisanthera brevifolia has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its small, white flowers are clustered in racemes, bloom during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in the plant's ability to absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera brevifolia is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and other humid lowland areas. This plant thrives in shaded understory environments with high humidity and nutrient-rich soil. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, its distribution is relatively limited compared to other plant species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera brevifolia was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, moist environments and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and forest edges. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering structure. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native regions, sometimes becoming invasive.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread into native ecosystems.</p>
