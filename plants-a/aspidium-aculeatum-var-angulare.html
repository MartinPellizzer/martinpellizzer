                    <h1>Aspidium aculeatum var. angulare</h1>
<p>Aspidium aculeatum var. angulare, commonly known as the angular water fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf water fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern native to wetland and aquatic environments in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features fronds with a distinctive angular appearance, characterized by sharply serrated margins. Its rhizomes are submerged, allowing it to anchor in muddy or aquatic substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in moist habitats.</p>
