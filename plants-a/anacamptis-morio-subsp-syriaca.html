<p>Anacamptis morio subsp.</p>
<p>syriaca, commonly known as the Syrian narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear to lanceolate leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, elongated spike bearing several pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
