                <h1>Acrostichum viscidulum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum viscidulum, commonly known as the sticky fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant's fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive sticky surface, which gives it its common name. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Acrostichum viscidulum is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other humid habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum viscidulum has long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and creeping, with a smooth, light green bark that grows horizontally along the ground. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum viscidulum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, moist soil, often found near rivers and in dense tropical forests. This plant is commonly associated with coastal and swampy environments, where it forms dense thickets. It is also found in parts of the Caribbean, including the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends into some regions of southern Florida in the United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum viscidulum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in swampy regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates where humidity is consistently high. This plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in invaded habitats. Its introduction has been linked to human activities such as land clearing and the spread of ornamental plants.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can outcompete native species and alter local ecosystems.</p>
