                <h1>Acrotriche dura</h1>
<p>Acrotriche dura, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help conserve water. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers are typically white or pale purple, blooming in the early morning.</p>
<p>Acrotriche dura has adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotriche dura has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale greenish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche dura is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the areas around the Fitzgerald River National Park and the Stirling Range. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland heathlands. It is well adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of the region.</p>
<p>Acrotriche dura is an important component of the local flora and is often found in open vegetation types.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche dura was mainly introduced to areas with sandy soils and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. This plant has been introduced to several countries in southern Europe, including Spain and Italy. It is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly.</p>
