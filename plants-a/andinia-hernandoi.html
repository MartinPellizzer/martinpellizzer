<p>Andinia hernandoi, commonly known as the Hernando's ghostflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is notable for its unique morphology, featuring a short stem with a single umbel of tiny, showy blooms. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Andinia hernandoi is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
