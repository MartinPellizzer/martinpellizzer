<p>Alsophila pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feather-like fronds that can grow quite large. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that supports its vertical structure. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, meaning they have a double division, giving the plant a lush, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Alsophila pacifica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas.</p>
