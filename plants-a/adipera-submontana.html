                <h1>Adipera submontana</h1>
<p>Adipera submontana, commonly known as the mountain adipera, is a herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous roots. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a compact, sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Adipera submontana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adipera submontana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows in a creeping or ascending manner. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipera submontana is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern South America, specifically in Argentina, Chile, and parts of Peru.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level. This species is commonly found in rocky soils and among alpine vegetation in the Andes mountain range. It is well adapted to the cold, dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, its distribution is relatively limited and localized.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipera submontana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest environments. This plant has been reported in several states including Oregon and Washington. It is often associated with disturbed soils and can thrive in areas with partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among local ecologists due to its potential to outcompete native flora.</p>
