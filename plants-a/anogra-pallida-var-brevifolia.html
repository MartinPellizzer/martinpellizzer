<p>Anogra pallida var. brevifolia, commonly known as the pale anogra, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale yellow to cream in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland borders.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
