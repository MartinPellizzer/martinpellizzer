                <h1>Aegiphila dentata</h1>
<p>Aegiphila dentata, commonly known as the toothed aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves with serrated edges, giving it its common name. It produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Aegiphila dentata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila dentata has leaves that are elliptical to lanceolate in shape, with serrated margins and a dark green upper surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, hairy, and has a grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white with five petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
