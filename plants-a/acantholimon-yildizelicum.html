<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and their closest algal relatives, characterized by their complex structures and photosynthetic capabilities. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a long evolutionary history, including ferns and horsetails. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many primitive angiosperms with diverse morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants known for their distinctive flowers and often containing plants with specialized adaptations to arid environments. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly known as the leadwort family, characterized by their often showy flowers and medicinal properties. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, known for their succulent leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon yildizelicum, a specific plant species within the genus Acantholimon, native to Turkey, characterized by its unique morphological traits and ecological adaptations.</p>
