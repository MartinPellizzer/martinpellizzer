<p>Acacia leprosa, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces flat, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds, which are a traditional food source for some indigenous communities. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Acacia leprosa is also valued for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it an important component of its native ecosystem.</p>
