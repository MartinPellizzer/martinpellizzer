<p>Aliella embergeri, commonly known as the Emberger's sandwort, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Aliella embergeri is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
