<p>Aegilops aucheri var. virgata, commonly known as the slender wild wheat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to white florets. It is often found in disturbed habitats and can thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic relationship with wheat, it has been studied for its potential in agricultural improvement.</p>
