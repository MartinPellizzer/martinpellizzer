                <h1>Achillea millefolium var. alpestris</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. alpestris, commonly known as alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. alpestris has leaves that are finely divided, feather-like, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a silvery white underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing in a clumping pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and form flat-topped clusters, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. alpestris is a variant of yarrow that is native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Alps and Carpathians.</p>
<p>Currently, it is distributed across various alpine and subalpine areas in Europe, including parts of Scandinavia, the Pyrenees, and the Balkans. It thrives in open, well-drained soils in rocky or grassy environments, often found in meadows, pastures, and along mountain trails. This plant typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>It is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status due to its wide distribution and adaptability to its habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. alpestris is a hardy perennial that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer, ensuring a robust and healthy growth cycle. The plant prefers dry to moderately moist conditions, requiring minimal watering once established, and benefits from a light application of compost in early spring. Regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourages new growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, yarrow, or sedum enhances its ornamental value and supports a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. alpestris is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen for pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while also offering shelter and habitat for small insects and wildlife.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of pollinators due to its bright yellow flowers and abundant nectar sources. This plant acts as an erosion control measure due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil in rocky and alpine environments. It also serves as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by attracting beneficial insects.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. alpestris is a variant of yarrow known for its various uses across different fields.</p>
<p>In culinary applications, it is occasionally used as a seasoning due to its mild, peppery flavor.

Industrially, it contributes to the ecological balance by supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in alpine environments.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes protection and healing, often appearing in folklore and traditional medicine practices.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. alpestris has several popular cultivars such as 'Aurea', known for its bright yellow foliage, and 'Purpurascens', which features purple-tinged leaves.</p>
<p>It also has hybrids with other Achillea species, resulting in plants with enhanced hardiness and extended blooming periods. These varieties are prized in horticulture for their drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. They are widely used in rock gardens and as border plants due to their ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Their versatility makes them a favored choice for both novice and experienced gardeners.</p>
