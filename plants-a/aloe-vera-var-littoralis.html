                    <h1>Aloe vera var. littoralis</h1>
<p>Aloe vera var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal aloe, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is adapted to grow in sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray from the ocean.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in coastal gardens.</p>
