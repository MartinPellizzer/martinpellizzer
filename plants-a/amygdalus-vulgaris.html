                    <h1>Amygdalus vulgaris</h1>
<p>Amygdalus vulgaris, commonly known as the common almond, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deciduous nature, producing clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant's fruits are drupes, containing a single seed encased in a hard shell, which is the source of the edible almond. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while the bark is smooth and grayish in color.</p>
<p>Amygdalus vulgaris is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its economic importance in the production of almonds and almond oil.</p>
