                    <h1>Angiopteris madagascariensis</h1>
<p>Angiopteris madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar water fern, is a species of fern native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Angiopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive U-shaped structure that aids in buoyancy.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
