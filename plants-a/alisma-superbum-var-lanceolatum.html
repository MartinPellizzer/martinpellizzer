                    <h1>Alisma superbum var. lanceolatum</h1>
<p>Alisma superbum var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and improve water filtration in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to fluctuating water levels.</p>
