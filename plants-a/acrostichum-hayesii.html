<p>Acrostichum hayesii, commonly known as Hayes' holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen fronds, which remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping underground stems that help it spread. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
