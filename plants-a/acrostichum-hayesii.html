                <h1>Acrostichum hayesii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum hayesii, commonly known as Hayes' holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen fronds, which remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping underground stems that help it spread. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hayesii has large, feather-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a dark green color and a leathery texture, arranged in a basal rosette.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stout, with a rough, fibrous bark that is typically brown in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spadices, with a greenish-yellow color, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are lightweight and adapted for aerial dissemination.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hayesii is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including the Lesser Antilles and parts of the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove swamps and salt marshes. This plant thrives in brackish or saline environments, often growing in tidal zones. Its distribution is limited to specific regions where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hayesii was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the coastal regions of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of freshwater marshes. This plant has been documented in both natural and human-altered habitats, often thriving in areas with high moisture levels. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several states, where it sometimes competes with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential in some areas, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits.</p>
