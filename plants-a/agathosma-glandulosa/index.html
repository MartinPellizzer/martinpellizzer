                            <h1>Agathosma Glandulosa</h1>
<p>Agathosma glandulosa, commonly known as Cape spearmint, is a fragrant evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. This plant is prized for its essential oils, which are widely used in aromatherapy and natural perfumery. Its distinctive appearance features small, needle-like leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid climates. Despite its hardy nature, it is often cultivated for its medicinal and aromatic properties.</p>
