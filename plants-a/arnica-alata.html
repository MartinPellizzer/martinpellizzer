<p>Arnica alata, commonly known as the slender mountain arnica, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Arnica alata produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties, though its use is limited due to its toxicity.</p>
