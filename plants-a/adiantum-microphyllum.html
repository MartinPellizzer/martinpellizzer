                <h1>Adiantum microphyllum</h1>
<p>Adiantum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its fronds are characterized by their slender, arching appearance and the presence of tiny, translucent glands along the leaf margins.</p>
<p>Adiantum microphyllum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum microphyllum has delicate, finely divided leaves that are triangular in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure about 10-20 cm in length, with a bright green color that turns bronze in autumn.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, with a structure consisting of separate sepals and stamens, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum microphyllum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in humid lowland forests. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often associated with streamside habitats. It is also known to occur in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across various island nations in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum microphyllum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites and can spread rapidly in wet environments. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth habits.</p>
