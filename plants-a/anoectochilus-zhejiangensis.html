                    <h1>Anoectochilus zhejiangensis</h1>
<p>Anoectochilus zhejiangensis, commonly known as the Zhejiang slipper orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique slipper-shaped flower pouch, which is a distinctive feature of the Anoectochilus genus. The plant typically grows as a lithophyte, attaching itself to rocky substrates in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are usually ovate and covered with a dense layer of fine, hairy structures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region.</p>
