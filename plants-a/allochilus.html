                    <h1>Allochilus</h1>
<p>Allochilus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate appearance, with white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Native to the wetlands of South America, particularly in Brazil, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly dependent on its symbiotic relationships.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Allochilus is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts.</p>
