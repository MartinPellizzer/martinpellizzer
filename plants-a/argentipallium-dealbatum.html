<p>Argentipallium dealbatum, commonly known as the silver-pale lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Verrucariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale gray to silver-colored thallus, which is typically crustose in growth form. The lichen thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on bark or soil surfaces in temperate regions. Its morphology includes a complex arrangement of fungal hyphae and algal cells that work together to absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to mycologists and botanists due to its ecological role and potential use in environmental monitoring.</p>
