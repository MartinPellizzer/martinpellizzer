                <h1>Adoxa corydalifolia</h1>
<p>Adoxa corydalifolia, commonly known as sweet peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that resemble small bells, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Adoxa corydalifolia is a member of the Adoxaceae family, which also includes plants like the sweet pepper.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adoxa corydalifolia has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 2–5 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often branched, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, clustered in umbels, and bloom in late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adoxa corydalifolia is primarily native to Qinghai.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of this province. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments within its native habitat. It is often associated with forested areas and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Qinghai's diverse landscape.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adoxa corydalifolia was mainly introduced to the northeastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>It has since spread into natural areas, often thriving in moist, shaded environments. The plant is considered invasive in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species. Its introduction has led to concerns about ecological disruption in wetland and forested habitats.</p>
<p>Management strategies are being developed to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
