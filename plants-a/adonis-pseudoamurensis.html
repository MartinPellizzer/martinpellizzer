<p>It belongs to the Papaveraceae family, which includes poppies and other flowering plants. The plant features delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Adonis pseudoamurensis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis pseudoamurensis has compound leaves that are pinnate, with lance-shaped leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, and they are generally green with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a reddish-brown color, and it grows in a branching pattern.

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis pseudoamurensis is primarily native to Korea and Manchuria.</p>
<p>It is found in the temperate regions of these areas. The plant typically grows in forested or mountainous environments. It is adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific regions in East Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis pseudoamurensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been observed in several states including Washington, Oregon, and California. The plant is typically found in disturbed sites such as roadsides and riverbanks. Its introduction is believed to be due to accidental transport through contaminated soil or seeds.</p>
