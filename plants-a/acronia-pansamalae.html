                <h1>Acronia pansamalae</h1>
<p>Acronia pansamalae, commonly known as the Panam√° morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, which includes many species of vines and flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-like, colorful flowers that bloom in the early morning. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia pansamalae has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, covered in a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are pale yellow with four petals, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia pansamalae is primarily native to the island of Pansama in the southern part of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>This rare plant is found exclusively in the coastal regions of Pansama, where it thrives in the unique microclimate created by the interaction of oceanic and mountainous environments. It is adapted to the humid, misty conditions that prevail in the lowland rainforests of the island. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Acronia pansamalae is considered an endemic species of Pansama.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this plant from threats posed by habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia pansamalae was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. This plant was likely introduced through human activity, such as landscaping or accidental transport. It has become a common sight in coastal parks and natural reserves.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant species in these areas.</p>
