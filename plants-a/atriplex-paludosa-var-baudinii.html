                    <h1>Atriplex paludosa var. baudinii</h1>
<p>Atriplex paludosa var. baudinii, commonly known as the marsh saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and wet environments.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in arid or brackish conditions. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in coastal areas, marshes, and saline soils across Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in high-salinity environments makes it an important component of saltland ecosystems.</p>
