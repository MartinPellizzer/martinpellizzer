<p>Audibertiella argentea, commonly known as the silver moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and silvery-gray appearance due to the presence of specialized structures called rhizoids. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on soil or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, with a distinct midrib and a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>Audibertiella argentea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its ecosystem.</p>
