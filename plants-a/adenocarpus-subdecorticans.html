<p>Adenocarpus subdecorticans, commonly known as the African burrbean, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny pods containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system that helps it survive in drought-prone environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
