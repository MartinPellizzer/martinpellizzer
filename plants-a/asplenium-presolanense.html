<p>Asplenium presolanense, commonly known as the Presola fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in moist, shaded forest understories. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spores produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Asplenium presolanense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
