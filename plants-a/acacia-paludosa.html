                    <h1>Acacia paludosa</h1>
<p>Acacia paludosa, commonly known as the swamp acacia, is a shrub native to wetland environments in Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, feathery leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in dense, globular clusters, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or water.</p>
<p>Acacia paludosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
