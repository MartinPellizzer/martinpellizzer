                <h1>Acosta citricolor</h1>
<p>Acosta citricolor, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a strikingly beautiful orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange floral display, which resembles a flame, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are relatively small but numerous, arranged in a loose inflorescence that enhances its visual impact.</p>
<p>Acosta citricolor thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta citricolor has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that exudes a faint citrus scent. It produces small, clustered yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta citricolor is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level. This plant is commonly found in moist, shaded areas within cloud forests and mountainous regions. Its distribution is closely associated with the unique microclimates of the Andes, where it adapts to cooler temperatures and higher humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed outside these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta citricolor was mainly introduced to new habitats in South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It has been observed in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, including roadsides and abandoned agricultural lands. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, further study is needed to assess its ecological impact.</p>
