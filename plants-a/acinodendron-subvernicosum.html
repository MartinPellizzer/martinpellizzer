                <h1>Acinodendron subvernicosum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron subvernicosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in forest understories and is adapted to humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron subvernicosum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that grows upright and branching. Its small, clustered flowers are white with five petals, bloom in the spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron subvernicosum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas within these regions. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in both natural and cultivated environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the Asian continent, with limited occurrences in neighboring regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron subvernicosum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of an ornamental plant collection. The plant has since spread beyond its original introduction sites. It is now found in various habitats across the country.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to native species.</p>
