                    <h1>Asplenium danxiaense</h1>
<p>Asplenium danxiaense, commonly known as the Danxia maidenhair fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a dark green color and a velvety texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or limestone areas. Its spore-bearing structures, called sorocarps, are clustered on the underside of the leaves, a typical feature of the Asplenium genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
