                <h1>Acronychia parviflora</h1>
<p>Acronychia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to northern Australia, particularly Queensland, and is characterized by its small, white flowers and rough, bark-like leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in coastal and inland rainforest areas. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Acronychia parviflora is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional Aboriginal practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia parviflora has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, with a leathery texture and a smooth margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically pale grey to brown, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences, have five petals and stamens, and bloom during the wet season, likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their small size and light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia parviflora is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state. This plant typically grows in rainforests and moist, shaded areas. It is commonly found in the northeastern parts of Queensland.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia parviflora was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of eastern Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and humid climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the subtropical and tropical zones of Queensland and New South Wales. This plant is often associated with coastal forests and sand dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily.</p>
