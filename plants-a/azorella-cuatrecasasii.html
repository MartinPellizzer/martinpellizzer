<p>Azorella cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Andean mat grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs that protect it from intense sunlight and cold.</p>
<p>Azorella cuatrecasasii is well adapted to the extreme conditions of the Andean highlands, where it thrives in rocky soils and low temperatures.</p>
