                    <h1>Alcantarea regina</h1>
<p>Alcantarea regina, commonly known as the Queen's Alcantara, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fleshy, and often spiky leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it store water in its natural habitat. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bats. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens.</p>
