<p>Amauropelta piedrensis var. quisqueyana, commonly known as the Quisqueyan pineapple fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Blechnaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound leaves with a serrated margin. The plant exhibits a rosette growth habit, with short, upright stems that bear the foliage. Its fronds are typically bright green, with a leathery texture, and it produces sporangia in clusters along the leaf margins.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
