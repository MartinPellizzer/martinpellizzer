                    <h1>Ammophila australis</h1>
<p>Ammophila australis, commonly known as the Australian beach grass, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, often stabilizing dunes through its extensive root system. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ammophila australis plays a crucial role in preventing coastal erosion and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
