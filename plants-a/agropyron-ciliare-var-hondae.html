                    <h1>Agropyron ciliare var. hondae</h1>
<p>Agropyron ciliare var. hondae, commonly known as Hondan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense, hardy stands that stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Hondan needlegrass is valued for its ecological role in preventing soil erosion and providing forage for livestock in marginal lands.</p>
