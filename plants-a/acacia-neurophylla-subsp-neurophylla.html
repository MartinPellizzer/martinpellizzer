<p>Acacia neurophylla subsp.</p>
<p>neurophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are highly attractive to native bees and other pollinators. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>The wood of this species is hard and durable, making it valuable for traditional and contemporary uses.</p>
