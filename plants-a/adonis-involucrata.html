                <h1>Adonis involucrata</h1>
<p>Adonis involucrata, commonly known as the Persian buttercup, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or arid environments. The plant features bright yellow flowers with a single pistil and showy petals, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are basal, arranged in a rosette, and are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Adonis involucrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis involucrata has compound, trifoliate leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, branching, and has a smooth, reddish-brown bark. The flowers are showy, with yellow petals and a dark red center, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from poor, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis involucrata is primarily native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean Basin, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, dry, and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This plant is commonly seen in areas such as southern France, Italy, Spain, and the Iberian Peninsula. It prefers sunny exposures and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in isolated populations across its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis involucrata was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been reported in various regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which can be dispersed by wind, water, or animals. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread and minimize its impact on native flora.</p>
