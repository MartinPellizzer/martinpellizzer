                <h1>Acronia chavezii</h1>
<p>Acronia chavezii, commonly known as the Chihuahua acronia, is a flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. It is adapted to arid environments and has a compact, shrub-like growth form.</p>
<p>Acronia chavezii is often found in rocky soils and is relatively rare in the wild.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia chavezii has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia chavezii is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in states like Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with rocky landscapes. It is typically found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Acronia chavezii is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia chavezii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including land development and transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
