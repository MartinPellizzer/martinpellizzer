<p>Agropyron cristatum var. hirsutissimum, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold, arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense,丛生的 foliage, with leaves that are hairy and often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned spikelets. It is adapted to harsh environments, tolerating low temperatures and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
