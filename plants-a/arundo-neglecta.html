                    <h1>Arundo neglecta</h1>
<p>Arundo neglecta, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes during the summer months. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a valuable habitat for wildlife and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
