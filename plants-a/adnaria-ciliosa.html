                <h1>Adnaria ciliosa</h1>
<p>Adnaria ciliosa, commonly known as the hairy sea holly, is a flowering plant species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plumbaginaceae and is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers. The plant features bristly, hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Adnaria ciliosa typically grows in coastal areas and saline soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria ciliosa has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria ciliosa is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in coastal areas of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky shores and sandy beaches where it can anchor itself in the intertidal zone. This plant is commonly found along the coasts of countries such as France, Spain, Italy, and Turkey. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to its ability to tolerate saltwater and fluctuating tidal conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria ciliosa was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as trade and shipping, where it often attaches to vessel hulls or is transported in ballast water.</p>
<p>It has established itself in coastal areas of the Mediterranean and parts of the Atlantic Ocean, thriving in rocky substrates and shallow waters. The plant's ability to spread rapidly has led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems and biodiversity. Due to its invasive nature, monitoring and management efforts are being implemented in affected regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the challenges of managing non-native species in marine environments.</p>
