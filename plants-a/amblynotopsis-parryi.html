                    <h1>Amblynotopsis parryi</h1>
<p>Amblynotopsis parryi, commonly known as the Parry's amblynotopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts.</p>
