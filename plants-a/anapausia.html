                    <h1>Anapausia</h1>
<p>Anapausia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant belonging to the Aizoaceae family, native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, lantern-like inflorescence that appears only after the plant has been damaged or stressed. The plant's flowers are typically pale pink or white, with a delicate, almost ethereal appearance. Anapausia thrives in arid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a fascinating subject for both horticultural and ecological study.</p>
