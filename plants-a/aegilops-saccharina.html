                <h1>Aegilops saccharina</h1>
<p>Aegilops saccharina, commonly known as the barley grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both sterile and fertile florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or cultivated areas.</p>
<p>Aegilops saccharina is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops saccharina has leaves that are narrow, grass-like in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green to brown color, growing upright and branching at the base. The flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to white florets, blooming in early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-angled caryopsis, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>
