                <h1>Acacia drewiana subsp. minor</h1>
<p>Acacia drewiana subsp.</p>
<p>minor, commonly known as the small-flowered acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale yellow flowers arranged in compact globular inflorescences.</p>
<p>The leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous tiny, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia drewiana subsp.</p>
<p>minor has small, narrow, pinnate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, typically measuring up to 5 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface. The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a shrub-like growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow and arranged in compact, globular inflorescences, blooming during the warmer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a flat, pod-like legume containing small, elongated seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia drewiana subsp.</p>
<p>minor is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola. Its current distribution includes parts of southern Africa, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is commonly found in savannas and shrublands, often near rocky outcrops or along dry riverbeds. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is listed as vulnerable in some areas, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia drewiana subsp.</p>
<p>minor is a small, attractive shrub native to South Africa, known for its delicate, feathery foliage and yellow flowers. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the desired characteristics. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, thriving in mild climates and requiring minimal care once established.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring and pruning to shape the plant and promote flowering are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with succulents or other drought-tolerant species can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve garden biodiversity.</p>
