                <h1>Adonis dahurica</h1>
<p>Adonis dahurica, commonly known as the Caucasian glory-of-the-snow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers with prominent central spurs. The plant is part of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes buttercups and larkspurs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Adonis dahurica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis dahurica has alternate, narrow, elongated leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a greenish color, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are yellow, with a distinctive central green spot, and are arranged in umbels; they bloom in early summer and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are taproots that are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself and access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis dahurica is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Russia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia.</p>
<p>It is also found in the northern areas of China, particularly in the provinces of Xinjiang and Heilongjiang. This plant thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters. It is commonly found in the Tianshan and Altai mountain ranges, where the climate is cold and dry.</p>
<p>Adonis dahurica is known for its showy yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis dahurica was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils. The plant has spread across several countries in Europe and parts of Asia due to its adaptability and reproductive capabilities. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in areas where it establishes itself aggressively.</p>
