                <h1>Aegopodium decumbens</h1>
<p>Aegopodium decumbens, commonly known as creeping ground-ivy, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like carrots and parsley.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegopodium decumbens has leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 1 to 3 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is prostrate, hairy, and has a light green to brownish color, with a slightly rough texture. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in umbels, and bloom from late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the seeds are minute and numerous.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's spreading growth habit.</p>
