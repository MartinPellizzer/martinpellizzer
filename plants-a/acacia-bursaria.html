                        <h1>Acacia bursaria</h1>
<p>Acacia bursaria, commonly known as the burr acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and compound leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of whitish, powdery bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, followed by distinctive burr-like seed pods that persist into winter. Acacia bursaria is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia bursaria is primarily native to Australia, specifically the southern and western regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas such as Western Australia, South Australia, and parts of New South Wales. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy soils. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands.</p>
<p>Acacia bursaria plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia bursaria was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and provide shade in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, quarries, and agricultural fields. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it suitable for rehabilitation projects. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it a valuable species for land restoration.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
