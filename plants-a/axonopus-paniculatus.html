                <h1>Axonopus paniculatus</h1>
<p>Axonopus paniculatus, commonly known as the flat sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
