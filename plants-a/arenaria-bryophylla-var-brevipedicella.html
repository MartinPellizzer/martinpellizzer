                    <h1>Arenaria bryophylla var. brevipedicella</h1>
<p>Arenaria bryophylla var. brevipedicella, commonly known as the short-stemmed sand sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and erosion control.</p>
<p>The variety brevipedicella is distinguished by its shorter pedicels compared to other varieties of Arenaria bryophylla.</p>
