                    <h1>Arceuthobium campylopodum subsp. abietinum</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium campylopodum subsp.</p>
<p>abietinum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests coniferous trees such as firs and spruces. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, forming dense clusters on the branches.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds, aiding in its spread. Its life cycle involves a complex interaction with its host, including the germination of seeds through a process called autochory.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
