                    <h1>Anachaste</h1>
<p>Anachaste, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Anachaste is now considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
