                <h1>Adinandra schliebenii</h1>
<p>Adinandra schliebenii, commonly known as the Schlieben's adinandra, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round berries. It is often found in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental foliage.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra schliebenii has simple, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a shrub-like habit. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra schliebenii is primarily native to tropical regions of Africa, specifically found in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland rainforest environments. This species is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas with suitable climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra schliebenii was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high rainfall and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests. This plant has been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia, where it has established populations in natural and disturbed habitats. It is commonly used for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
