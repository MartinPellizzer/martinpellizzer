<p>Atheropogon stolonifer, commonly known as the creeping grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively through stolons and rhizomes. The plant typically forms dense mats, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Atheropogon stolonifer is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban areas.</p>
