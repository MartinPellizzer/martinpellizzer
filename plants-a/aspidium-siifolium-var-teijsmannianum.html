                    <h1>Aspidium siifolium var. teijsmannianum</h1>
<p>Aspidium siifolium var. teijsmannianum, commonly known as the Teijsmann's water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its spores are produced in spherical, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its adaptability to aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
