                <h1>Acer intermedium f. fukarekii</h1>
<p>Acer intermedium f. fukarekii, commonly known as the Fukarekii maple, is a variant of the intermediate maple characterized by its distinctive foliage and growth habits.</p>
<p>This form exhibits unique leaf morphology, often displaying a more elongated and serrated leaf shape compared to the typical species. It thrives in temperate climates, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal, with vibrant fall coloration that ranges from yellow to red.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for smaller gardens and urban landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer intermedium f. fukarekii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“8 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming in early spring, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer intermedium f. fukarekii is a rare variant of the intermediate maple, native to the mountainous regions of southern Japan, specifically the island of Shikoku.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited to this area, it is now also found in parts of Korea and China due to horticultural introduction. This plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, typically found in forest understories. It grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,000 meters, where temperatures are moderate and precipitation is abundant.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population, it is considered a conservation concern and is often protected in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer intermedium f. fukarekii is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings in late summer or through seed sown in early spring. This deciduous shrub or small tree has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires consistent watering during dry periods. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and promote air circulation. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a shaded garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer intermedium f. fukarekii is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in mixed vegetation, enhancing biodiversity in forest edges. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a variety of life forms in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer intermedium f. fukarekii is a lesser-known maple species primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes and urban greening projects.</p>
<p>While not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and sap may have limited local use in traditional practices. In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for its potential antioxidant properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to the forestry sector by providing timber for small-scale crafts and construction.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer intermedium f. fukarekii has a limited number of recognized cultivars, with 'Aureum' and 'Variegatum' being among the most popular for their striking foliage colors.</p>
<p>This form is often used as a parent in hybridization efforts, leading to the development of various hybrids that exhibit enhanced ornamental traits. Hybrid varieties often combine the hardiness of Acer intermedium with the vibrant leaf colors of other maples, making them highly sought after in horticulture. These hybrids are valued for their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer intermedium f. fukarekii plays a significant role in the cultivation of ornamental maples due to its genetic potential and horticultural versatility.</p>
