                <h1>Acrosanthes decandra</h1>
<p>Acrosanthes decandra, commonly known as the slender candlewood, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, candle-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in elongated spikes. Acrosanthes decandra is typically found in open forests and heathlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it a notable species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrosanthes decandra has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and measure approximately 10-15 cm in length, with a dark green color and a smooth upper surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are large, showy, and have a distinctive structure with a tubular corolla and five lobes, displaying a pale yellow to orange color, and they bloom during the summer months, primarily pollinated by birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils in which the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosanthes decandra is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>It is found in the fynbos vegetation of this region. The plant thrives in the unique Mediterranean climate of the area. It is commonly found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the Cape Provinces.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosanthes decandra was mainly introduced to areas with a warm, humid climate and well-drained soils, typically in coastal or lowland regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high rainfall and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. This plant is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. It has also been introduced to several tropical and subtropical regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally limited by its specific climatic requirements and soil preferences.</p>
