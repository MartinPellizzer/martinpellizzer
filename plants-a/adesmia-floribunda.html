                <h1>Adesmia floribunda</h1>
<p>Adesmia floribunda, commonly known as the clustered legume, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes and beans, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, arid environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, rounded pods that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Adesmia floribunda is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature and ecological resilience.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia floribunda has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are oval to lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia floribunda is primarily native to South America, specifically Argentina and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the dry grasslands and semi-arid regions of these countries. This plant thrives in regions with low rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often associated with shrublands and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia floribunda was mainly introduced to areas with Mediterranean climates, characterized by mild, wet winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for coastal and inland regions. This plant is commonly found in California, Oregon, and parts of Chile, where it has been intentionally cultivated for ornamental purposes. It has also been introduced to other regions with similar climatic conditions, such as parts of South Africa and Australia.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has sometimes become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
