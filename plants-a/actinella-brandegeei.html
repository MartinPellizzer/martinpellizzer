                <h1>Actinella brandegeei</h1>
<p>Actinella brandegeei, commonly known as the Brandegee's actinella, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open woodlands. It produces small, yellow to brown flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a rough texture adapted to conserve water.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella brandegeei has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella brandegeei is primarily native to the Pacific Northwest region of North America, including parts of Washington and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This plant thrives in areas with rich, organic soil and consistent moisture. It is often associated with coniferous and mixed evergreen forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella brandegeei was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>It is typically spread through seed dispersal by wind, animals, or human activity. The plant thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full to partial sunlight. It has been reported in several states across the United States, particularly in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in disturbed habitats and along roadsides.</p>
