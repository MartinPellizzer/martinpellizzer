                <h1>Achillea pectinata</h1>
<p>Achillea pectinata, commonly known as the fuzzy yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and flat, pinkish-white flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and wildflower meadows.</p>
<p>Its historical use in herbal medicine is attributed to its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pectinata has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pectinata is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands, woodland edges, and slopes. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often associated with dry, sunny environments and is known for its delicate, feathery foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can also be found in some regions of the Middle East and the Canary Islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pectinata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in some areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
