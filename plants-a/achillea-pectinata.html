                <h1>Achillea pectinata</h1>
<p>Achillea pectinata, commonly known as the fuzzy yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers.</p>
<p>Achillea pectinata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pectinata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a gray-green color due to a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are compound, consisting of a central yellow disk surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pectinata is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Spain, Italy, and Morocco, where it thrives in rocky and calcareous soils. This species typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as slopes and coastal areas. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea pectinata is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea pectinata is a hardy perennial known for its showy yellow flowers and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a summer-growing cycle, blooming from late spring to early fall, with a dormant period in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding wet feet to prevent root rot. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea pectinata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, which rely on its flowers and seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Achillea pectinata also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health through organic matter accumulation.</p>
