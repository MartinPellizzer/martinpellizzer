                        <h1>Acer yui</h1>
<p>Acer yui, commonly known as the Yui maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elegant, slender form and delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, Acer yui is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in horticultural settings.</p>
