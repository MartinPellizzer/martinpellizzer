<p>Achimenes kewensis, commonly known as the Kew achimenes, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces showy bracts that often resemble the flowers, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant.</p>
<p>Achimenes kewensis is known for its rapid growth and ability to bloom throughout the growing season.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes kewensis has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring around 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and green, with a trailing growth pattern that often produces aerial roots.
