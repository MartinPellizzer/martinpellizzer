                    <h1>Andropogon sorghum</h1>
<p>Andropogon sorghum, commonly known as sorghum, is a tall, warm-season grass native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust stalks and spike-like inflorescence, which consists of dense clusters of small, two-lipped flowers. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient crop for cultivation in various regions. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a rough texture, and it produces both male and female inflorescences for wind pollination.</p>
<p>Sorghum is widely used for forage, grain, and biofuel production due to its high yield and drought tolerance.</p>
