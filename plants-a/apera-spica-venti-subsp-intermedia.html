<p>Apera spica-venti subsp.</p>
<p>intermedia, commonly known as windgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological studies and a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
