<p>Armeriastrum subulatum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its narrow, needle-like leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, and the plant is drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
