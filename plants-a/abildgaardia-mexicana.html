Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a distinctive morphology, including horsetails and their relatives. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species, known for their diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Poales, a large group of flowering plants that includes grasses, sedges, and related families, characterized by their wind-pollinated flowers. Its family is Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, which includes plants typically found in wet environments and characterized by their triangular stems. Its genus is Abildgaardia, a small genus within the Cyperaceae family, consisting of a few species that are often found in specific geographic regions.</p>
<p>Its species is Abildgaardia mexicana, a specific plant within the genus Abildgaardia, native to Mexico, and known for its unique ecological and morphological traits.</p>
