                    <h1>Asplenium purdieanum</h1>
<p>Asplenium purdieanum, commonly known as the Puddester's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated margin. This species is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant's rhizome is short and often covered with a dense mat of roots, which helps it anchor to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>Asplenium purdieanum is often found in forest understories, where it contributes to the biodiversity of epiphytic and lithophytic ecosystems.</p>
