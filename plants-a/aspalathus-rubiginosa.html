<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is well adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. Its most notable feature is the reddish-brown tea that is produced from its leaves, which is rich in antioxidants and has a unique flavor.</p>
<p>Aspalathus rubiginosa is also known for its medicinal properties and is widely cultivated for commercial purposes.</p>
