                    <h1>Amorphophallus atroviridis</h1>
<p>Amorphophallus atroviridis, commonly known as the black-veined arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with a spadix and a spathe, typical of many aroid species. Its tuberous root system is used for starch production, making it economically valuable in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, it is also noted for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released when the spadix matures.</p>
