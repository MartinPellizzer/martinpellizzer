                <h1>Adiantum triangulatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum triangulatum, commonly known as the fan-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fan-shaped fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and thrives in humid conditions. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a delicate, almost translucent quality.</p>
<p>Adiantum triangulatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in the right conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum triangulatum has fern-like leaves that are triangular in shape, with a delicate, finely divided structure, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright green, with a slender, upright growth pattern and can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant has a slender, branched stem that is smooth and light green in color, growing from a rhizome.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, appearing in late spring to early summer. The fruit is a dry, winged capsule that releases tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum triangulatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments. This fern thrives in forest understories and near streams or waterfalls. Its distribution also extends to the Philippines and parts of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a popular ornamental plant due to its delicate, lace-like fronds.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum triangulatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. This fern is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate, triangular fronds. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these areas and can sometimes spread beyond cultivated gardens.</p>
