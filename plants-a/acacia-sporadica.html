                    <h1>Acacia sporadica</h1>
<p>Acacia sporadica, commonly known as the scattered acacia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Acacia sporadica is well-suited to harsh environments due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
