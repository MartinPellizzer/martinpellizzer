                <h1>Adicea portoricensis</h1>
<p>Adicea portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican adicea, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea portoricensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a moderate size, and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a pale greenish-brown color, exhibiting a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that contains small seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea portoricensis is primarily native to the Caribbean region, specifically Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is found in the moist tropical forests and coastal areas of the island. This plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil. It is commonly seen in shaded understory habitats within the Caribbean's diverse ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species to Puerto Rico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea portoricensis was mainly introduced to Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along the shores. It has become a common species in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native flora.</p>
