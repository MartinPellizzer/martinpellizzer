                <h1>Achnatherum constrictum</h1>
<p>Achnatherum constrictum, commonly known as western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions, including arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Achnatherum constrictum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum constrictum has narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in length from 10 to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to bluish color, and it grows upright with a clumping growth pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing greenish to brownish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and they are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-angled achene that is dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum constrictum is primarily native to North America, particularly the western United States and southern Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in association with other drought-tolerant species. Its distribution extends from Montana and Idaho to California and Nevada, with some populations also occurring in the Great Basin region.</p>
<p>Achnatherum constrictum is an important component of native grassland ecosystems in these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum constrictum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along trails.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in states like California, Nevada, and Utah. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often associated with sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its introduction has been documented in various ecological studies due to its ability to colonize disturbed sites rapidly.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a non-invasive species that plays a minor role in local plant communities.</p>
