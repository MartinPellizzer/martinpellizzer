                    <h1>Adelia spinosa var. hirsuta</h1>
<p>Adelia spinosa var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy adelia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branching stem covered in short, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
