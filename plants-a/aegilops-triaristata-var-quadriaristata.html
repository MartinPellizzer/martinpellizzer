                    <h1>Aegilops triaristata var. quadriaristata</h1>
<p>Aegilops triaristata var. quadriaristata, commonly known as the four-awned wild oat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like flowers with four awns, which are bristle-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic relationship to cultivated wheat and its potential role in crop improvement.</p>
