                    <h1>Actinidia liangguangensis var. rubriflora</h1>
<p>Actinidia liangguangensis var. rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered Liangguang actinidia, is a rare variant of the actinidia genus native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a distinctive visual appeal to its natural habitat. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with compound leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its fruit, like other actinidias, is edible and has a flavor similar to kiwifruit, though it is less commonly cultivated.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
