                    <h1>Artemisia szowitziana</h1>
<p>Artemisia szowitziana, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The aromatic compounds in its leaves have historically been used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent.</p>
