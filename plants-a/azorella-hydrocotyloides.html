                    <h1>Azorella hydrocotyloides</h1>
<p>Azorella hydrocotyloides, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a unique member of theApiaceae family native to the Andes mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that form a compact cushion shape. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cold, arid conditions with strong sunlight. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense UV radiation.</p>
<p>Azorella hydrocotyloides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other alpine flora.</p>
