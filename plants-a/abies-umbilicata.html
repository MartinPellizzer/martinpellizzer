                        <h1>Abies umbilicata</h1>
<p>Abies umbilicata, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pyramidal shape, needle-like leaves that are typically light green, and its distinctive cones that hang downward. The tree thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones.</p>
<p>Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it produces a fragrant resin that is used in various traditional and commercial applications.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies umbilicata is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate forest ecosystems at high elevations. This species thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with coniferous forests and is adapted to rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends across several mountain ranges in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies umbilicata was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental tree due to its unique appearance and cold hardiness.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas across the northeastern and northwestern United States. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. Its introduction has led to some ecological concerns due to its potential to spread beyond cultivated areas.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is important to manage its distribution to prevent invasion of native ecosystems.</p>
