                    <h1>Alchemilla fissa var. fallax</h1>
<p>Alchemilla fissa var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax ladyâ€™s mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, upright inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture and contributing to their water-retentive properties.</p>
