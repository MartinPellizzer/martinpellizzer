<p>Androsace pubescens subsp.</p>
<p>hirtella, commonly known as the hairy androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, hairy foliage that helps retain moisture and insulate against cold temperatures.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to rocky and nutrient-poor soils, making it a common sight in mountainous environments.</p>
