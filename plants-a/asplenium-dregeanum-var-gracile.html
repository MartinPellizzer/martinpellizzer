<p>Asplenium dregeanum var. gracile, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length, with a finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded garden beds or as a houseplant.</p>
