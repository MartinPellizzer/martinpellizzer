                <h1>Acer × osmastonii</h1>
<p>Acer × osmastonii, commonly known as the Osmon's maple, is a hybrid deciduous tree that results from the cross between Acer rubrum (red maple) and Acer negundo (box elder).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically 5-7 lobes and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant is native to the United States and is often found in moist, wooded areas. It produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × osmastonii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, reaching up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and reddish-brown, with a moderate growth rate and a tendency to branch freely. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in cymes during early spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, providing stability and efficient nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × osmastonii is a hybrid maple species native to the mountainous regions of China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and primarily confined to its native range due to its rarity. This species thrives in temperate climates, often growing in mixed forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. It is considered a critically endangered plant, facing threats from habitat loss and limited natural propagation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique hybrid maple.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × osmastonii is a hybrid maple known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with cuttings offering a more reliable method for maintaining desired traits. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 10 to 15 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning should be done in late winter to shape the tree and remove any dead or diseased branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like lavender or roses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer × osmastonii is a hybrid maple tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed-species forests, enhancing overall ecosystem stability. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in land restoration projects.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving soil quality and supporting a diverse range of plant and animal life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer × osmastonii is a hybrid maple tree known for its ornamental value and is commonly used in horticulture for landscaping and garden decoration.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its vibrant autumn foliage makes it a popular choice for enhancing the visual appeal of parks and public spaces.
