<p>Asarca reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed asarum, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, spiral-shaped flowers. The plant produces a fragrant, waxy bloom that attracts insects, particularly flies, which are its primary pollinators. Asarca reflexa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive species in many regions.</p>
