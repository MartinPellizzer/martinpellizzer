<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
