                <h1>Acrorumohra undulata</h1>
<p>Acrorumohra undulata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf fern, is a unique species characterized by its delicate, undulating fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features compound leaves with a distinctive wavy margin, which contributes to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are borne on spore-bearing spikes, typical of its fern classification.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrorumohra undulata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, covered in a smooth, reddish-brown bark, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pale pink to white, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system consists of fibrous roots that anchor the plant and aid in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrorumohra undulata is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forests where it receives ample sunlight and moisture. This plant is commonly found in the understory of primary and secondary rainforests. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with other shade-tolerant flora.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrorumohra undulata was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions where it has established itself in disturbed habitats. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have contributed to its spread in these areas. It is often found in coastal zones and urban landscapes.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
