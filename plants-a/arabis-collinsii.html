<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Arabis collinsii is often found in open, sunny habitats and is a common sight in alpine meadows and rocky outcrops.</p>
