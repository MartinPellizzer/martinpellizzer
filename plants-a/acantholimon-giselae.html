                        <h1>Acantholimon giselae</h1>
<p>Acantholimon giselae, commonly known as the Giselae's thornscale, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, often silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon giselae is primarily native to the western United States, specifically the state of California.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal ranges and the Transverse Ranges, particularly in areas with rocky soils and coastal climates. This plant thrives in Mediterranean-type climates characterized by mild, wet winters and dry summers. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky outcrops, and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon giselae was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with low moisture and high sunlight exposure. This plant is typically found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It has been reported in several countries across the Mediterranean basin, including Spain, France, and parts of Italy.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native flora.</p>
