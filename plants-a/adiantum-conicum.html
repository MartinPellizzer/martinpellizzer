                <h1>Adiantum conicum</h1>
<p>Adiantum conicum, commonly known as the button fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive, rounded fronds that resemble buttons. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to retain moisture in its fronds makes it well adapted to humid climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum conicum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, typically arranged in a bipinnate pattern along the stems.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green, with a slender, upright growth habit and can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is usually unbranched, with a smooth, dark brown bark. Adiantum conicum does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-bearing plant, and its reproductive structures are in the form of spore-producing sporangia located on the undersides of the leaves.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, helping to anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum conicum is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This fern thrives in areas with rich, well-drained soil and high humidity. Its distribution spans from the southeastern United States up through the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It is often seen growing in rocky crevices and along the edges of forests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum conicum was mainly introduced to specific regions with moist, shaded environments, often as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses where its delicate fronds and compact growth make it a desirable addition. The plant prefers well-drained soil and moderate temperatures, which are typically maintained in cultivated settings. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and intentional cultivation by enthusiasts.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is grown.</p>
