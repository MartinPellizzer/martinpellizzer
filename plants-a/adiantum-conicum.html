                    <h1>Adiantum conicum</h1>
<p>Adiantum conicum, commonly known as the button fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive, rounded fronds that resemble buttons. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to retain moisture in its fronds makes it well adapted to humid climates.</p>
