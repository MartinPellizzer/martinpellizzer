                <h1>Adiantum mexicanum</h1>
<p>Adiantum mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that resemble a feather. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a glossy appearance, with a unique ability to curl up when dry.</p>
<p>Adiantum mexicanum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum mexicanum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, finely toothed margin, and are typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green, slightly glossy, and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green to brownish bark that grows upright. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically greenish-yellow in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a spore-bearing capsule that disperses spores through wind, and the roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum mexicanum is primarily native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky streambanks. This fern thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in mountainous areas. Its distribution includes parts of southern Mexico, including the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas.</p>
<p>It is also present in countries like Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum mexicanum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in locations with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens and rockeries. This plant is commonly cultivated as an ornamental species due to its delicate, fern-like fronds. Its introduction has been documented in various parts of North America, particularly in the eastern and western United States.</p>
<p>However, it is considered non-invasive and does not typically spread aggressively in natural habitats.</p>
