                    <h1>Acacia falcata</h1>
<p>Acacia falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are narrow and often drooping. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Acacia falcata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for honeyeaters and other native pollinators.</p>
