                <h1>Adesmia retrofracta</h1>
<p>Adesmia retrofracta, commonly known as the yellow bignay, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are usually simple and alternate. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>The fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, which are often used in local cuisines.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia retrofracta has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows in a creeping or ascending manner. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, with five petals and stamens, blooming in spring, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia retrofracta is primarily native to Argentina Northwest and Argentina South.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these areas. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The species is adapted to the harsh climate conditions of the region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these parts of Argentina.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia retrofracta was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with low rainfall and poor soil conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural fields and along roadsides. The plant spreads through seeds that are dispersed by wind, water, and animals, contributing to its rapid colonization of new areas. Its introduction has led to competition with native plant species, affecting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread are ongoing, particularly in regions where it threatens native ecosystems.</p>
