                    <h1>Andropogon sorghum var. halepensis</h1>
<p>Andropogon sorghum var. halepensis, commonly known as tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, often spiny foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale pink. The plant is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a common species in coastal and inland areas with poor soil. Its roots can fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility, and it is often used for erosion control.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in non-native regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
