                <h1>Adhatoda dipteracantha</h1>
<p>Adhatoda dipteracantha, commonly known as the blue-flowered adhatoda, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and clusters of small, blue or violet flowers. The plant belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically visited by various pollinators, including bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant is also noted for its medicinal properties, used traditionally in herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda dipteracantha has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grey to brown in color. The flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring tubular corollas with five lobes, and are typically blue or violet in color, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda dipteracantha is primarily native to India, particularly in the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southern Nepal and northern Sri Lanka. This plant typically grows in moist, tropical regions and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. It is commonly known as the "Indian Trumpet" due to its distinctive flowering pattern.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to the humid and warm climate of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda dipteracantha was mainly introduced to control erosion and for ornamental purposes in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in areas such as India, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa. The plant has become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to manage its spread in areas where it is considered a weed.</p>
