                <h1>Achillea serratifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, hairy stems and narrow, serrated leaves that are typically gray-green in color. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are usually pale yellow to white and are arranged in flat-topped clusters.</p>
<p>Achillea serratifolia is often found in dry grasslands, woodland edges, and rocky soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea serratifolia has leaves that are serrated, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming in early summer and attracting insects for pollination. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>
