                <h1>Adenopus guineensis</h1>
<p>Adenopus guineensis, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is a key feature of the genus Adenopus. The plant typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters and has simple, alternate leaves that are often glandular-dotted. Its flowers are small and clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, a common trait in the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in traditional medicine and has potential applications in pharmacology.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopus guineensis has leaves that are alternate, simple, and ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with yellow petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in poor soils and access moisture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopus guineensis is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and abundant rainfall. This plant is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Adenopus guineensis is often used in traditional medicine for its medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopus guineensis was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions due to its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It has been observed in various countries in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems. Its spread is often facilitated by human activity, such as landscaping and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>Monitoring its distribution is essential to assess its ecological impact and manage its spread effectively.</p>
