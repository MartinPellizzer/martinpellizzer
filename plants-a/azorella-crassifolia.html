<p>Azorella crassifolia, commonly known as the Andean moss cushion, is a unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form composed of tightly packed, wiry stems and leaves. The plant is adapted to extreme environmental conditions, including cold temperatures, strong winds, and intense sunlight. Its leaves are typically thick and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Azorella crassifolia is also known for its ability to survive in poor soil and is often found in alpine and subantarctic environments.</p>
