                <h1>Acrocarpus polyphyllus</h1>
<p>Acrocarpus polyphyllus, commonly known as the broad-leaved ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive, broad, leathery leaves. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing edible seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in construction and furniture.</p>
<p>Acrocarpus polyphyllus plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus polyphyllus has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green color on the upper surface, and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement and range in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length. The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a rough, fibrous bark that is typically dark brown or reddish-brown in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and feathery appendages.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus polyphyllus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest regions, particularly in areas with humid tropical climates. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often part of the undergrowth in secondary forests. It is also occasionally found in parts of northeastern India and the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it can adapt to a variety of forested environments within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus polyphyllus was mainly introduced to areas with suitable tropical and subtropical climates for its ornamental value and potential use in reforestation.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a range of environmental conditions. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
