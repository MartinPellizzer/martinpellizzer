<p>Alopecurus pratensis var. ventricosus, commonly known as the bulblet fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and wetlands.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to form bulb-like structures at the base, which contribute to its vegetative propagation.</p>
