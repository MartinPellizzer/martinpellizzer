                <h1>Achillea halleri</h1>
<p>Achillea halleri, commonly known as lesser yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, and its leaves are typically gray-green with a woolly texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Achillea halleri is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea halleri has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a grayish-blue color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green color, growing from the base of the plant. Its flowers are small, composite structures with yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea halleri is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across parts of Europe and Asia, with populations also found in the Carpathian Mountains and the Alps. This species thrives in rocky, alpine environments, often growing on slopes and in meadows. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Achillea halleri is considered to be of conservation concern due to habitat loss and overgrazing, though its exact status may vary by region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea halleri is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate yellow flowers and fragrant foliage, commonly grown in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing established clumps, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining the plant's genetic traits. The growth cycle of Achillea halleri involves a dormant period in winter, followed by rapid growth and flowering in early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in spring, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its fragrance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea halleri is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering both nectar and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Achillea halleri also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving the overall health of its surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea halleri is a flowering plant known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat wounds and inflammation due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial compounds.</p>
