                    <h1>Andropogon inundatus</h1>
<p>Andropogon inundatus, commonly known as water grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in saturated soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Andropogon inundatus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
