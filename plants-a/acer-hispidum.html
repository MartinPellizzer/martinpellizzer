                <h1>Acer hispidum</h1>
<p>Acer hispidum, commonly known as the hairy maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>The hairy maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to adapt to a variety of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer hispidum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length; they are dark green on top and lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in panicles, with yellowish-green petals, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind; the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer hispidum is a species of maple native to eastern North America, primarily found in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Appalachian Mountains and the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This plant typically grows in forested areas, often as an understory tree or shrub, preferring partial to full shade. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Acer hispidum is listed as a species of concern in some regions due to habitat loss and fragmentation, though it is not currently classified as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer hispidum is a deciduous tree known for its attractive, spiny leaves and adaptability to various conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer hispidum includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead branches are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sage can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer hispidum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local ecosystems. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil health. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer hispidum contributes to carbon sequestration, offering long-term ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer hispidum is a species of maple native to North America, known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various environments.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential nutritional benefits. In traditional medicine, it has been used by Indigenous communities for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Industrially, it contributes to the forestry sector, providing timber for construction and furniture.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and adaptability, often featured in local landscapes and ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer hispidum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Summer Snowflake' and 'Crimson King', which are known for their striking foliage colors. The species is also used in horticultural breeding to create hybrids that enhance leaf color and growth habits. These hybrids often exhibit improved hardiness and adaptability to different climates.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal, Acer hispidum plays a significant role in landscape design and garden plantings.</p>
