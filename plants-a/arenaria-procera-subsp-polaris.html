<p>Arenaria procera subsp.</p>
<p>polaris, commonly known as the polar sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in harsh environments, including tundra and rocky soils, where it forms dense mats to conserve heat and moisture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly taller growth form compared to other Arenaria species, making it well-suited for its extreme habitat.</p>
