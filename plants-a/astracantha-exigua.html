<p>Astracantha exigua, commonly known as the narrowleaf burweed, is a small, annual herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, where it thrives in full sun. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of small, spiny fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Its botanical features include a hairy stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a distinctive, cylindrical fruit structure.</p>
<p>Astracantha exigua is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
