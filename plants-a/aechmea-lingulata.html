                    <h1>Aechmea lingulata</h1>
<p>Aechmea lingulata, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and provides a habitat for small organisms. The leaves are typically dark green with a velvety texture and often have a bluish or purplish hue. It produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding dramatic visual contrast.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
