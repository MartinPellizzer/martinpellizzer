                <h1>Adenocalymma heterophyllum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found in shaded areas within forests.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough texture that aids in water retention.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma heterophyllum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2â€“4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma heterophyllum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically occurring in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This plant is often associated with shrublands and grasslands, thriving in environments with low rainfall. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, displaying drought resistance and efficient water use.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the southwestern and central parts of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma heterophyllum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in coastal dunes, roadsides, and degraded grasslands. Its introduction has led to its spread across several coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in disturbed environments.</p>
