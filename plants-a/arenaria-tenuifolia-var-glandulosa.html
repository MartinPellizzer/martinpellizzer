<p>Arenaria tenuifolia var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
