<p>It thrives in dry to moist environments, often found in savannas, woodlands, and along riverbanks. The plant is commonly seen in open habitats with well-drained soils, and it can sometimes be found in disturbed areas. It is well adapted to the warm climate and seasonal rainfall patterns of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in other regions with similar environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha angolensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in countries like Australia, the United States, and parts of Southeast Asia.
