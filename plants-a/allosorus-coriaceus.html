<p>Allosorus coriaceus, commonly known as the thick-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery thallus that is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a symbiotic association between algae and fungi. It is often found growing on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Allosorus coriaceus plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
