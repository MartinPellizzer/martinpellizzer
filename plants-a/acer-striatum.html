                <h1>Acer striatum</h1>
<p>Acer striatum, commonly known as the striped maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated leaves that often display a pale green stripe along the midrib. The tree typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 meters, with a slender, often twisted trunk. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces samaras with two winged seeds.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer striatum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a finely serrated margin and a doubly serrated base, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes whitish underside. The stem is slender and smooth, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, arranged in cymes, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer striatum is a species of maple native to eastern China, specifically found in the provinces of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these regions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, Acer striatum is considered a rare and endangered plant, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer striatum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant, striped leaves and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seedlings requiring patience due to their slow germination. The growth cycle of Acer striatum includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. While generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally face issues like aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants or shrubs can enhance its growth and overall garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer striatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a complex web of life. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>
