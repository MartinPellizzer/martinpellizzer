                <h1>Acmadenia pungens</h1>
<p>Acmadenia pungens, commonly known as the prickly acacia, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are characteristic of the Rutaceae family. Its leaves are simple and opposite, often with a slight pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant is noted for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmadenia pungens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a sprawling or shrub-like growth pattern. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, with five petals, and are borne in clusters during the spring; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia pungens is primarily native to eastern Australia, including parts of New South Wales, Queensland, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and woodland areas. This plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or sandy substrates. It is adapted to the temperate to subtropical climates of these regions.</p>
<p>Acmadenia pungens is a shrub that plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia pungens was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Australia, as part of ecological restoration efforts.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal heathlands and sand dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife. The plant is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for coastal environments. Its introduction has helped in the rehabilitation of degraded areas along the NSW coastline.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential impacts on native vegetation.</p>
