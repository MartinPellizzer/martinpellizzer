<p>Acacia canescens var. albida, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, pale green stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous tiny, linear leaflets that help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
