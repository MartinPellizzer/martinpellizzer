<p>Asplenium fernandezianum, commonly known as the Fernandez's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in dense clusters on rocky or shaded surfaces. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in humid, temperate climates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium fernandezianum is a relatively rare species, often restricted to specific microhabitats in its native range.</p>
