<p>Aspidium muenchii, commonly known as the Muench's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that features a central stalk and multiple divisions. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Aspidium muenchii prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
