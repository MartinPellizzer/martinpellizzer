                <h1>Acinos heterophyllus</h1>
<p>Acinos heterophyllus, commonly known as the Alpine Everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are usually gray-green and hairy, adapting to cold and arid conditions.</p>
<p>The showy yellow flowers appear in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos heterophyllus has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and vary in size from 1 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, hairy, and typically reddish-brown in color, with a growth pattern that is generally upright and branching. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and have a simple structure with five petals; they bloom in early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos heterophyllus is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas with a Mediterranean climate. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with open woodlands and grasslands. It is also present in parts of Nevada and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>Acinos heterophyllus is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is an important part of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos heterophyllus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in areas where it is not native.</p>
