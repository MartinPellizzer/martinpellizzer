<p>Anemonastrum patulum, commonly known as the broadleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Anemonastrum patulum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
