<p>Argylia eremophila, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, hard seeds.</p>
<p>Argylia eremophila plays an important ecological role by providing nectar to pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
