<p>Argentina lignosa, commonly known as the Argentine lignous plant, is a woody shrub native to the grasslands of Argentina.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system that allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The plant's lignified stems provide structural support and contribute to its resilience in harsh conditions.</p>
