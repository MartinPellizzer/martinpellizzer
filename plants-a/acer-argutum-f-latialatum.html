                <h1>Acer argutum f. latialatum</h1>
<p>Acer argutum f. latialatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maple, is a variant of the Japanese maple characterized by its wide, lobed leaves.</p>
<p>This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Japan and is valued for its ornamental qualities. The leaves are typically bright green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for garden cultivation.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer argutum f. latialatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, typically 5-10 cm in length, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a paired samara with winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer argutum f. latialatum is a rare variant of the Japanese maple known for its distinctive leaf shape.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Japan, it originally thrived in temperate forest ecosystems. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in its native range, with some specimens cultivated in botanical gardens. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters, preferring cool, moist climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited natural population, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer argutum f. latialatum is a compact, ornamental maple known for its vibrant fall foliage and unique leaf shape.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-hardwood cuttings in late summer or by seed collected in the fall, though cuttings yield more consistent results. This slow-growing shrub thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring well-drained, fertile soil and regular watering during dry periods.</p>
<p>Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or heathers enhances its visual appeal in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer argutum f. latialatum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers. Its dense growth acts as a companion plant in landscaping, enhancing biodiversity in gardens. The plant also contributes to erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving soil quality and supporting local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer argutum f. latialatum is a variant of the maple tree known for its ornamental value and use in landscaping.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it suitable for furniture and carving. In traditional medicine, parts of the plant may be used for their potential anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation is limited. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and adaptability, often featured in local art and horticultural practices.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems also supports biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer argutum f. latialatum has a limited number of recognized cultivars, with 'Baillyi' and 'Koerberi' being among the most popular for their striking foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is also used as a parent in hybridization efforts, contributing to the development of other maple varieties with enhanced traits. Hybrid forms often exhibit broader leaves and more vivid fall colors, making them desirable in horticulture. These hybrids are frequently used in garden settings for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer argutum f. latialatum holds significant horticultural importance due to its ornamental qualities and role in breeding programs.</p>
