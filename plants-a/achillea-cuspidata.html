                <h1>Achillea cuspidata</h1>
<p>Achillea cuspidata, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feathery leaves that are gray-green in color and emit a subtle aromatic scent. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its purported wound-healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea cuspidata has compound, pinnatifid leaves that are gray-green in color, with a rough, hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a greenish-brown bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flower heads are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene, with pappus hairs that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea cuspidata is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It has a limited current distribution, primarily found in the rocky and alpine areas of these regions. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments with well-drained soil, often growing on slopes and in meadows. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat degradation, Achillea cuspidata is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea cuspidata is a hardy perennial known for its upright growth and finely divided, feathery foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with new growth emerging in spring and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after blooming helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its appearance and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea cuspidata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other flora in its vicinity. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea cuspidata is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, known for its medicinal properties and ornamental value.</p>
