                <h1>Achillea cuspidata</h1>
<p>Achillea cuspidata, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces flat-topped clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Achillea cuspidata is often grown in gardens for its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea cuspidata has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, slightly hairy, and range in color from gray-green to dark green, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and reddish-brown in color, growing in a clump-like pattern. Its flowers are white to pale yellow, consisting of small ray florets surrounded by yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersing by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea cuspidata is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of Tibet.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to specific high-altitude areas in these regions. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is commonly found in alpine meadows and slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes between 2,500 and 5,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea cuspidata is considered to be of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea cuspidata is a hardy perennial known for its bright yellow flowers and ability to thrive in various garden settings.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing established clumps, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, often blooming in early to mid-summer and entering dormancy in late fall.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering that can lead to root rot. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. While generally pest and disease resistant, it may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea cuspidata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, which contribute to the ecosystem's biodiversity. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its aromatic properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea cuspidata offers ecological benefits by supporting local insect populations and promoting a healthy garden environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea cuspidata is a flowering plant known for its potential medicinal uses, including its traditional applications in treating ailments such as inflammation and digestive issues.</p>
<p>It has also been explored for its possible culinary uses, though it is not as commonly used in cooking as other members of the Asteraceae family. In industrial contexts, its essential oils may find applications in perfumery or as natural pesticides. Culturally, it has symbolic significance in some regions, often associated with healing and protection.</p>
<p>However, its applications remain largely under-researched compared to more widely studied plants.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea cuspidata has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Purpurea' and 'Aurea,' which are noted for their striking purple and golden foliage, respectively. Hybrids of Achillea cuspidata are often developed to enhance flower color, plant form, and disease resistance. These plants are of horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and their long blooming period.</p>
<p>They are widely used in gardens and landscapes for their aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
