                <h1>Acrostichum tatei</h1>
<p>Acrostichum tatei, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Acrostichum tatei is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tatei has large, elongated, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a dense rosette pattern, typically ranging from 30 to 60 centimeters in length and 5 to 10 centimeters in width, with a deep green color and a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a rough, fibrous bark that is usually dark brown in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tatei is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in coastal and mangrove ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant in tropical gardens.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific habitats, making it an important indicator species for coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tatei was mainly introduced to new environments as an ornamental plant due to its attractive fronds and adaptability.</p>
<p>It has been distributed across tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its aesthetic value. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
