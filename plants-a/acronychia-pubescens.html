                <h1>Acronychia pubescens</h1>
<p>Acronychia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to northern Australia, particularly Queensland, and is characterized by its rough, peeling bark and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia pubescens has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale greyish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in inflorescences, and bloom during the wet season; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia pubescens is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. This plant typically grows in rainforest or coastal environments. It is often seen in lowland and undulating terrain.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the eastern part of Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia pubescens was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. The plant has been cultivated in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread into natural ecosystems.</p>
