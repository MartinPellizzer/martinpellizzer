                    <h1>Alectorolophus contrinensis</h1>
<p>Alectorolophus contrinensis, commonly known as the Contrin's lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its leathery, greenish-gray thallus with distinct lobes. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients. It is often found on bark, stones, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
