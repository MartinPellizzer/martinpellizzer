                        <h1>Acanthopanax brachypus</h1>
<p>Acanthopanax brachypus, commonly known as the short-stemmed Chinese angel's trumpet, is a climbing shrub native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax brachypus is primarily native to East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate forest regions, often growing in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in regions with a humid climate and partial shade. It is particularly prevalent in the northern parts of China, such as Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes mixed deciduous and coniferous forests, where it contributes to the local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax brachypus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, waste grounds, and forest edges. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate partial to full sunlight. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in regions beyond its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is often monitored in ecological studies to assess its impact on local flora.</p>
