                <h1>Acourtia caltepecana</h1>
<p>Acourtia caltepecana, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to central Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces capsule fruits that contain toxic, seed-like structures, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acourtia caltepecana is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrubland habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia caltepecana has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring five pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia caltepecana is primarily native to Mexico Central.</p>
<p>It is found in the central regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Hidalgo, Puebla, and Tlaxcala. This plant typically grows in rocky and disturbed soils, often in open areas such as slopes and hillsides. It is adapted to the dry and semi-arid climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia caltepecana was mainly introduced to the central valleys of Mexico, particularly in the states of Puebla and Oaxaca.</p>
<p>It was brought into these regions as part of early agricultural practices by indigenous communities. The plant thrived in the fertile volcanic soils and temperate climate of the area. It became an important component of local ecosystems and traditional farming systems.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has also led to concerns about its potential impact on native flora.</p>
