                <h1>Acourtia caltepecana</h1>
<p>Acourtia caltepecana, commonly known as the Caltepec daisy, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a daisy-like pattern. It typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils in open habitats.</p>
<p>Acourtia caltepecana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia caltepecana has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green, glossy upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, typically measuring between 2 to 5 centimeters in length. The stem is woody and cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring and pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia caltepecana is a rare plant species native to the highlands of central Mexico, specifically in the states of Hidalgo, Puebla, and Tlaxcala.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations within its native range, primarily in the Sierra Madre del Oriental mountain range. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. This species is typically found at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acourtia caltepecana is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acourtia caltepecana is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant native to Mexico, known for its ornamental foliage and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Acourtia caltepecana is relatively slow, with new growth occurring primarily in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between waterings. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in spring, while pruning is generally minimal but can help shape the plant. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acourtia caltepecana is a native plant that provides essential food and shelter for local wildlife and pollinators.</p>
<p>It attracts bees, butterflies, and other pollinators with its nectar-rich flowers, supporting biodiversity in its ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acourtia caltepecana contributes to nutrient cycling and maintains the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acourtia caltepecana is a lesser-known plant native to Mexico, primarily found in the Sierra Madre del Sur region.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it has been traditionally utilized in local communities for its medicinal properties, particularly for treating respiratory ailments and skin conditions. Its presence in traditional healing practices highlights its cultural and symbolic significance among indigenous groups. Due to its limited distribution and ecological niche, it has minimal industrial or economic impact.</p>
<p>However, further research could uncover potential applications in herbal medicine or conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acourtia caltepecana has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegata' and 'Purpurea', which are appreciated for their striking foliage and unique coloration. While hybrids of Acourtia caltepecana are less common, they are occasionally developed to enhance traits such as cold tolerance and flower size. These plants hold horticultural importance as they are used in native gardens and as specimens in rockeries.</p>
<p>Their limited cultivation makes them a sought-after addition to specialized plant collections.</p>
