                        <h1>Acalypha macrostachyos</h1>
<p>Acalypha macrostachyos, commonly known as the glossy abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety green leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha macrostachyos is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist lowland forests and disturbed areas. This plant is commonly associated with wetland habitats and can be found near streams and along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of Oceania, including New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends to some regions of the Pacific Islands where the climate supports its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha macrostachyos was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for landscaping. The plant has since become naturalized in some areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and can often be found in disturbed habitats and along streambanks.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a concern in certain regions where it may outcompete native vegetation.</p>
