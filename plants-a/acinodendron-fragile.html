                <h1>Acinodendron fragile</h1>
<p>Acinodendron fragile, commonly known as the brittle acinodendron, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acinodendron fragile is often found in open woodlands and savannas, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron fragile has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron fragile is primarily native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Cameroon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist forest habitats and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>
<p>It is not found outside of its native range in Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron fragile was mainly introduced to Hawaii as part of an ornamental plant collection.</p>
<p>It was brought to the islands in the early 20th century by horticultural enthusiasts who admired its unique foliage. Despite its aesthetic appeal, the plant has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in wet forest ecosystems. Its rapid spread has led to concerns about biodiversity loss in these sensitive habitats.</p>
<p>Efforts are now underway to control its population and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
