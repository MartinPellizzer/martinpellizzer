                <h1>Achillea alpina subsp. rhodoptarmica</h1>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>rhodoptarmica, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, bright yellow to orange-red flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is known for its aromatic leaves and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different flower coloration compared to other members of the Achillea alpina species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>rhodoptarmica has leaves that are narrow and linear, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture. The stem is upright, smooth, and reddish-brown, growing in a compact, bushy pattern.</p>
<p>Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pink to red ray flowers, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant anchor in rocky or alpine soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>rhodoptarmica is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, including parts of the Carpathian Mountains and the Alps. Its current distribution extends to some areas of Western Asia, though it remains primarily restricted to its native range.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in rocky, alpine meadows and grasslands, often growing in well-drained soils. It is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>rhodoptarmica is a low-growing perennial plant known for its bright yellow flowers and hardy nature. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme enhances its growth and provides natural pest deterrence.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>rhodoptarmica is a hardy perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its abundant yellow flowers.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant in alpine ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting other native flora. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and promoting nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>rhodoptarmica is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, known for its medicinal properties. It has been traditionally used in herbal medicine to treat digestive issues and as a diuretic.</p>
