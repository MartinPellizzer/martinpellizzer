<p>Asclepias graminea, commonly known as green milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like stems that grow up to 1 meter in height, with lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are arranged in umbels, typical of the milkweed genus. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species.</p>
<p>Its sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but essential for the survival of certain insects.</p>
