                <h1>Adiantum rectangulare</h1>
<p>Adiantum rectangulare, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum rectangulare is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant foliage and ease of care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum rectangulare has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often reddish-brown when young and turn green as they mature.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark. It does not produce flowers, as it is a fern and reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the leaves, and they are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum rectangulare is primarily native to Brazil Northeast and Brazil West-Central.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in the humid tropical regions of these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. The plant is well adapted to the warm and humid climate of its native range.</p>
<p>It is often seen growing in coastal and mountainous regions within these geographical areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum rectangulare was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its delicate, fern-like appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses where it is cultivated for its aesthetic value. The plant is native to Southeast Asia but has been introduced to various regions including parts of the United States and Europe. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in certain areas outside its native range.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread into natural ecosystems.</p>
