                    <h1>Acacia cheelii</h1>
<p>Acacia cheelii, commonly known as the cheelii acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage and produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often modified into phyllodes, which help reduce water loss in its dry environment. Acacia cheelii is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>
