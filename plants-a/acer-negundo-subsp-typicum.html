                <h1>Acer negundo subsp. typicum</h1>
<p>Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>typicum, commonly known as the box elder, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three to five leaflets, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring.</p>
<p>The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>typicum has palmate leaves that are 5-9 lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree or shrub.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and appear in clusters, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>typicum is a variant of the box elder tree native to eastern North America, specifically found in the United States and Canada. Its current distribution has expanded beyond its native range, with introductions in parts of Europe and Asia, where it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It thrives in a variety of environments, including moist soils in riparian zones, forests, and disturbed areas. This species typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from near sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not considered endangered, its introduction to non-native regions has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>typicum is a fast-growing, deciduous tree known for its adaptability and ornamental value. It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seed propagation being the most common method. The tree has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few years, making it suitable for quick landscape development.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be moderate, and pruning is recommended to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>typicum is a versatile deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its seeds are consumed by birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It acts as an effective erosion control plant due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil. Additionally, it serves as a companion plant in urban landscapes, offering aesthetic value and improving air quality.</p>
<p>This species also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and enhancing habitat structure in forest edges and riparian areas.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>typicum is a fast-growing tree that has limited culinary use due to its bitter and toxic sap, though its young leaves may be occasionally used in some traditional dishes. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported ability to treat ailments such as skin conditions and respiratory issues.</p>
<p>Industrially, it is valued for its rapid growth, making it useful for windbreaks, erosion control, and as a source of timber in some regions. Culturally, it is often planted for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage, and in some areas, it symbolizes resilience and adaptability.</p>
<p>However, its applications are generally more ecological and utilitarian than widespread in other categories.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>typicum has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental qualities, including 'Autumn Flame' and 'Crimson King', which are known for their vibrant fall colors. It also has several hybrids with other maple species, such as Acer x pensylvanicum, which are often used in landscape design.</p>
<p>These hybrids and cultivars are valued for their adaptability to different climates and soil conditions. The species is important in horticulture due to its fast growth and ability to thrive in urban environments.</p>
<p>Its aesthetic appeal makes it a popular choice for parks, streetscapes, and residential gardens.</p>
