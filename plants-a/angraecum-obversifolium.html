                    <h1>Angraecum obversifolium</h1>
<p>Angraecum obversifolium, commonly known as the upward-leaved orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique upward-facing leaves, which give it its common name, and its elongated, pendant flower spikes that bear fragrant, white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are pollinated by moths, a relationship that highlights its adaptation to nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
