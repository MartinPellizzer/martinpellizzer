                    <h1>Agave × rossellonensis</h1>
<p>Agave × rossellonensis, commonly known as the Rosellón agave, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Agave americana and Agave victoriae-reginae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in Spain and Portugal. The plant features a rosette of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often lined with sharp spines. It produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white to yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
