                <h1>Acmella tenella</h1>
<p>Acmella tenella, commonly known as the spurge flower or the false shamrock, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant produces small, green, oval-shaped fruits called cypsela, which are typically covered in fine hairs. Acmella tenella is often found in moist, disturbed soils and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella tenella has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that grows upright. Its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central black spot, arranged in a cluster, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when the fruit dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella tenella is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, including countries such as Mexico, Belize, and Honduras.</p>
<p>It is now also found in some regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Peru. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in tropical rainforests and along riverbanks. It is commonly found at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acmella tenella is currently listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not under immediate threat of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella tenella is a compact, flowering plant known for its vibrant yellow blooms and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the plant's genetic traits. The growth cycle of Acmella tenella is typically annual, with rapid growth during the warm months and dormancy in cooler seasons.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmella tenella is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and insects, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other species to enhance soil health and deter pests. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acmella tenella offers ecological benefits by supporting pollinator populations and promoting a balanced garden environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acmella tenella is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and diverse applications.</p>
<p>In culinary use, its leaves are sometimes consumed as a vegetable in traditional dishes, particularly in parts of South America. Medicinally, it has been used in traditional medicine to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions due to its bioactive compounds. Industrially, it contributes to local economies through horticulture and ornamental plant trade.</p>
