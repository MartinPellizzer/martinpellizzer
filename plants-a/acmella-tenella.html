                <h1>Acmella tenella</h1>
<p>Acmella tenella, commonly known as the zigzag coralplant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Acmella tenella is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking visual appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella tenella has small, round, and fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a bright green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a greenish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly hairy. The flowers are yellow with a central white spot, resembling a daisy, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella tenella is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the regions of the Amazon Basin and the Pantanal wetlands. This plant thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often associated with riverbanks and seasonally flooded areas. It is also present in parts of Central America, including Mexico and Guatemala.</p>
<p>Acmella tenella is known for its bright yellow flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella tenella was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an environmental weed in certain regions of the country. The plant spreads rapidly through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. It often colonizes disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is now a target for control and management efforts.</p>
