<p>Andropogon subunifoveolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland and marshy habitats, where it forms dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form extensive colonies.</p>
<p>Andropogon subunifoveolatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
