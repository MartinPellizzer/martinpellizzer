                    <h1>Anemone rupestris var. spatulata</h1>
<p>Anemone rupestris var. spatulata, commonly known as the spoon-leaved anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments in the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are broad and spoon-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are typically clustered in a single umbel. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>The leaves and flowers are often covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance and ecological adaptations.</p>
