                <h1>Acrocentron granatense</h1>
<p>Acrocentron granatense, commonly known as the Granada spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and sunny locations. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in umbels, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>It is part of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its diverse and often toxic species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocentron granatense has leaves that are simple, ovate, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, and have a pale yellow color, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soil conditions and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocentron granatense is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Spain, Italy, and Greece. This plant thrives in rocky and coastal areas, often growing on cliffs or in dry, sunny environments. It is also present in parts of North Africa, including Morocco and Algeria.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to limestone substrates and maritime climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocentron granatense was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive in partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with moderate rainfall and mild winters, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens and landscapes. This plant is often used as an ornamental species due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. Its introduction has been largely driven by horticultural interests and its ability to withstand urban environments.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in native habitats.</p>
