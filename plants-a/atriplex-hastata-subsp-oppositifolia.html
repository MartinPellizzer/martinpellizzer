<p>Atriplex hastata subsp.</p>
<p>oppositifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are opposite in arrangement, giving it its subspecies name. It produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in saline conditions.</p>
