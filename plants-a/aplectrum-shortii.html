                    <h1>Aplectrum shortii</h1>
<p>Aplectrum shortii, commonly known as the short's adder's tongue, is a rare and endangered species of orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, leaf-like bracts that resemble the tongue of a snake, a feature that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, typically on a single stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as cedar glades and pine flatwoods.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
