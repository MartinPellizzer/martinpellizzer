                    <h1>Adenostyles alpina</h1>
<p>Adenostyles alpina, commonly known as the alpine adenostyle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in rocky or sandy soils, and it is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Adenostyles alpina plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
