                <h1>Adenostyles alpina</h1>
<p>Adenostyles alpina, commonly known as the alpine adenostyle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in rocky or sandy soils, and it is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Adenostyles alpina plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles alpina has narrow, needle-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and range in size from 1 to 3 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale gray bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a creeping or ascending manner. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with tubular corollas, typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to anchor itself in rocky or alpine soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles alpina is primarily native to Albania, Austria, France, Germany, Italy, NW.</p>
<p>Balkan Pen., Sicilia, Spain, and Switzerland. This plant is commonly found in alpine and subalpine regions across these countries.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and mountainous terrain, often growing in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. Its distribution reflects its adaptation to cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The species is relatively rare and is considered a characteristic flora of the European Alps and adjacent regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles alpina was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open, sunny areas such as disturbed soils, roadsides, and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in dry, well-drained environments and is often associated with chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats. It has become naturalized in some regions, posing potential competition to native plant species.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been largely due to human activity, including seed dispersal through disturbed landscapes.</p>
