                    <h1>Agrostis rura</h1>
<p>Agrostis rura, commonly known as rough bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue-green flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Agrostis rura is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites, thriving in partial shade to full sun.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and establish quickly, making it a common component of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
