                            <h1>Agropyron Cristatum</h1>
<p>Agropyron cristatum, also known as crested wheatgrass, is a hardy perennial grass native to the cold climates of Eurasia. It is widely used for soil stabilization and erosion control due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. This plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is commonly found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its distinctive crown-like appearance comes from its unique leaf structure and seed heads. Despite its ecological benefits, it has also been introduced to other regions as a forage crop and land rehabilitation tool.</p>
