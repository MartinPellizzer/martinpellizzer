                    <h1>Alnus cordata f. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Alnus cordata f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved alder, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Alnus cordata. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a brownish color, containing seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically alternate and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance.</p>
