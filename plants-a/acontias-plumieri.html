                <h1>Acontias plumieri</h1>
<p>Acontias plumieri, commonly known as the pink morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pink or purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces slender, winding stems that climb or trail along the ground. Its flowers are typically trumpet-shaped and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Acontias plumieri is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acontias plumieri has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length and 2-4 cm in width. The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acontias plumieri is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and mangrove ecosystems along the shores of countries such as Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico. This plant thrives in humid, saline environments and is often associated with brackish water habitats. Its distribution is largely restricted to tropical and subtropical coastal zones in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shoreline vegetation and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acontias plumieri was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has established itself in various regions outside its native range, often in disturbed or urban environments. The plant's ability to thrive in different soil types and its rapid growth rate contribute to its successful spread. It is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts and the need for management strategies.</p>
