                    <h1>Athyrium × megayakusimense</h1>
<p>Athyrium × megayakusimense, commonly known as the giant Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Athyrium niponicum and Athyrium yokoscense.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed, and often silvery-green fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
