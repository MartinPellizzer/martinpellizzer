                <h1>Adenolinum alpicola</h1>
<p>Adenolinum alpicola, commonly known as the alpine adenolinum, is a rare and delicate plant species native to high-altitude regions of the Alps.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Adenolinum alpicola is considered endangered and is often found in rocky or alpine meadows.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenolinum alpicola has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, covered in a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are pale blue in color, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky, alpine soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolinum alpicola is primarily native to the high mountain regions of southern Europe, particularly the Alps and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine environments characterized by cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in rocky crevices and meadows at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that provide the necessary conditions for its growth.</p>
<p>Adenolinum alpicola is an endemic species, meaning it is found nowhere else in the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolinum alpicola was mainly introduced to areas with high altitudes and cool, moist climates, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This plant is native to the European Alps but has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America and Asia. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful monitoring is necessary to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
