<p>It is characterized by its unique structure, featuring a central calyx surrounded by arms that are used for filter feeding. The plant has a sessile lifestyle, attaching itself to the ocean floor with a stalk-like stem. Its body is covered in small, calcareous plates that provide structural support and protection.</p>
<p>Acanthopleura plays an important ecological role in marine environments by contributing to biodiversity and serving as a habitat for smaller organisms.</p>
