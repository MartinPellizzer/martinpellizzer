<p>Aeschynomene fluitans, commonly known as floating bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating, bladder-like structures that aid in buoyancy and gas exchange. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It has a fibrous root system that helps anchor it in shallow waters.</p>
<p>Aeschynomene fluitans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
