<p>Anychiastrum riparium, commonly known as river sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along riverbanks and dry streambeds. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Anychiastrum riparium is well-suited for xeriscaping and can serve as a valuable component in drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
