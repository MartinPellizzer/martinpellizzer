                    <h1>Alsophila laeta</h1>
<p>Alsophila laeta, commonly known as the silver tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of ferns. Alsophila laeta thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation.</p>
