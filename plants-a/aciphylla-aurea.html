                <h1>Aciphylla aurea</h1>
<p>Aciphylla aurea, commonly known as the golden cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form composed of numerous small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense heads. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of white, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Aciphylla aurea is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal and alpine regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla aurea has a rosette-forming structure with thick, fleshy leaves that are spoon-shaped, arranged in a tight spiral, and range in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically gray-green in color, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss. The stem is short and stout, with a rough, bark-like texture that is usually a pale greenish-brown color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds, and the roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant survive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>

<p>It is commonly found in the southern regions of New Zealand, including the South Island. This plant thrives in coastal and mountainous areas with well-drained soils. It is often seen in rocky and gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Aciphylla aurea is an important part of the local flora and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla aurea was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the dry, coastal areas of the North Island. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen growing in dunes and rocky outcrops. It is known for its yellow flowers and is a symbol of the New Zealand landscape.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily.</p>
