                <h1>Acronia complanata</h1>
<p>Acronia complanata, commonly known as the flatleaf acronia, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its flat, broad leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used in traditional herbal remedies for various ailments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia complanata has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia complanata is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with abundant moisture. It is often associated with coastal areas and is sometimes found in disturbed or riparian zones.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia complanata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and well-drained soil. The plant is commonly found in the eastern and central United States, where it has spread due to human activity and habitat fragmentation. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and anthropogenic landscapes.</p>
<p>This distribution pattern suggests a preference for disturbed sites and a capacity for rapid colonization.</p>
