<p>Alsine graminifolia var. clandestina, commonly known as the secret grass, is a rare and elusive plant species characterized by its low-growing, grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>It typically features slender, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in damp woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
