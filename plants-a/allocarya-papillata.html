<p>Allocarya papillata, commonly known as the hairy pincushion cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems covered in small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Allocarya papillata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
