                    <h1>Agrostis variabilis</h1>
<p>Agrostis variabilis, commonly known as variable bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has fine, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Agrostis variabilis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
