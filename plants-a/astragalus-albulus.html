                    <h1>Astragalus albulus</h1>
<p>Astragalus albulus, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus albulus is adapted to dry conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
