                <h1>Adicea macrodonta</h1>
<p>Adicea macrodonta, commonly known as the large-flowered adicea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Adicea macrodonta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea macrodonta has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough bark that is grayish-brown in color, and it grows in a bushy, upright pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after drying.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea macrodonta is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. This plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soils, often growing near streams or in shaded undergrowth. It is a climbing vine that can reach significant lengths, making it a notable species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adicea macrodonta is also occasionally found in parts of southern China and the Indian subcontinent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea macrodonta was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often along stream banks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through underground rhizomes have made it a concern for local conservation efforts.</p>
