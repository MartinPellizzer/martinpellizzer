                <h1>Aechmea excavata</h1>
<p>Aechmea excavata, commonly known as the cup-leaved bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and provides a habitat for various small organisms. The plant's leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Aechmea excavata produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the leaf rosette.</p>
<p>This bromeliad is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea excavata has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, stiff, and often recurved, arranged in a tight spiral around the central rosette, with a dark green to bluish-gray color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, compact stem that is often hidden beneath the leaves, with a smooth, pale green bark. Its flowers are spike-like, with vibrant red bracts that enclose small, white to yellowish flowers, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by hummingbirds. The fruit is a capsule that produces small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its rocky or bromeliad-like habitat.</p>
