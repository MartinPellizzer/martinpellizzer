                <h1>Adenocalymma velutinum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma velutinum, commonly known as the velvetleaf sturtshrub, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, preferring well-drained soils. It has a woody stem with a distinctive, often branched structure.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma velutinum is adapted to withstand drought and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma velutinum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a velvety texture and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a compact, upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the cooler months of spring and autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma velutinum is primarily native to Brazil North.</p>
<p>It is found in the northern regions of Brazil, particularly in the Amazonian area. This plant thrives in the humid tropical climate of the region. It is commonly found in dense rainforests and swampy areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the ecological conditions of the northern Brazilian rainforests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma velutinum was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands and along roadsides, particularly in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant is known for its hairy, velvety leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is often used as a decorative plant in gardens due to its ornamental appearance.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
