                <h1>Adonis dentata</h1>
<p>Adonis dentata, commonly known as the toothed adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant features a short, hairy stem with palmately divided leaves, and its flowers are usually pink or white with prominent yellow stamens. Adonis dentata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis dentata has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm long and have finely serrated edges.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are bright yellow, with showy, petal-like structures arranged in a cup-shaped cluster, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The plant produces follicle fruits that split open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system consists of a taproot with lateral branches, allowing it to anchor deeply and access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis dentata is primarily native to Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon-Syria, Libya, Pakistan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Sinai, Transcaucasus, Turkmenistan, and Yemen.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in dry, rocky, and mountainous regions across these areas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on limestone or sandstone substrates. Adonis dentata is known for its showy yellow flowers, which bloom in spring.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans across parts of the Middle East, Central Asia, and the eastern Mediterranean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis dentata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils. The plant is often found in the northern hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Its introduction is largely due to human activities, including horticulture and accidental spread through contaminated soil or seeds.</p>
<p>It has become naturalized in several regions, sometimes competing with native plant species.</p>
