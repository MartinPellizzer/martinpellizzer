                    <h1>Avenastrum alpinum</h1>
<p>Avenastrum alpinum, commonly known as alpine oat, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, where it forms dense mats on rocky soils and scree slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to harsh climates with strong winds and low temperatures, making it a resilient component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>Avenastrum alpinum plays a role in preventing soil erosion and provides habitat for various alpine invertebrates.</p>
