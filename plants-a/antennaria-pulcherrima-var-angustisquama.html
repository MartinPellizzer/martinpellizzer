<p>Antennaria pulcherrima var. angustisquama, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers, which bloom in early spring, are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, rounded seeds in a dry, pod-like structure.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in xerophytic environments.</p>
