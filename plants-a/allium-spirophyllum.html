                    <h1>Allium spirophyllum</h1>
<p>Allium spirophyllum, commonly known as the spiral garlic, is a rare and intriguing plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. Its bulbs, similar to those of other Allium species, are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>However, due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
