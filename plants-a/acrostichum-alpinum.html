                <h1>Acrostichum alpinum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine fern, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically evergreen. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to steep slopes, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum alpinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum alpinum has leaves that are elongated, narrow, and sword-shaped, with a dark green color and a smooth texture, arranged in a dense, feather-like pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, relying on wind pollination for reproduction. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its tiny seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, helping it anchor in rocky or alpine soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum alpinum is primarily native to the high mountain regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. This plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments at elevations above 3,000 meters. It is adapted to the cold and harsh conditions of these high-altitude areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the Andean range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum alpinum was mainly introduced to areas with high altitudes and cool climates, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in alpine regions and mountainous environments across its native range in Southeast Asia. This plant has been introduced to various parts of the world, including parts of Europe and North America, as an ornamental species. Its introduction has sometimes led to its establishment in natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains largely restricted to specific ecological niches.</p>
