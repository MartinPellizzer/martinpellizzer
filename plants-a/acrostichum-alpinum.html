                    <h1>Acrostichum alpinum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine fern, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically evergreen. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to steep slopes, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum alpinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
