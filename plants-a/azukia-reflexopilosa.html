                    <h1>Azukia reflexopilosa</h1>
<p>Azukia reflexopilosa, commonly known as the hairy reflexed clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Azukia reflexopilosa is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, making it beneficial for soil fertility.</p>
