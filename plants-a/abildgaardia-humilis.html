                        <h1>Abildgaardia humilis</h1>
<p>Abildgaardia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf abildgaardia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered umbels of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically reaches a height of less than 10 centimeters, with hairy, narrow leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia humilis is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Western Cape Province, where it grows in rocky outcrops and coastal areas. This plant thrives in Mediterranean climates characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It is commonly found in fynbos vegetation, which is a unique type of shrubland.</p>
<p>Abildgaardia humilis is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal sand dunes and cliffs.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia humilis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. Despite its beauty, it has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
