                <h1>Aechmea micrantha</h1>
<p>Aechmea micrantha, commonly known as the pink pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The plant produces inflorescences with small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Aechmea micrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea micrantha has rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, underground rhizome that supports the rosette structure. Its flowers are small, clustered in a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, with white to pale pink petals and a blooming period during the summer months. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, particularly beetles and flies.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animal consumption.</p>
