<p>Atriplex lindleyi subsp.</p>
<p>inflata, commonly known as the inflated saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically in the spring. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves allows it to survive in low-water conditions.</p>
