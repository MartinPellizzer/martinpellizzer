                    <h1>Anthericum arvense</h1>
<p>Anthericum arvense, commonly known as field garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a dense umbel. The plant has a strong, pungent odor reminiscent of garlic due to the presence of sulfur-containing compounds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Anthericum arvense is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
