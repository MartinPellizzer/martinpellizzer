                    <h1>Ancistrorhynchus capitatus</h1>
<p>Ancistrorhynchus capitatus, commonly known as the yellow-bellied river catfish, is a freshwater fish native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loricariidae, which includes many armored catfish species. The plant in question is not applicable, as Ancistrorhynchus capitatus is a fish, not a plant. Therefore, there are no botanical aspects to discuss.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
