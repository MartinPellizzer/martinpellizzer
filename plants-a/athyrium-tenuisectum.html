                    <h1>Athyrium tenuisectum</h1>
<p>Athyrium tenuisectum, commonly known as the narrow-parted fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are finely divided. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous upright, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
