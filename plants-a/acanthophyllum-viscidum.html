                        <h1>Acanthophyllum viscidum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum viscidum, commonly known as the sticky acanthophyllum, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stems are often covered in a sticky resin, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in conditions with limited water availability.</p>
