<p>Allocasuarina diminuta subsp.</p>
<p>diminuta, commonly known as the small-leaved she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its reduced, needle-like leaves that are clustered at the base of the twigs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for various native fauna. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to coastal conditions and its role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
