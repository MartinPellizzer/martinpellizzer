                <h1>Acrostichum urvillei</h1>
<p>Acrostichum urvillei, commonly known as the broadleaf tree fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk covered in a thick layer of persistent, fibrous roots. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the fronds, and it relies on spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Acrostichum urvillei thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum urvillei has large, elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are usually bright green and arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and cylindrical, with a rough, fibrous bark that is typically a deep brown color. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in wet, muddy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum urvillei is primarily native to New Caledonia.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the island, where it thrives in humid and warm climates. It typically grows in coastal areas and lowland forests, often near the shoreline. Acrostichum urvillei is an evergreen fern that plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to New Caledonia, making it a unique and endemic species in that region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum urvillei was mainly introduced to wetland and riparian areas where it can thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable species for rehabilitating degraded habitats.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in some environments if not managed properly.</p>
