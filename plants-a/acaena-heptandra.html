                        <h1>Acaena heptandra</h1>
<p>Acaena heptandra, commonly known as the seven-angled burr plant, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spherical fruits that are covered in hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. Acaena heptandra thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena heptandra is primarily native to South America, specifically Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate regions, particularly in the Andes Mountains. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with shrublands and forest edges. It is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern parts of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena heptandra was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly common in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
