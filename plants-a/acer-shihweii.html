                <h1>Acer shihweii</h1>
<p>Acer shihweii, commonly known as the Shihwei maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red to orange-red leaves that turn vibrant hues in the fall. The plant belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and has a rounded crown.</p>
<p>The leaves are palmately lobed with five to seven pointed lobes, and the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer shihweii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree. The flowers are inconspicuous, greenish-yellow in color, and appear in early spring, with a wind pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer shihweii is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, making it one of the least known maple species. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, typically found in mixed forests. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation and habitat fragmentation, Acer shihweii is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer shihweii is a deciduous tree known for its striking red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer shihweii involves a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs like hydrangeas or perennials like hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal and ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer shihweii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and supporting a diverse range of organisms. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer shihweii contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through its photosynthetic processes.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer shihweii is a rare maple species native to China, primarily valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential nutritional value in traditional contexts. In traditional medicine, it has been used to treat ailments such as coughs and inflammation, though scientific validation remains limited. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for horticultural purposes, contributing to landscape design and botanical gardens.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and natural beauty, inspiring artistic and conservation efforts in its region.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer shihweii has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are highly valued in horticulture.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Cunninghamii' and 'Tigris,' which are known for their striking red foliage and ornamental appeal. The species is also a parent in various hybrids, such as the widely cultivated 'Autumn Flame' and 'Crimson Queen,' which combine the vibrant colors of Acer shihweii with other maple species. These cultivars and hybrids are prized for their fall color and adaptability to different climates.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer shihweii plays a significant role in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic value and genetic contribution to maple breeding programs.</p>
