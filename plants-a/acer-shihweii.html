                <h1>Acer shihweii</h1>
<p>Acer shihweii, commonly known as the Shihwei maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant autumn foliage, which ranges from red to orange and yellow. The tree has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5 to 9 inches long. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer shihweii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright green in summer and turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with yellow-green petals and stamens, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two wings, dispersing by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer shihweii is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan and Hubei.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Hengduan Mountains. It thrives in moist, temperate environments with well-drained soils, typically found in shaded forest understories. This species grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural reproduction, Acer shihweii is classified as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer shihweii is a unique maple species known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Acer shihweii includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a rest period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning should be done in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like lavender or sedum can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer shihweii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and supporting diverse plant life. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer shihweii contributes to carbon sequestration, improving air quality and supporting overall ecological health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer shihweii is a rare and ornamental tree native to China, primarily valued for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. The tree's unique foliage makes it a sought-after species in the ornamental plant trade, contributing to its economic value in the horticultural industry. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty due to its striking autumn colors, often inspiring artistic and poetic expressions.</p>
<p>Despite its limited practical applications, Acer shihweii plays a significant role in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer shihweii has several popular cultivars such as 'Cunninghamii', 'Dissectum', and 'Gumpo', which are prized for their striking foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also the parent species for several important hybrids, including the widely cultivated 'Crimson King' and 'Coralç„°', which exhibit enhanced coloration and adaptability. These cultivars and hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in a variety of garden settings. The species contributes significantly to the diversity of maple trees in landscaping and botanical collections.</p>
<p>Its genetic material plays a key role in the development of new maple varieties with improved traits for urban and suburban environments.</p>
