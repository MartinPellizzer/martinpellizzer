<p>Alkanna trichophila var. mardinensis, commonly known as the Mardin alkanna, is a rare and striking plant native to the region of Mardin in southeastern Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its vibrant red, silky-hair-covered seed pods that develop after flowering. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
