                <h1>Achillea millefolium f. rosea</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. rosea, commonly known as the pink yarrow, is a horticultural form of the common yarrow.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pink to rose-colored flowers, which contrast with the typical white flowers of the species. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. rosea has compound, feather-like leaves that are finely divided, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“15 cm in length, with a light green to silvery gray color.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, somewhat woody at the base, with a smooth, pale green to reddish-brown bark, and exhibit a branching growth pattern. The flowers are flat-topped umbels composed of small, showy pink to rose-colored petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. rosea is a cultivar of the common yarrow, known for its pinkish to reddish flower heads.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe, particularly in regions such as the British Isles and parts of southern Scandinavia. While it was originally a garden plant, it has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America and Australia. It thrives in well-drained soils in full sun, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>This cultivar is generally not considered a conservation concern due to its widespread cultivation and naturalization.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. rosea is a charming perennial known for its pinkish-white flowers and feathery foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a typical perennial growth cycle, blooming in early summer and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flower heads to encourage new growth and prevent disease. It is generally pest and disease resistant but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. rosea is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its bright pink flowers attract a variety of wildlife, including insects and small birds, contributing to biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its dense growth helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>This plant also offers ecological benefits by supporting local ecosystems and promoting healthy soil composition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. rosea is a variant of yarrow known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscaping due to its attractive pink or red flower heads.</p>
<p>While not commonly used in culinary applications, it can be occasionally used in herbal teas or infusions for its mild flavor. In medicinal contexts, it shares similar properties with common yarrow, such as anti-inflammatory and astringent effects, though its use is less documented. Industrially, it has limited economic value compared to other plants, but its role in horticulture contributes to the ornamental plant industry.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes protection and healing, much like its parent species, and is sometimes used in floral arrangements and traditional crafts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. rosea has several popular cultivars, including 'Snow Queen' and 'Pink Beauty,' which are prized for their delicate pink to white flower colors and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>These cultivars are often used in garden settings for their ornamental value and hardiness. Hybrids of this form have been developed to enhance traits such as bloom duration, disease resistance, and color intensity. The horticultural importance of Achillea millefolium f. rosea lies in its ability to thrive in various soil conditions and its role in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>It is a valuable addition to both traditional and modern garden designs.</p>
