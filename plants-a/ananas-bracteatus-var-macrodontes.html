<p>Ananas bracteatus var. macrodontes, commonly known as the giant pineapple or mountain pineapple, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its tall, upright stem and large, fleshy, spiky leaves that form a rosette shape. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its native high-altitude environment. It produces a single, showy flower that is often red or orange, emerging from the center of the leaf rosette.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its unique visual appeal.</p>
