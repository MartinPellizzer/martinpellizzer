                    <h1>Agropyron firmum</h1>
<p>Agropyron firmum, commonly known as the hardstem wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agropyron firmum is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable species for erosion control and forage.</p>
<p>Its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soils contribute to its ecological importance in native plant communities.</p>
