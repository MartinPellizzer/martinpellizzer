                <h1>Adenophora erecta</h1>
<p>Adenophora erecta, commonly known as the upright bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Adenophora erecta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora erecta has alternate, lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy and range in size from 2 to 6 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. The flowers are clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora erecta is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in forested areas and meadows at higher elevations. This species is adapted to well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its native range extends across the temperate zones of East Asia, where it is often part of the understory vegetation.</p>
<p>Adenophora erecta is also known for its bell-shaped flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora erecta was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there intentionally for ornamental purposes due to its attractive blue flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
