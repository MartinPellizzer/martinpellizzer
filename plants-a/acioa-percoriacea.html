                <h1>Acioa percoriacea</h1>
<p>Acioa percoriacea, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red or pink bract-like flowers that resemble coral, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Acioa percoriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acioa percoriacea has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa percoriacea is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forests and is commonly found in the Amazon Basin. This plant is often associated with shaded understory environments in primary and secondary rainforests. Its distribution is largely limited to the Neotropical region, where it plays a role in the ecological diversity of these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acioa percoriacea is becoming increasingly rare in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa percoriacea was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as an ornamental plant or for erosion control.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, leading to concerns about its ecological impact in non-native environments.</p>
