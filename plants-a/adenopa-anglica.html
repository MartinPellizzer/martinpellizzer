                <h1>Adenopa anglica</h1>
<p>Adenopa anglica, commonly known as the English adenopa, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm, featuring slender, upright stems that are often hairy. The plant produces small, pale yellow to green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from June to August. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, with a strong, aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Adenopa anglica is often found in moist meadows and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopa anglica has leaves that are simple, ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, usually with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a pale green to brownish bark that becomes rough with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in loose inflorescences, with five petals that are pinkish-white in color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopa anglica is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, specifically in countries such as South Africa, Lesotho, and Eswatini.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils found in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands. The plant is commonly found in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces of South Africa. It is adapted to the cooler and drier conditions of these regions.</p>
<p>Adenopa anglica is a hardy species that plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopa anglica was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread across various regions, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Although not considered highly invasive, it has the potential to outcompete native species in certain environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution continues to expand, prompting ongoing monitoring by conservation agencies.</p>
