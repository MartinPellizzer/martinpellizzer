                    <h1>Anthyllis vulneraria var. polyphylla</h1>
<p>Anthyllis vulneraria var. polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
