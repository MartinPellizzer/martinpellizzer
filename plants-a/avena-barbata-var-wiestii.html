<p>Avena barbata var. wiestii, commonly known as the Wiest's slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three bracts, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species.</p>
