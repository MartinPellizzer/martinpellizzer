                <h1>Acer ginnala f. angustilobum</h1>
<p>Acer ginnala f. angustilobum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 7 lobed, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin strips.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or streamside habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala f. angustilobum has palmate leaves that are finely lobed, with a maple-like shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5–10 cm in diameter, turning bright red in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, smooth, and reddish-brown, with a growth pattern that is upright and bushy. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during early spring, with a wind pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala f. angustilobum is a rare and critically endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan and Hubei.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is highly restricted, with only a few known populations remaining in the wild. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes, typically at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala f. angustilobum is a decorative maple known for its unique narrow leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seed propagation requiring cold stratification to break dormancy. The plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 5–10 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and consistent moisture, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala f. angustilobum is a small, deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in forested areas, enhancing the growth of other native species. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a diverse range of organisms within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala f. angustilobum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>It has been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though research is still in early stages. Industrially, it contributes to local ecosystems and may support biodiversity, though it lacks significant economic value in commercial industries. Culturally, it is appreciated for its ornamental value, particularly its striking red foliage, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents resilience and natural beauty in regions where it is native.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala f. angustilobum has several popular cultivars, including 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as *Acer palmatum*, to produce ornamental hybrids like 'Dissectum' and 'Emerald Queen'. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced hardiness and a wider range of leaf colors. The horticultural importance of this species lies in its adaptability to urban environments and its ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal and resilience, it remains a popular choice for ornamental landscaping in temperate regions.</p>
