<p>It features slender, cylindrical stems that are covered in fine, bristly hairs, providing protection against salt spray and wind. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that develop into berry-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are narrow and scale-like, reducing water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in dune habitats and is valued for its resilience and unique ecological role.</p>
