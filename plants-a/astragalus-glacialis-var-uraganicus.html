                    <h1>Astragalus glacialis var. uraganicus</h1>
<p>Astragalus glacialis var. uraganicus, commonly known as the Arctic milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is adapted to survive in cold, nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is often found in tundra and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it is considered a key indicator species of arctic ecosystems.</p>
