                <h1>Acrostichum tectum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum tectum, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they have a complex, feather-like structure with multiple subdivisions.</p>
<p>Acrostichum tectum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tectum has broad, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is stout and upright, with a smooth, dark brown bark that develops vertical ridges as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spadices, usually greenish-yellow in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, spiky capsule that disperses its seeds through wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively along the ground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tectum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and other moist lowland areas. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with riverbanks and coastal regions. Its natural range extends from southern Mexico through parts of the Caribbean to Argentina.</p>
<p>Acrostichum tectum is also occasionally found in Southeast Asia, though it is more widely distributed in the Americas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tectum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high rainfall and warm climates, such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. The plant is often used in landscaping due to its large, dark green fronds that provide a lush, tropical appearance. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded due to both natural spread and human introduction for horticultural purposes.</p>
