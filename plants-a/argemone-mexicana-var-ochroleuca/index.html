                            <h1>Argemone Mexicana Var. Ochroleuca</h1>
<p>Argemone mexicana var. ochroleuca is a strikingly colorful plant known for its bright yellow flowers and distinctive seed pods. Native to regions of southern Asia, it thrives in warm, arid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. This variant of the argemone plant is notable for its vivid hue, which sets it apart from other varieties. Despite its beauty, it is also considered a weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies. Its historical use in traditional medicine adds to its cultural and ecological significance.</p>
