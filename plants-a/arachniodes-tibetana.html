                    <h1>Arachniodes tibetana</h1>
<p>Arachniodes tibetana, commonly known as the Tibetan spider fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the mountainous regions of Tibet.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble the delicate patterns of a spider's web. The plant typically grows in cool, moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent in certain conditions, a rare trait among ferns, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Arachniodes tibetana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
