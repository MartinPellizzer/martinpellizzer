<p>Astracantha condensata, commonly known as the dense thorned cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a typical adaptation to arid environments.</p>
<p>Astracantha condensata is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to withstand drought conditions.</p>
