                <h1>Adinandra lasiostyla</h1>
<p>Adinandra lasiostyla, commonly known as the rough-stemmed adinandra, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and small, opposite leaves with a rough texture. It produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by small, round fruits.</p>
<p>Adinandra lasiostyla is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and shrublands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra lasiostyla has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release shiny, black seeds, which are dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or disturbed habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra lasiostyla is primarily native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the island, particularly in humid forests. The plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and moderate temperatures. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific elevational ranges within Taiwan's eastern and central regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra lasiostyla was mainly introduced to areas with specific ecological conditions, such as well-drained soils and moderate humidity.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats like roadsides and clearings. The plant has been observed in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land clearing and gardening.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
