                    <h1>Agrostis stolonifera var. aristata</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonifera var. aristata, commonly known as bentgrass with aristate leaves, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
