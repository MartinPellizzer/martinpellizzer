                    <h1>Acinodendron atrosanguineum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron atrosanguineum, commonly known as the black blood tree, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the tropical rainforests of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark that gives it its common name, and its unique, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
