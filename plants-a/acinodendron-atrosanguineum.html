                <h1>Acinodendron atrosanguineum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron atrosanguineum, commonly known as the black blood tree, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the tropical rainforests of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark that gives it its common name, and its unique, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron atrosanguineum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with pale pink or white petals, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron atrosanguineum is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these regions. The plant is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing along riverbanks and in disturbed forest undergrowth. It is known for its distinctive dark red or purplish bark and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron atrosanguineum was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates where it can thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens and as an ornamental plant. The plant's introduction has been primarily driven by its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types. However, its spread has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range, it is often cultivated in controlled environments rather than being a wild species.</p>
