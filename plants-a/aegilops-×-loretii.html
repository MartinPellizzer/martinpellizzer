                    <h1>Aegilops × loretii</h1>
<p>Aegilops × loretii, commonly known as the goatgrass hybrid, is a sterile, diploid plant that results from the cross between Aegilops tauschii and Triticum aestivum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Aegilops × loretii is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields, where it can become a weed.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic relationship with wheat, it is of interest in plant breeding for its potential contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
