                        <h1>Acacia aegyptiaca</h1>
<p>Acacia aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian acacia or sacred thorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the hot, arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, followed by woody pods containing flat, fibrous seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Acacia aegyptiaca has been used traditionally for its timber, gum, and medicinal properties.</p>
