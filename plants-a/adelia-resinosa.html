                <h1>Adelia resinosa</h1>
<p>Adelia resinosa, commonly known as the resinous adelia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its most notable feature is the secretion of a sticky, aromatic resin from its bark and leaves.</p>
<p>This resin has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for medicinal and ceremonial purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia resinosa has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets measuring approximately 2â€“4 cm in length, exhibiting a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color and exhibits an ascending growth pattern. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule containing small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia resinosa is primarily native to the arid regions of southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the states of Western Australia and South Australia. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to the dry, hot climate of its native habitat. It is often seen in coastal dunes and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where it can tolerate low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia resinosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste areas, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is often found in the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. It has become naturalized in some regions, spreading through both seeds and vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a potential invasive species in certain ecosystems.</p>
