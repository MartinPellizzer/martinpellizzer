                    <h1>Adelia resinosa</h1>
<p>Adelia resinosa, commonly known as the resinous adelia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its most notable feature is the secretion of a sticky, aromatic resin from its bark and leaves.</p>
<p>This resin has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for medicinal and ceremonial purposes.</p>
