<p>Acacia setigera, commonly known as the slender acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Acacia setigera is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry regions.</p>
