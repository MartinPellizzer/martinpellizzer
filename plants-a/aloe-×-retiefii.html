<p>Aloe × retiefii, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a hybrid succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features tall, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late winter or early spring, which are borne on tall, branched inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
<p>Aloe × retiefii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions.</p>
