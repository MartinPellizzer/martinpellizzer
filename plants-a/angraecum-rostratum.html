                    <h1>Angraecum rostratum</h1>
<p>Angraecum rostratum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical forests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence bearing numerous fragrant, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant has a unique rosette-shaped growth pattern with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often-dry habitat. Its flowers open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths, which is a rare trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after in horticulture but is also threatened by habitat loss.</p>
