                    <h1>Aloe lingua var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Aloe lingua var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features tall, upright stems that produce clusters of narrow, fleshy leaves with a bluish-green color. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces yellowish-green flowers in summer, which are arranged in panicle-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
