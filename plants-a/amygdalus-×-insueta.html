                    <h1>Amygdalus × insueta</h1>
<p>Amygdalus × insueta, commonly known as the wild almond or bitter almond, is a hybrid species within the Prunus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, hard seeds encased in a woody pod, which contain a toxic compound called amygdalin. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes rather than for its edible nuts.</p>
