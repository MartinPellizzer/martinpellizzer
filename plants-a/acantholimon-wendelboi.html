                        <h1>Acantholimon wendelboi</h1>
<p>Acantholimon wendelboi, commonly known as the Wendelbo's thornscale, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Plumbagaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Mediterranean, particularly in Cyprus and Turkey. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
