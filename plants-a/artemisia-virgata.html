                    <h1>Artemisia virgata</h1>
<p>Artemisia virgata, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in rounded or oval shapes. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Artemisia virgata is also noted for its aromatic properties, with a strong, camphor-like scent when the leaves are crushed.</p>
