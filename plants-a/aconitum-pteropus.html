                <h1>Aconitum pteropus</h1>
<p>Aconitum pteropus, commonly known as the Chinese aconite or monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue or purple spurred flowers arranged in a raceme, which are characteristic of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>However, all parts of the plant contain potent toxins, making it highly dangerous to handle or ingest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum pteropus has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are large, deeply lobed, and typically green with a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, dark brown bark that has a somewhat fibrous texture. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in racemes, and have a spurred structure typical of the genus, blooming in late summer and attracting pollinators like bees through nectar. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, thick, and serve as storage organs for nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum pteropus is primarily native to Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Korean Peninsula. This species thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with rocky or forested habitats. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>The plant's native range is limited to specific areas within Korea, where it has adapted to the local environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum pteropus was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions where it can establish itself along stream banks, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. The plant is often found in the wild in parts of Asia, Europe, and North America. Its introduction to new environments can lead to ecological impacts due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>It is important to monitor its spread to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
