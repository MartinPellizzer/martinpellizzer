                <h1>Acinodendron radula</h1>
<p>Acinodendron radula, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The plant features showy, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. Its leaves are velvety and heart-shaped, often with a distinctive waxy coating.</p>
<p>Acinodendron radula is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron radula has leaves that are simple, alternate, and elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a bushy habit. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron radula is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and ample rainfall. This plant is commonly found in dense rainforests and secondary growth habitats. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the climatic conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron radula was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils where it can establish itself quickly. This plant has shown a high degree of adaptability to different environmental conditions. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>However, more research is needed to fully understand its ecological effects.</p>
