<p>Anathallis klingelfusii, commonly known as the golden spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble spider-like structures, which are adapted for specific pollination by certain flies. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region.</p>
