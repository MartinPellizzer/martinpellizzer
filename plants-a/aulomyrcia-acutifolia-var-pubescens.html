                    <h1>Aulomyrcia acutifolia var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Aulomyrcia acutifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy leaf aulomyrcia, is a rare shrub native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered in short, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high levels of shade, typically found at elevations between 1,200 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
