                        <h1>Acaena grahamiana</h1>
<p>Acaena grahamiana, commonly known as the Grahamâ€™s burr, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its spiny, bristly fruits that contain seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acaena grahamiana plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various bird species and contributing to soil stability.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena grahamiana is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury region. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native environment.</p>
<p>Acaena grahamiana plays an important ecological role in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena grahamiana was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of exotic plant species during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in sunny, open habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has limited ecological impact in its introduced range.</p>
