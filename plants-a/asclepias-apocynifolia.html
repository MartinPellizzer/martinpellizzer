                    <h1>Asclepias apocynifolia</h1>
<p>Asclepias apocynifolia, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and oval, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with prominent, hooded buds that open to reveal five petals and a distinctive, heart-shaped structure. Asclepias apocynifolia is a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species.</p>
<p>It contains toxic cardiac glycosides, which deter herbivores and make it an important component of its ecosystem.</p>
