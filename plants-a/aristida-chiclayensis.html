                    <h1>Aristida chiclayensis</h1>
<p>Aristida chiclayensis, commonly known as the Chiclayo grass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass species that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the Pacific coast. The plant has slender, tufted culms and small, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family Poaceae. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its adaptation to coastal ecosystems and potential uses in restoration projects.</p>
