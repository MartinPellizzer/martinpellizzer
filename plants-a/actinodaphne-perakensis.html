                <h1>Actinodaphne perakensis</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne perakensis, commonly known as the Bornean camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and bark. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by dark blue berries. Its wood is valued for its fragrance and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor.</p>
<p>The tree thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne perakensis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, blooming from July to September, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, smooth, yellowish drupe that disperses primarily by gravity and animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne perakensis is primarily native to the Indonesian archipelago, including the islands of Sumatra, Java, and Bali.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded understorey conditions. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is typically associated with moist, fertile soils in primary and secondary forests.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne perakensis is also occasionally found in parts of Malaysia and the Philippines.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne perakensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests and along riverbanks, often growing as an understory plant. The species has been introduced to parts of the Pacific Islands and the Caribbean for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, careful monitoring is needed to prevent ecological disruption in new environments.</p>
