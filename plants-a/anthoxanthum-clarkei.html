<p>Anthoxanthum clarkei, commonly known as Clarke's oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>
