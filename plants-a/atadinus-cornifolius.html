<p>Atadinus cornifolius, commonly known as the hornleaf plant, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Atadinus cornifolius is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
