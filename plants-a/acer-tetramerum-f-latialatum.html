                <h1>Acer tetramerum f. latialatum</h1>
<p>Acer tetramerum f. latialatum, commonly known as the Oregon maple, is a variant of the four-leaf maple native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are typically bronze to reddish in color, especially in the autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest understories.</p>
<p>The foliage and bark of this species are notable for their seasonal changes and aesthetic appeal in horticultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum f. latialatum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5â€“8 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, turning red or orange in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins during early spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum f. latialatum is a rare variant of the red maple, native to the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America, specifically in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in Georgia and South Carolina. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils within mixed hardwood forests, often near streams or in coves. This species typically grows at elevations between 300 and 600 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum f. latialatum is a unique variation of the maple tree known for its striking foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 10 to 15 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be done sparingly in early spring, and pruning is best performed during the dormant season to maintain shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or fungal infections, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other shade-tolerant plants like ferns or hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum f. latialatum is a unique variant of the maple tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other native species. It also contributes to erosion control due to its extensive root system, which helps bind the soil together.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in nutrient cycling by shedding leaves that enrich the forest floor with organic matter.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum f. latialatum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>It has been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though research is still in early stages. Its wood, while not widely used industrially, may have niche applications in crafts or small-scale furniture making. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in certain regions, representing resilience and adaptability due to its ability to thrive in marginal environments.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications remain largely underexplored, with more study needed to fully understand its potential roles.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum f. latialatum has several popular cultivars that are prized for their unique foliage and ornamental value, including 'Erythrophylla' and 'Variegatum'.</p>
<p>These cultivars often exhibit striking variegation or vibrant autumn colors, making them stand out in gardens. Hybrids of this form have been developed to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and leaf coloration, contributing to its popularity in horticulture. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to add visual interest to landscapes with its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>It is widely used in cultivated settings for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
