                    <h1>Agave × ajoensis</h1>
<p>Agave × ajoensis, commonly known as the Ajoñense agave, is a hybrid plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces tall, spire-like flower stalks that bear clusters of yellow-green flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. Its succulent leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber.</p>
<p>Agave × ajoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in low-water conditions.</p>
