                        <h1>Acacia durandiana</h1>
<p>Acacia durandiana, commonly known as the Indian acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and yellow or golden-green flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. Its pods contain seeds that are used in traditional medicine and as a source of food for wildlife.</p>
<p>The plant also plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia durandiana is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, including countries such as India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in dry and semi-arid areas. This species thrives in open woodlands, scrublands, and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its unique, spherical seed pods and is a characteristic feature of the local flora in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia durandiana was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia where it serves as both a valuable resource and an invasive species. The plant's introduction has led to ecological concerns in some areas, as it can outcompete native vegetation. It is often used for its timber, fuelwood, and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, its spread requires careful management to prevent environmental degradation.</p>
