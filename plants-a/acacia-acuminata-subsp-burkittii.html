<p>Acacia acuminata subsp.</p>
<p>burkittii, commonly known as the Burkitt's wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spindly growth habit and phyllodes that are typically linear to narrowly elliptic.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical spikes, which appear in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are reduced to phyllodes, a feature common in many Acacia species, and it is adapted to dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance.</p>
