                <h1>Acosta resupinata</h1>
<p>Acosta resupinata, commonly known as the creeping acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or arid environments. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hair.</p>
<p>Acosta resupinata is known for its resilience to harsh climates and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta resupinata has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows prostrate along the ground. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, with five petals, and bloom in early spring; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta resupinata is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland regions, growing in sandy or rocky soils. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often seen in open habitats such as dunes, grasslands, and coastal bluffs. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Acosta resupinata is an important species in its native range, contributing to local biodiversity and ecosystem stability.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta resupinata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and gravelly slopes.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to a variety of landscapes. This plant is often found in regions with temperate to warm climates, where it can establish itself quickly. Its introduction has been noted in several parts of the United States, particularly in the western states.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its preference for specific soil conditions and climate.</p>
