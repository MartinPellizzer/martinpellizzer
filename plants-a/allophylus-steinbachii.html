<p>Allophylus steinbachii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Allophylus steinbachii is valued for its dense, aromatic wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and carving.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
