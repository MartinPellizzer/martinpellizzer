                <h1>Acrostichum rivulare</h1>
<p>Acrostichum rivulare, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as marshes, swamps, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, slender fronds that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in the water. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum rivulare plays an important role in stabilizing water ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rivulare has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody with a smooth, pale green bark, and grows in a climbing or trailing manner. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, blooming during the spring and summer months, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant, often growing in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rivulare is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed or secondary growth areas due to its ability to colonize open spaces quickly. It is also present in some parts of Oceania, particularly in Papua New Guinea and nearby islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to humid climates with high rainfall and warm temperatures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rivulare was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed sandy soils and along the edges of freshwater wetlands. This plant is often associated with human activities such as land clearing and urban development. It has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its spread is facilitated by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its rapid growth rate.</p>
