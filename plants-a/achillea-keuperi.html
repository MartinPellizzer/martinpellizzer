                <h1>Achillea keuperi</h1>
<p>Achillea keuperi, commonly known as Keuper's yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat, clustered inflorescences of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea keuperi has basal leaves that are lanceolate, gray-green in color, and have a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, covered with a rough, reddish-brown bark, and grows from the base of the plant. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and deep, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea keuperi is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands, specifically found on the islands of Tenerife and La Gomera.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed primarily in these two islands, though its presence has been documented in only a few specific locations. This plant thrives in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas, often growing in well-drained soils. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population, Achillea keuperi is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this rare species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea keuperi is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and vibrant yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the roots in early spring. The growth cycle of Achillea keuperi begins in early spring with new growth, followed by flowering in late summer, and it enters a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize it with a balanced fertilizer in early spring, and prune dead foliage after flowering to promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea keuperi is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering both food and shelter. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its dense growth helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in rocky or sandy areas.</p>
<p>Achillea keuperi also contributes to biodiversity by creating a habitat for various organisms in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea keuperi is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean, known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscaping.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it has been historically explored for its potential medicinal properties, including possible anti-inflammatory and antiseptic effects. Its role in industrial and economic contexts is limited, though its ornamental use contributes to the horticultural industry. Culturally, it shares similarities with other plants in the Asteraceae family, though it does not hold significant symbolic meaning in most traditions.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary applications remain in horticulture and potential medicinal research.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea keuperi has several popular cultivars such as 'Aurea' and 'Purpurea', which are prized for their striking foliage and floral display.</p>
<p>These cultivars often exhibit variations in leaf color, such as gold or silver, and flower hues ranging from white to pink. Hybrids of Achillea keuperi are less common than those of other yarrow species, but some horticultural crosses have been developed to enhance hardiness and bloom performance. Due to its ornamental value, Achillea keuperi is considered important in garden design, particularly in rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to various climates makes it a valuable addition to horticultural collections.</p>
