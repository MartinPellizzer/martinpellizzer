<p>Aspidium conterminum var. delicatulum, commonly known as the delicate water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in water gardens and bog landscapes.</p>
