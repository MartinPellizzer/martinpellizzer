                <h1>Actaea tracyi</h1>
<p>Actaea tracyi, commonly known as Tracy's bugbane, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear large, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its foliage consists of compound leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Actaea tracyi is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea tracyi has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are doubly pinnate with lanceolate to ovate leaflets, varying in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, and displaying a dark green color with a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are white to pale pink, clustered in cymes, with five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, blooming in early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry containing 20â€“30 small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea tracyi is primarily native to the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is found in regions spanning from Pennsylvania to Georgia. This species typically grows in moist, wooded areas with rich, well-drained soil. It is commonly associated with mixed hardwood forests and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Actaea tracyi is a rare and endangered plant, with limited populations across its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea tracyi was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 2000s as an ornamental plant in garden centers and private collections. The introduction is believed to have occurred through horticultural trade rather than natural dispersal. It has since been found in several counties in Washington and Oregon.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact and potential for naturalization remain under study.</p>
