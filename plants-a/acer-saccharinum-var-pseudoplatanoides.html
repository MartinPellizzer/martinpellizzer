<p>Acer saccharinum var. pseudoplatanoides, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its distinctive, slender, pendulous samaras that resemble small keys. The tree typically grows to a height of 20â€“30 meters, with a spreading crown and smooth, gray bark. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and urban landscapes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for ornamental planting, though it is susceptible to pests and diseases.</p>
