<p>Aristida minutiflora var. glabriflora, commonly known as the glabrous false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf hairs compared to the typical form, giving it a smoother appearance.</p>
