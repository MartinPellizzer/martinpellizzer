<p>Arabidopsis stewartiana, commonly known as Stewart's mustard, is a species of flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small annual herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. It is native to regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>Due to its short life cycle and genetic simplicity, it is sometimes used in ecological studies and as a model organism for certain research purposes.</p>
