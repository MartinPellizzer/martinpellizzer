                <h1>Acinodendron cyanocarpum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron cyanocarpum, commonly known as the blue-fruited acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green. Its fruits are small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but may serve as a food source for certain birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron cyanocarpum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a small, blue-black drupe that splits open to release smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron cyanocarpum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in regions with well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and is known for its distinctive blue-black fruits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become increasingly restricted in recent years.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron cyanocarpum was mainly introduced to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It was primarily introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue fruit and unique foliage. The distribution has expanded to parts of Oceania and the Caribbean, where it has been cultivated in gardens and botanical collections. However, it has also become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its spread is largely attributed to human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
