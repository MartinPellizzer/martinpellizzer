                <h1>Acrolasia squalida</h1>
<p>Acrolasia squalida, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant thrives in moist, swampy environments and has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Acrolasia squalida is also valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolasia squalida has simple, alternate, elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its small, white flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia squalida is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these dense forest ecosystems. The plant is commonly found in lowland and hill forest regions, often growing near the forest floor or on rocky outcrops. It plays an important role in the local biodiversity and is adapted to the high rainfall and warm climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia squalida was mainly introduced to coastal and estuarine environments in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish water conditions, often found in mangrove forests and tidal flats. The plant's introduction has been linked to human activities such as coastal development and the spread of aquatic plants for ornamental or agricultural purposes. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in new habitats, sometimes outcompeting native species.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains a subject of ongoing research and monitoring.</p>
