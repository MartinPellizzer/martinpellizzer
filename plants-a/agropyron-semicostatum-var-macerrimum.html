                    <h1>Agropyron semicostatum var. macerrimum</h1>
<p>Agropyron semicostatum var. macerrimum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to poor soils and can often be found in desert grasslands and along rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion and makes it an important component of native plant communities.</p>
