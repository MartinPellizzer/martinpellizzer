                <h1>Adenolisianthus arboreus</h1>
<p>Adenolisianthus arboreus, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a striking tropical tree native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy red flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant has a robust, upright trunk and can grow up to 20 meters in height, making it a prominent feature in its natural habitat. Its leaves are compound, with long, slender leaflets that give it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenolisianthus arboreus has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops fissures as the plant matures.
