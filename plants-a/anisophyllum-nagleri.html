<p>Anisophyllum nagleri, commonly known as the desert shield-fern, is a unique member of the Pteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, delicate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Anisophyllum nagleri is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
