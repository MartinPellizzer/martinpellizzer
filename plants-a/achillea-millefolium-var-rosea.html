                <h1>Achillea millefolium var. rosea</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. rosea, commonly known as the pink yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, showy pink or pale pink flowers. The plant is known for its aromatic foliage and is often used in herbal remedies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its historical association with the mythical hero Achilles.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. rosea has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are narrow, linear, and arranged in a basal rosette, with a silvery-gray underside and a light green upper surface.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a丛生 pattern. The flowers are flat, composite flower heads composed of numerous small white to pinkish florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. rosea is a variant of the common yarrow, native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly the Pyrenees and Alps.</p>
<p>It is now found in parts of Europe, including the British Isles, and has been introduced to some areas of North America. This plant thrives in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes, often in well-drained soils. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>The conservation status of this variant is generally stable, though it may be locally rare due to habitat loss and fragmentation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. rosea is a vibrant perennial known for its pinkish-red flowers and feathery foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing established clumps in early spring or fall. This plant has a typical herbaceous growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and dying back in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune faded flowers to encourage rebloom. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow enhances its beauty and benefits from their shared preferences for full sun and dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. rosea is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its vibrant flowers attract a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, contributing to biodiversity in local ecosystems. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by attracting beneficial insects. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>This plant also plays a role in improving soil health by supporting microbial activity and nutrient cycling.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. rosea is a decorative and ornamental plant commonly used in gardens for its attractive, pinkish-white flowers that add visual interest to landscapes.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its essential oils have been explored for their potential medicinal properties, such as anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. In industrial contexts, it may be used in the production of perfumes or natural dyes due to its aromatic compounds.

<p>These cultivars are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. Hybrids involving this variety are less common, but some horticulturalists have bred it with other Achillea species to enhance flower color and disease resistance. Its horticultural importance lies in its adaptability and long-lasting blooms, making it a popular choice for borders and rock gardens.</p>
<p>Overall, it contributes significantly to the diversity of the achillea genus in landscaping and floral design.</p>
