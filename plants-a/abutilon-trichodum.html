<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon trichodum has ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they can reach up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a rough, fibrous bark that is typically brown or reddish-brown, and it grows upright with some branching. The flowers are pendulous, with five petals that are pale yellow to orange in color, blooming in spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
