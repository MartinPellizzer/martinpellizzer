<p>Alismorkis natalensis, commonly known as Natal water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with some floating on the water surface. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Alismorkis natalensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
