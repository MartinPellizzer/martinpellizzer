<p>Abies pinsapo subsp.</p>
<p>tazaotana, commonly known as the Tazaotan fir, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the mountainous regions of northern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly twisted.</p>
<p>The cones are typically small and have a rounded or elongated shape, with persistent bracts. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often in rocky or limestone soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
