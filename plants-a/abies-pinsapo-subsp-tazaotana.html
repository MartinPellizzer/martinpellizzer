                        <h1>Abies pinsapo subsp. tazaotana</h1>
<p>Abies pinsapo subsp.</p>
<p>tazaotana, commonly known as the Tazaotan fir, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the mountainous regions of northern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly twisted.</p>
<p>The cones are typically small and have a rounded or elongated shape, with persistent bracts. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often in rocky or limestone soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies pinsapo subsp.</p>
<p>tazaotana is primarily native to the mountainous regions of North Africa, specifically spanning parts of Morocco and Algeria. This subspecies is found in the Hercynian massif and the surrounding areas, which are characterized by their high altitudes and unique microclimates.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in association with other endemic flora of the region. The plant is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat, including cold temperatures and limited precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies pinsapo subsp.</p>
<p>tazaotana was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with sufficient elevation to support its growth.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to the Iberian Peninsula and has been introduced to other parts of southern Europe for ornamental and reforestation purposes. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological impacts due to its adaptability and competitive nature.</p>
<p>However, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
