                <h1>Acronychia pauciflora</h1>
<p>Acronychia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered acronychia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves that are usually leathery and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by woody, oblong capsules containing numerous seeds. Acronychia pauciflora is often found in rainforest or semi-evergreen forest habitats, growing on rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia pauciflora has simple, alternate, elliptic or ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a leathery texture and a smooth margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and often has a smooth, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green, with five petals and stamens, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia pauciflora is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the subtropical and tropical regions of eastern Australia. This species typically grows in rainforests and moist, shaded areas. It is often associated with the understorey of these forests.</p>
<p>Acronychia pauciflora is an important part of the native flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia pauciflora was mainly introduced to urban and suburban areas in South East Queensland, Australia, as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. The plant is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>However, its spread is often limited by its preference for specific climatic conditions.</p>
