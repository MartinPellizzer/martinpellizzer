                <h1>Adiantum dolabriforme</h1>
<p>Adiantum dolabriforme, commonly known as the sickle fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or pendulous. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Adiantum dolabriforme is valued for its ornamental appearance and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum dolabriforme has fern-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure 10â€“20 cm in length, with a delicate, dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and creeping, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows along the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, with a simple structure and greenish color, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means, aiding in their dispersal.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it to anchor and spread across moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum dolabriforme is primarily native to Southeast Asia, specifically regions such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded forest environments. This fern is commonly associated with mountainous areas and is frequently encountered in the Western Ghats of India. It prefers well-drained soil and is often seen growing on rocky outcrops or in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats, making it a rare and localized species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum dolabriforme was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there through human activity, possibly as a horticultural plant. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads rapidly along stream banks and forest floors. Its introduction has led to competition with native flora, threatening local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on the ecosystem.</p>
