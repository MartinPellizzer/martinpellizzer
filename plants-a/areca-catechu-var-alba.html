<p>Areca catechu var. alba, commonly known as the white areca palm, is a variant of the areca palm native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost white leaf sheaths, which distinguish it from the more commonly seen green varieties. The plant typically grows as a single trunk with a crown of pinnate leaves, and it can reach heights of up to 10 meters. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The fruit, which is smaller than the standard areca nut, is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber.</p>
