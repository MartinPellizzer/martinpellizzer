<p>Achras zapota var. major, commonly known as the chicle tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and produces a fleshy, edible fruit similar to a fig. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland areas with well-drained soil. Its bark and latex have been historically used for chewing gum and other traditional purposes.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras zapota var. major has large, simple, palmate leaves that are typically 30-50 cm in diameter, with five to seven lobes, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spiny, spherical capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant and absorbing water and nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
