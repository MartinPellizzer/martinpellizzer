<p>Achras zapota var. major, commonly known as the chicle tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves and produces a heavy, fleshy fruit with a yellow or orange exterior. The fruit contains a central cavity filled with a sticky, latex-like substance called chicle, which was historically used in the production of chewing gum. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both its fruit and timber.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role in traditional medicine and as a source of natural rubber-like material.</p>
