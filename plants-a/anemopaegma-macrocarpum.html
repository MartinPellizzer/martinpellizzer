<p>Anemopaegma macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited anemopaegma, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale yellow, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp, which splits into two one-seeded parts upon maturity.</p>
