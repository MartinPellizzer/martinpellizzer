<p>Arthropteris cameroonensis, commonly known as the Cameroon fern, is a species of fern native to Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, brownish layer of rhizomorphs, which help in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Arthropteris cameroonensis plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
