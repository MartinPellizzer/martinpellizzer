<p>Achimenes patens var. major, commonly known as the giant velvetleaf, is a tropical perennial plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to bloom throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>Its foliage and flowers are also used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes patens var. major has heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem and measure approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its flowers are tubular with five petals, typically in shades of pink or red, blooming from summer to autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant to store nutrients and survive periods of drought.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes patens var. major is a tropical plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of southern Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in parts of the Caribbean, including the Bahamas and Cuba, as well as in some tropical regions of South America. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, moist soil, typically found in lowland tropical forests. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 600 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered a species of concern and may be at risk of local extinction in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
