<p>Aspidium artinexum, commonly known as the broad holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that are typically divided into broad, lance-shaped segments. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori.</p>
