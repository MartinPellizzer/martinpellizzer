                    <h1>Atraphaxis spinosa var. sinaica</h1>
<p>Atraphaxis spinosa var. sinaica, commonly known as the Sinai spiny atractylis, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted for water storage. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions.</p>
