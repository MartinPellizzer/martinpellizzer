                    <h1>Adhatoda bojeriana</h1>
<p>Adhatoda bojeriana, commonly known as the rose of Jericho, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant has a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions by curling into a compact, desiccated form. When water becomes available, it rapidly rehydrates and regrows, making it a symbol of resilience.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties.</p>
