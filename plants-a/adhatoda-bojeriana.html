                <h1>Adhatoda bojeriana</h1>
<p>Adhatoda bojeriana, commonly known as the rose of Jericho, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant has a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions by curling into a compact, desiccated form. When water becomes available, it rapidly rehydrates and regrows, making it a symbol of resilience.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda bojeriana has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with blue to violet petals and yellow stamens, blooming from spring to summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda bojeriana is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often used in traditional medicine for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends to regions with a warm and humid climate, where it grows as a climbing plant.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda bojeriana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in countries such as India, China, and parts of Africa for both traditional medicine and horticultural purposes. The plant thrives in humid climates and is often found in gardens and along riverbanks. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, where it can become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, care must be taken to prevent its spread into native ecosystems.</p>
