<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum × stoerkianum var. bicolor is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in areas of Kazakhstan and southern Siberia.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including temperate regions of Europe and North America, where it is cultivated in gardens. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments, often found in forested areas or along stream banks. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters, where the cooler climate suits its growth habits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and the threats from habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum × stoerkianum var. bicolor is a striking perennial known for its vibrant, bi-colored flowers and robust growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of rhizomes, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This plant has a cool season growth cycle, thriving in spring and early summer, with a dormant period in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, moist soil and regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning dead foliage in late fall helps maintain its form. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
