                    <h1>Aegilops comosa var. biaristata</h1>
<p>Aegilops comosa var. biaristata, commonly known as the hairy wild wheat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces spikelets with awns, which are bristle-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for potential use in crop improvement.</p>
