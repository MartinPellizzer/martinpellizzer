                <h1>Achillea lanulosa subsp. typica</h1>
<p>Achillea lanulosa subsp.</p>
<p>typica, commonly known as the woolly yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, woolly appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been historically utilized in traditional herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa subsp.</p>
<p>typica has basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear, with a hairy surface, arranged in a rosette, and typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a gray-green color. The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark, and grows in a branching pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, with ray florets and disc florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa subsp.</p>
<p>typica is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and northern Africa. Its current distribution includes parts of Spain, southern France, and the coastal areas of North Africa.</p>
<p>This species thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and coastal dunes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable, though its conservation status may vary by region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa subsp.</p>
<p>typica is a hardy perennial plant known for its fluffy, yellow flower heads and drought-tolerant nature. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late summer to early fall.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, though it benefits from occasional deep watering during dry periods. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa subsp.</p>
<p>typica is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It attracts a range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its ability to deter pests. Additionally, its dense growth habit helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>This species also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health through its root system.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa subsp.</p>
<p>typica is a flowering plant known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies to treat digestive issues and skin conditions. It has also been utilized in culinary applications, with its leaves and flowers sometimes incorporated into local dishes for their subtle flavor.</p>
<p>Industrially, it contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitats, supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, representing resilience and healing.</p>
<p>However, its specific economic applications are limited, as it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa subsp.</p>
<p>typica has several popular cultivars such as 'Avalanche', 'Moonshine', and 'Silver Queen', which are prized for their compact growth and silvery foliage. These cultivars are often used in rock gardens and as border plants due to their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Hybrids of this subspecies are less common but can be found in horticultural collections that aim to enhance flower color or hardiness. The subspecies is of horticultural importance for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Its low maintenance and drought tolerance make it a favored choice for landscaping in Mediterranean climates.</p>
