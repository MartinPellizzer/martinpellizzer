                    <h1>Agave mitis var. albicans</h1>
<p>Agave mitis var. albicans, commonly known as the white agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the blue agave, which is used in the production of tequila.</p>
