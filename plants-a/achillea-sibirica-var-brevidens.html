<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sibirica var. brevidens has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat woody at the base, with a grayish-brown bark and a growth pattern that is clump-forming. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sibirica var. brevidens is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and southern Siberia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution extends to temperate regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathian Mountains, where it has been introduced. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands, alpine meadows, and forest edges. It typically grows at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its limited natural range and habitat specificity make it a species of conservation concern in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea sibirica var. brevidens is a hardy perennial known for its compact growth and silver foliage, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
