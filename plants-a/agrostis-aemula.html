                    <h1>Agrostis aemula</h1>
<p>Agrostis aemula, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Agrostis aemula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience.</p>
