                <h1>Acidoton obovatus</h1>
<p>Acidoton obovatus, commonly known as the broad-ovate acidoton, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive yellowish-green color.</p>
<p>Acidoton obovatus is often grown for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidoton obovatus has leaves that are obovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidoton obovatus is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within lowland and hill forests. This plant is commonly found in the undergrowth of rainforests, where it benefits from the moist, nutrient-rich soil. It is also occasionally present in parts of southern China and northern Australia.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidoton obovatus was mainly introduced to new environments due to its adaptability and rapid growth rate.</p>
<p>It has been found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban areas. The plant spreads primarily through seeds that are dispersed by wind, water, and human activity. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects for soil stabilization.</p>
