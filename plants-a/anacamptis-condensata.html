                    <h1>Anacamptis condensata</h1>
<p>Anacamptis condensata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, striking spike of violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Anacamptis condensata is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
