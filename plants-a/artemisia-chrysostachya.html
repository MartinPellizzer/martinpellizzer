                    <h1>Artemisia chrysostachya</h1>
<p>Artemisia chrysostachya, commonly known as golden thread, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in dense, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in the summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Artemisia chrysostachya also has historical uses in traditional medicine for its aromatic and antiseptic properties.</p>
