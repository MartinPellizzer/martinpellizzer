<p>Anabasis aphylla subsp.</p>
<p>africana, commonly known as the African sandmat, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, spiny stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically reduced to small scales, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This species is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its resilience in harsh environments.</p>
