                <h1>Achyrophorus incanus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus incanus, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its unique ability to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus incanus has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and somewhat woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips. It produces small, clustered flowers with five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its root system consists of a taproot with lateral branches, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus incanus is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded woodlands and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its range extends from New York to Georgia, and westward into parts of Tennessee and Kentucky.</p>
<p>It is often associated with mixed hardwood forests and is a characteristic species of the eastern deciduous forest ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus incanus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in during the 19th century as part of early agricultural and ornamental plant introductions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has since established itself in forested areas. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its original introduction sites, posing challenges for native ecosystems.</p>
