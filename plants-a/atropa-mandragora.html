                    <h1>Atropa mandragora</h1>
<p>Atropa mandragora, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a poisonous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that produces striking purple or white flowers and dark berries. The plant contains tropane alkaloids, such as atropine and scopolamine, which are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves and berries are particularly harmful, and ingestion can lead to severe poisoning or even death.</p>
<p>Historically, it has been associated with folklore and has been used in traditional medicine, though its use is now largely restricted due to its high toxicity.</p>
