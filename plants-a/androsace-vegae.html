                    <h1>Androsace vegae</h1>
<p>Androsace vegae, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are usually fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Androsace vegae is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
