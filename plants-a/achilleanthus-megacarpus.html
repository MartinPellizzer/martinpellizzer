                <h1>Achilleanthus megacarpus</h1>
<p>Achilleanthus megacarpus, commonly known as the giant achillea, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Achilleanthus megacarpus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its vibrant blooms and hardy nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achilleanthus megacarpus has leaves that are broad, ovate, and slightly hairy, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, rough to the touch, and has a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are showy, with large, bright yellow petals arranged in a clustered inflorescence, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a large, woody capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achilleanthus megacarpus is primarily native to New Guinea, Santa Cruz Is., and Solomon Is.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical regions of these areas, typically in coastal or lowland habitats. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soils. The species is known for its distinctive floral structures and is often found in open woodlands or shrublands.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific island groups in the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achilleanthus megacarpus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. The plant thrives in coastal and disturbed areas, spreading rapidly through its seeds.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread.</p>
