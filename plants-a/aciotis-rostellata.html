                <h1>Aciotis rostellata</h1>
<p>Aciotis rostellata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy purple to pink flower heads.</p>
<p>Aciotis rostellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis rostellata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, with a branching growth pattern that allows it to form dense clumps. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis rostellata is primarily native to South America, specifically in regions of Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands and open habitats within these countries. The plant thrives in temperate to subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed areas and can be found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to the southern part of the continent, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis rostellata was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has since spread to other parts of Europe, particularly in southern regions with mild climates. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various garden environments. However, it has also become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native flora.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds pose challenges for local ecosystems.</p>
