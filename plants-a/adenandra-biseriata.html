                <h1>Adenandra biseriata</h1>
<p>Adenandra biseriata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adenandra, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often fragrant. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Adenandra biseriata is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra biseriata has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. It produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, blooming during the summer months, and is pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra biseriata is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the humid lowland forests. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within the rainforest understory. It is commonly found in areas with rich organic soil and high humidity.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats in Madagascar, making it a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra biseriata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become established in various regions across the country. The plant is primarily found in the North Island, particularly in areas with mild climates and well-drained soils. Its spread has been limited, but it is considered a potential environmental weed in some regions.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to monitor its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
