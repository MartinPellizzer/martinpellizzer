                <h1>Acalypha vermifera</h1>
<p>Acalypha vermifera, commonly known as the threadleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in terminal or axillary inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in three-winged capsules, and the plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas.</p>
<p>Acalypha vermifera is also known for its potential medicinal uses in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha vermifera has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged oppositely along the stem, with a smooth texture and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. It produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with male and female flowers on separate plants, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha vermifera is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to parts of Oceania and the Pacific Islands, where it has been introduced as an ornamental species. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, shaded areas within forests or along stream banks. It is typically found at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its widespread cultivation and naturalization, Acalypha vermifera is not currently listed as endangered, though its conservation status can vary by region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha vermifera is a fast-growing, ornamental shrub known for its vibrant, velvety foliage and unique flowering habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering the quickest and most reliable results. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil, with regular watering during the growing season to maintain moist but not waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>Fertilize it with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring and prune back in late winter to promote bushier growth and shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic appeal.</p>
