                    <h1>Aspalathus angustissima</h1>
<p>Aspalathus angustissima, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and is closely related to other species in the Fabaceae family. The plant is notable for its unique ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, which is a key factor in its ecological adaptation. It produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators, contributing to its role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Aspalathus angustissima is also a source of the popular herbal tea known as rooibos.</p>
