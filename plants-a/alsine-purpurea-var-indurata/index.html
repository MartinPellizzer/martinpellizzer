                            <h1>Alsine Purpurea Var. Indurata</h1>
<p>Alsine purpurea var. indurata is a hardy annual plant commonly found in disturbed soils across North America. It is known for its distinctive purple flowers and hairy stems that help it thrive in harsh environments. This variant of Alsine purpurea is particularly adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, making it a resilient species. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly. Despite its tough appearance, this plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations.</p>
