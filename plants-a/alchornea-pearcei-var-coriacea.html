                    <h1>Alchornea pearcei var. coriacea</h1>
<p>Alchornea pearcei var. coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf alchornea, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruits are small capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental potential and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
