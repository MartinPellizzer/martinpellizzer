<p>Acalypha hederacea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha hederacea is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often seen in forest understories or along stream banks. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
