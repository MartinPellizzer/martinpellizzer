                            <h1>Arachnorchis Stellata</h1>
<p>Star orchid, scientifically known as Arachnorchis stellata, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to the mountainous regions of Australia. Its name is derived from the star-like arrangement of its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter and early spring. This unique plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest floors or rocky crevices. With its intricate floral structure and vibrant colors, it captivates both botanists and nature enthusiasts alike. Due to its limited habitat and threats from environmental changes, the Star orchid is considered a vulnerable species requiring careful conservation efforts.</p>
