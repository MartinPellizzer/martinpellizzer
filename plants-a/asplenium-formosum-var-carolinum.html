                    <h1>Asplenium formosum var. carolinum</h1>
<p>Asplenium formosum var. carolinum, commonly known as the Carolina maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate fern with finely divided, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that resemble the feathers of a bird. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, partially shaded conditions.</p>
