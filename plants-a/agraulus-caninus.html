                    <h1>Agraulus caninus</h1>
<p>Agraulus caninus, commonly known as the dogface butterfly, is a species of skipper butterfly found in various parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hesperiidae and is characterized by its distinctive black and yellow wing patterns. The plant association of Agraulus caninus is primarily with flowering plants, particularly those in the Asteraceae and Fabaceae families, which serve as host plants for its larvae. The butterfly's life cycle involves laying eggs on these host plants, which provide nourishment for the developing caterpillars.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for certain plant communities and its contribution to ecological interactions in its native habitats.</p>
