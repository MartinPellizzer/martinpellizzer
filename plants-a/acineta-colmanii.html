                <h1>Acineta colmanii</h1>
<p>Acineta colmanii, commonly known as the Colman's acineta, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Acineta colmanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acineta colmanii has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta colmanii is primarily native to the southern Andes of South America, including parts of Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level. This plant is adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its native habitat. It is often seen growing in open slopes and among boulders in these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta colmanii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and disturbed urban environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a temperate climate and well-drained soils. This plant thrives in full sun and is often associated with human-altered landscapes. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if left unchecked.</p>
