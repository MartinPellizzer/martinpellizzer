<p>Athyrium physosorum, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of the common maidenhair fern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sporangia located on the underside of the fertile fronds.</p>
