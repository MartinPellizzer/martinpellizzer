                <h1>Actinodaphne oleifolia</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne oleifolia, commonly known as the oil-leaf laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its aromatic leaves and fruits have been used in traditional medicine and as a spice in some cultures.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne oleifolia has simple, elliptic to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exudes a fragrant resin when cut. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from January to April, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through birds and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne oleifolia is primarily native to Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of the Malay Peninsula. This plant thrives in humid and warm climates with well-drained soil. It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Malaysia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne oleifolia was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm, humid climates where it thrives in shaded to semi-shaded conditions. The plant is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections due to its attractive foliage and fragrant leaves. Its introduction has also been associated with efforts to promote biodiversity in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
<p>However, its spread in non-native regions requires careful management to prevent potential ecological impacts.</p>
