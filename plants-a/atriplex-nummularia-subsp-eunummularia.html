<p>Atriplex nummularia subsp.</p>
<p>eunummularia, commonly known as silverleaf chenopod, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, silver-gray, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, reflective hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in compact clusters, typical of the Chenopodiaceae family. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a common species in desert and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its succulent leaves and drought tolerance make it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
