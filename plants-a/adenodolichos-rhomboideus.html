                <h1>Adenodolichos rhomboideus</h1>
<p>Adenodolichos rhomboideus, commonly known as the broad-leafed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with oval to rhomboidal leaflets, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Adenodolichos rhomboideus is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos rhomboideus has alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are rhomboid in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, varying in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, hairy, and have a pale green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-white, and clustered in racemes, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, aiding in nutrient absorption and storage.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos rhomboideus is primarily native to Angola, DR Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in open woodlands and savannas with well-drained soils. The plant is adapted to the seasonal rainfall patterns of its native habitat.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos rhomboideus was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is native to South America but has been introduced to several regions for its ecological benefits. However, its invasive potential has raised concerns in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its utility, careful management is required to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
