<p>Allocarya cusickii var. debilis, commonly known as the weakleaf lomatia, is a rare and delicate shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
