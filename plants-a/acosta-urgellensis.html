                <h1>Acosta urgellensis</h1>
<p>Acosta urgellensis, commonly known as the Urgellensis acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are often yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta urgellensis has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the spring season and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in rocky or arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta urgellensis is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in Ecuador and northern Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in cloud forests and humid montane environments at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters. This species thrives in areas with high rainfall and moderate temperatures, often growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. It is an important part of the local ecosystem and has been used traditionally by indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, its distribution is becoming increasingly restricted.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta urgellensis was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to mild climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses across southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Italy. Although it is not native to these areas, it has been widely cultivated for its aesthetic value. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for a variety of garden settings.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain local ecosystems.</p>
