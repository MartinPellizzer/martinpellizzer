                <h1>Adeloda serrata</h1>
<p>Adeloda serrata, commonly known as the serrated adeloba, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small white flowers. The plant has pinnate leaves with serrated edges, giving it its common name. It produces small, round berries that are typically green when mature.</p>
<p>Adeloda serrata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adeloda serrata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, exhibiting a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is grey to brown in color, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adeloda serrata is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in states such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as parts of Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico. This plant thrives in rocky soils and is often seen in desert scrub and grassland habitats. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Adeloda serrata plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adeloda serrata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native plants in various ecosystems. Its rapid spread has led to concerns about biodiversity loss and habitat disruption.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its distribution and mitigate its environmental impact.</p>
