                        <h1>Acanthus boissieri</h1>
<p>Acanthus boissieri, commonly known as the rock acanthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces spiky, spathaceous flower clusters in late summer, which are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Acanthus boissieri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and architectural form.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthus boissieri is primarily native to Greece.</p>
<p>It is found in the Mediterranean region, particularly in the mountainous areas of the country. This plant thrives in rocky and dry habitats, often growing on cliffs or in limestone soils. It is a hardy species that is well adapted to the climatic conditions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>Its native range is largely confined to specific regions within Greece.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthus boissieri was mainly introduced to areas with Mediterranean climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as California, Oregon, and parts of Australia. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and flower spikes. However, it can become invasive in some environments if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems in non-native regions.</p>
