                <h1>Aegiphila lhotzkiana</h1>
<p>Aegiphila lhotzkiana, commonly known as the Lhotzky's aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in whorls, producing a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila lhotzkiana has leaves that are narrow and lanceolate, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, woody, and has a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the rocky, arid environments where the plant typically grows.</p>
