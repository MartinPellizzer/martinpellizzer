                <h1>Aegilops bicornis</h1>
<p>Aegilops bicornis, commonly known as the two-awned goatgrass, is a wild annual grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two awns on each lemma, giving it its common name. Aegilops bicornis is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, temperate climates.</p>
<p>It has been studied for its potential in agricultural research due to its genetic relationship with wheat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops bicornis has narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat, parallel-veined, and typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown color, growing upright and branching sparingly. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish-white florets, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled caryopsis, with seeds dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>
