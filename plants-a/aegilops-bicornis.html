<p>Aegilops bicornis, commonly known as the two-awned goatgrass, is a wild annual grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two awns on each lemma, giving it its common name. Aegilops bicornis is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, temperate climates.</p>
<p>It has been studied for its potential in agricultural research due to its genetic relationship with wheat.</p>
