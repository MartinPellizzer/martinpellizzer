<p>Aloe arachnoides var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or woolly aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The leaves are typically shorter and broader than those of other aloe species, and they often curl under during drought conditions. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers on slender stems during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
