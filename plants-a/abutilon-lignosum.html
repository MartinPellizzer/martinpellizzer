                <h1>Abutilon lignosum</h1>
<p>Abutilon lignosum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Chinese lantern plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fuzzy, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive velvety appearance. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from orange to red, often resembling small lanterns. It is a deciduous species, shedding its leaves during dry seasons, and thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>Abutilon lignosum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and vibrant floral displays.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon lignosum has alternate, ovate to heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface and a dull green color on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>Its stems are woody and branched, with a rough, bark-like texture that is usually brown or reddish-brown, and they grow in a shrub-like manner. The flowers are cup-shaped with five petals, typically yellow or orange in color, and bloom from summer to autumn; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon lignosum is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, forests, and riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to about 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Abutilon lignosum is considered a non-native invasive species in many areas, and its conservation status varies depending on the region, with some populations facing threats from habitat loss and competition with native flora.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon lignosum is a fast-growing, shrub-like plant known for its velvety foliage and showy flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method. It thrives in warm climates with a growth cycle that includes active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it requires well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize during the growing season with a balanced fertilizer, and prune to maintain shape and encourage flowering. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like root rot can occur if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
