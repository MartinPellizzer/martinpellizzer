                <h1>Acer neglectum</h1>
<p>Acer neglectum, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer neglectum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod, which disperses by wind, allowing the seeds to travel several meters from the parent plant.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer neglectum is a deciduous tree native to China, specifically found in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to scattered populations in mountainous regions of southern China. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate forests and mountain valleys. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer neglectum is classified as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer neglectum is a small deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and easy maintenance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The growth cycle of Acer neglectum is relatively slow, with new growth appearing in spring and leaves turning vibrant colors in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in early spring, and pruning is best done in late winter to shape the tree and remove any dead branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigold can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer neglectum is a versatile plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through improved soil conditions. Its extensive root system helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer neglectum offers ecological benefits by supporting a diverse range of insects and animals in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer neglectum is a small, ornamental tree known for its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and early spring blooms, making it a popular choice in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves can be occasionally used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Industrially, it contributes to local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for wildlife.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic value in some regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer neglectum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Katherine Storey' and 'Variegatum', known for their striking foliage colors and compact growth. Hybrids of Acer neglectum are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and fall color. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>They are commonly used in shade gardens and as specimen plants.</p>
