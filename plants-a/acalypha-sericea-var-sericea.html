                    <h1>Acalypha sericea var. sericea</h1>
<p>Acalypha sericea var. sericea, commonly known as velvetleaf or silky ironweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features palmate leaves with a soft, velvety texture due to the dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an aggressive weed in many habitats.</p>
