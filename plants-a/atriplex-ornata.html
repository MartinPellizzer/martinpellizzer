                    <h1>Atriplex ornata</h1>
<p>Atriplex ornata, commonly known as the silverleaf chenopod, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Atriplex ornata is a halophyte, meaning it can tolerate high salt concentrations, making it adapted to saline soils.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing food and habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
