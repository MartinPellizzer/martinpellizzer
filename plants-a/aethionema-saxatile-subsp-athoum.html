<p>Aethionema saxatile subsp.</p>
<p>athoum, commonly known as the Armenian rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
