                        <h1>Aalius quadrangularis</h1>
<p>Aalius quadrangularis, commonly known as the four-sided plant, is a unique species characterized by its quadrangular stems.</p>
<p>The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The species is native to arid regions and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure makes it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Aalius quadrangularis belongs to the kingdom Plantae, phylum Magnoliophyta, class Equisetopsida, subclass Equisetidae, order Equisetales, family Equisetaceae, genus Aalius, and species quadrangularis.</p>
<p>This plant is a type of horsetail, characterized by its jointed stems and spore-producing structures. It is commonly found in wet, marshy environments where it thrives in moist soil conditions. Aalius quadrangularis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>Its classification reflects its evolutionary relationship to other vascular plants within the Equisetopsida class.</p>
