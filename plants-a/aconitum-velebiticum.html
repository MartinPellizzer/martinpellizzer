                <h1>Aconitum velebiticum</h1>
<p>Aconitum velebiticum, commonly known as the Velebit monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its leaves are palmately compound, with a distinctive palmate structure and serrated edges.</p>
<p>Aconitum velebiticum contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum velebiticum has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is upright, smooth, and often tinged with purple at the base. The flowers are showy, blue to violet in color, with spurred petals and a complex structure that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies, typically blooming in late summer. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving in cooler, moist environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum velebiticum is primarily native to the Dinaric Mountains, specifically in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude regions, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. This plant thrives in moist, shaded areas and is typically associated with mountainous terrain. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum velebiticum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in woodland or along streambanks.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with cool summers and cold winters. The plant is known for its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It is commonly used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it is toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
