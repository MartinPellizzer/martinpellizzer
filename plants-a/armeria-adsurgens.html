The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Armeria adsurgens is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal gardens.</p>
