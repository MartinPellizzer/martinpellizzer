The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
