                <h1>Adenanthera ossea</h1>
<p>Adenanthera ossea, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and distinctive pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers. Its root system is deep and robust, enabling it to thrive in arid and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthera ossea has compound, bipinnate leaves that are trifoliate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern, typically green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is woody and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale bark that exudes a milky sap when damaged. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with yellow petals and a prominent central stamen, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a flat, leathery pod that splits open to release small, smooth seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are extensive and woody, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
