                <h1>Adenanthera ossea</h1>
<p>Adenanthera ossea, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The tree is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in preventing soil erosion.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthera ossea has compound, pinnate leaves that are typically 30-50 cm long, with 10-20 pairs of lanceolate, serrated leaflets arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grey to brown in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are yellow and arranged in racemes, with a tubular corolla and stamens, blooming from October to December, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody pod that splits open to release flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera ossea is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Mozambique, and Madagascar.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in savannas and coastal areas. This plant is also native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and Malaysia. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient species in these environments.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely tied to regions with warm, dry conditions and limited rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera ossea was mainly introduced to South Africa as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, where it thrives in warm, sunny conditions. The plant is also used in erosion control because of its deep root system that stabilizes the soil. However, it has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to manage its spread.</p>
