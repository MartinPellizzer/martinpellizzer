                <h1>Achyranthes mutica</h1>
<p>Achyranthes mutica, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, dry fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes mutica has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets that are usually 2–5 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, exhibiting a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a rough, fibrous bark that is typically brown to reddish in color. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-winged schizocarp, releasing small, smooth seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes mutica is primarily native to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is found in various habitats across the Hawaiian Islands, including forests, wetlands, and disturbed areas. This plant is commonly associated with moist environments and is often seen in lowland and montane regions. It plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for native wildlife.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas outside of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes mutica was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as agriculture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils, including roadsides, fields, and urban areas. This plant has adapted well to a variety of environmental conditions, allowing it to spread rapidly in non-native regions. Its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils gives it a competitive advantage over native flora.</p>
<p>As a result, it is considered an invasive species in several areas where it has been introduced.</p>
