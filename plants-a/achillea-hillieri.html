                <h1>Achillea hillieri</h1>
<p>Achillea hillieri, commonly known as the Stewart's yarrow, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea hillieri has basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, arranged in a rosette, and measure approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, covered in a rough, hairy texture, and has a reddish-brown color, growing from the base of the plant. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green composite blooms arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb moisture.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea hillieri is a flowering plant native to New Zealand, specifically found on the North Island.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few locations, primarily on the Coromandel Peninsula. It thrives in coastal environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. This species is typically found at low altitudes, usually below 300 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea hillieri is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea hillieri is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and vibrant yellow flowers, often used in ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, though it often behaves as a short-lived perennial in colder climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally pest and disease resistant, though it may attract aphids in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea hillieri is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by improving soil conditions. It also contributes to erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea hillieri supports biodiversity by creating microhabitats that sustain various ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea hillieri is a flowering plant native to New Zealand, known for its ornamental value and use in horticulture.</p>
<p>It has limited culinary applications, as its flowers are not commonly used in food preparation. In traditional MƒÅori medicine, it has been used for its purported healing properties, though scientific validation is limited. The plant also plays a role in ecological systems, supporting local pollinators and contributing to biodiversity.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds significance in New Zealand's natural heritage and is often appreciated for its beauty in garden settings.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea hillieri has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Lemoinei' and 'Purpurea', which are known for their vibrant flower colors and compact growth habits. Hybrid forms have been developed to enhance traits such as flower size, color diversity, and disease resistance. These hybrids are often used in garden landscapes for their ability to thrive in a range of conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea hillieri and its cultivars hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and hardiness.</p>
