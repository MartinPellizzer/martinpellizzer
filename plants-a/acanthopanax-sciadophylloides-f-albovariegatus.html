<p>Acanthopanax sciadophylloides f. albovariegatus, commonly known as the white-variegated angel's trumpet, is a variant of the angel's trumpet plant characterized by its striking white and variegated foliage.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer. Its ornamental value is enhanced by the contrast between its variegated leaves and the pale blossoms, making it a popular choice for shaded garden settings.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of cardiac glycosides in its sap and berries.</p>
