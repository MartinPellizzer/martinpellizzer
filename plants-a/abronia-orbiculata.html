                    <h1>Abronia orbiculata</h1>
<p>Abronia orbiculata, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often inflated, resembling bladders, which help it retain moisture in its arid, sandy habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it well-suited for the harsh conditions of coastal ecosystems.</p>
