                        <h1>Abronia orbiculata</h1>
<p>Abronia orbiculata, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often inflated, resembling bladders, which help it retain moisture in its arid, sandy habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it well-suited for the harsh conditions of coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia orbiculata is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of California. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in desert and semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats that provide the necessary conditions for its survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia orbiculata was mainly introduced to the coastal dunes and sandy soils of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. This plant is often found in areas with mild, temperate climates and minimal rainfall. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
