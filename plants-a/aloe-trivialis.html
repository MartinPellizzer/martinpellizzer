                    <h1>Aloe trivialis</h1>
<p>Aloe trivialis, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or lesser aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit and fleshy, pale green leaves that are covered in a thin layer of white powder. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers on slender stems, typically during the warmer months. Aloe trivialis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves to survive periods of drought.</p>
<p>It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions.</p>
