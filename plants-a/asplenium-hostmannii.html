                    <h1>Asplenium hostmannii</h1>
<p>Asplenium hostmannii, commonly known as the Hostmann's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its rhizomes and leaf surfaces. It is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its simple yet elegant structure makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts.</p>
