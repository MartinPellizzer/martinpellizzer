                    <h1>Anathallis racemiflora</h1>
<p>Anathallis racemiflora, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil and thrives on the branches of host trees such as *Inga* and *Cecropia*. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, and it absorbs water and nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>Anathallis racemiflora plays a unique ecological role in its habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of the forest canopy.</p>
