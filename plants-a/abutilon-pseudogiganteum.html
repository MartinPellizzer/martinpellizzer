<p>Abutilon pseudogiganteum, commonly known as the giant velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Abutilon pseudogiganteum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can grow up to several meters in height.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon pseudogiganteum has elongated, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 5–10 cm long and 3–5 cm wide.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a tendency to branch out. The flowers are pendulous, with five lobes, and are typically yellow or orange, blooming during the summer months; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon pseudogiganteum is a plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is now found in cultivation in various parts of the world, including the United States and Europe, though it is not widely naturalized. This species thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. It typically grows at elevations between 3,000 and 4,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of concern and is listed as endangered in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
