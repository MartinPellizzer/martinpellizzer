                    <h1>Aconitum × sturiense</h1>
<p>Aconitum × sturiense, commonly known as the hybrid monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant features palmately compound leaves with a distinctive basal rosette, and its roots are tuberous, which contribute to its hardiness in cold climates. Aconitum × sturiense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic appearance.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
