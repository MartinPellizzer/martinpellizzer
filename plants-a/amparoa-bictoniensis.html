                    <h1>Amparoa bictoniensis</h1>
<p>Amparoa bictoniensis, commonly known as the Bicton Island lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species endemic to the remote Bicton Islands in the Southern Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a symbiotic composite organism composed of a fungus and a green alga, which together form a distinct thallus structure. The plant exhibits a crustose growth form, adhering tightly to rock surfaces in its harsh coastal habitat. It thrives in nutrient-poor, moist environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Amparoa bictoniensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
