                <h1>Acer glaucum</h1>
<p>Acer glaucum, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable species in both ecological and ornamental contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer glaucum has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm in length, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and a pale green to white underside, giving it a bluish appearance.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer glaucum is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, specifically found in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests and along stream banks. This species typically grows at elevations between 600 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Acer glaucum is listed as a species of concern in some regions due to habitat loss and fragmentation, though it is not currently considered endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer glaucum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by transplanting young saplings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer glaucum involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells, but is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications in early spring, and pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant perennials or shrubs is ideal to enhance its ornamental appeal and support ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer glaucum is a native North American tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy white flowers. Its extensive root system acts as an effective erosion control plant, stabilizing soil in stream banks and slopes. The tree also serves as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity by creating microhabitats.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil quality and offering shade that regulates local temperatures.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer glaucum is a deciduous tree native to North America, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its bark and leaves have been historically used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The tree contributes to the economy through timber and landscape horticulture, supporting local industries. Culturally, it is admired for its aesthetic appeal and is often planted in gardens and public spaces.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents resilience and natural beauty, making it a valued species in both environmental and cultural contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer glaucum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Summerglo' and 'Flame', known for their vibrant yellow foliage. Hybrids with other maple species, such as *Acer x maple*, have been developed to enhance color and hardiness. These plants are of significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in landscapes.</p>
<p>They are widely used in gardens and public spaces for their seasonal color and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
