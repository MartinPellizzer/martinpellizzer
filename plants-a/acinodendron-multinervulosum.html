                <h1>Acinodendron multinervulosum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron multinervulosum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Olacaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive milky sap, which is toxic and used in traditional medicine. The plant features compound leaves with multiple veins, and its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique properties, it has both ornamental and medicinal significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron multinervulosum has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a dark green upper surface contrasting with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and exhibit a prominent venation pattern. The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom during the dry season, relying on wind pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron multinervulosum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in the understory where there is ample shade. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and well-drained soils. It is typically associated with secondary growth forests and is sometimes found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron multinervulosum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant has been observed spreading rapidly in invasive manner, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction is often associated with human activities like land clearing and gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it poses a threat to local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
