                <h1>Acritopappus harleyi</h1>
<p>Acritopappus harleyi, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with small, hairy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in desert and semi-desert habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acritopappus harleyi has small, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 1 to 3 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a simple, branching pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green structures arranged in dense clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal, and the seeds are lightweight, allowing them to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acritopappus harleyi is primarily native to Brazil Northeast.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the northeastern region of Brazil, where it thrives in specific ecological conditions. It is commonly associated with rocky and dry habitats in this area. The species is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its unique floral structure.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to this geographic region, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acritopappus harleyi was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, open fields, and along stream banks. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It has been reported in several counties across these regions as an invasive species.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive spread, it poses a threat to native plant communities and ecological balance.</p>
