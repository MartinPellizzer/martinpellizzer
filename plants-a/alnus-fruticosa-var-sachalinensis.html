                    <h1>Alnus fruticosa var. sachalinensis</h1>
<p>Alnus fruticosa var. sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin alder, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, serrated leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across forest edges and disturbed soils. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is an important component of riparian ecosystems.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas.</p>
