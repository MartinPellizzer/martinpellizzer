                    <h1>Asplenium ammifolium</h1>
<p>Asplenium ammifolium, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a fern that thrives in rocky and calcareous environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically clustered around rocks or on the ground. The plant has a simple, non-branching rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It is often found in temperate regions and is well adapted to low-nutrient, dry habitats.</p>
<p>Asplenium ammifolium plays a minor role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for small invertebrates.</p>
