                <h1>Adenopodia scelerata</h1>
<p>Adenopodia scelerata, commonly known as the rough-stemmed adenopodia, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant features slender, branched stems covered in stiff, rough hairs, giving it its common name. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in umbels, a typical feature of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>Adenopodia scelerata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopodia scelerata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stems are woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color, and they grow in a spreading, shrub-like pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopodia scelerata is primarily native to Angola, Benin, Cabinda, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, DR Congo, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Liberia, and Nigeria.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical regions of these countries, typically in forested or wooded areas. It thrives in humid and warm climates, often growing in the undergrowth of dense vegetation. The species is well adapted to the ecological conditions of these regions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its preference for stable, moist environments in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopodia scelerata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread across various regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often colonizing coastal areas and agricultural lands. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental transport via human activity.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential, it has not been classified as a noxious weed in New Zealand.</p>
