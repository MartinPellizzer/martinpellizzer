                    <h1>Alsophila atrovirens var. ciliatopaleacea</h1>
<p>Alsophila atrovirens var. ciliatopaleacea, commonly known as the ciliate-veined tree fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, compound fronds that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The fronds are typically dark green with a leathery texture and exhibit a unique ciliate (bristly) margin along the veins. This variety thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and shaded landscapes.</p>
