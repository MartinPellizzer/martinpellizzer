                    <h1>Anacolosa poilanei</h1>
<p>Anacolosa poilanei, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its roots are often covered in a dense, white mycorrhizal sheath, which aids in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
