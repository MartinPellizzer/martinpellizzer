                <h1>Aconitum alpinum</h1>
<p>Aconitum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers, which are arranged in a helmet-like shape, giving it its common name. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Aconitum alpinum is part of the Ranunculaceae family and contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum alpinum has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, typically green with a slightly hairy underside, and can grow up to 20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, usually reaching 1 to 2 meters in height, with a smooth, dark brown bark that is somewhat woody in texture. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, arranged in dense spikes, and consist of five petals with a spurred lower petal; they bloom in late summer to early autumn and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that develops from the flower, containing several seeds that are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and attached silky hairs.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil in its alpine habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum alpinum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Europe, including the Alps, Carpathians, and Pyrenees.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. This plant is commonly found in meadows, rocky slopes, and forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Aconitum alpinum is also present in parts of Western Asia, such as the Caucasus and Turkey.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum alpinum was mainly introduced to gardens and naturalized areas in temperate regions due to its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to semi-shaded environments. The plant is known for its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It has been introduced to several countries outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
