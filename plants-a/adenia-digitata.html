                <h1>Adenia digitata</h1>
<p>Adenia digitata, commonly known as the African butter tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its woody, tree-like structure with thick, smooth bark. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive, fleshy calyx that resembles a hand, giving it its common name. Its fruit is a large, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Adenia digitata is valued for its ornamental beauty and has traditional uses in some African cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia digitata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, bark that is typically grey to brown in color, and it grows as an upright shrub. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by animals eating the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia digitata is primarily native to Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, KwaZulu-Natal, Malawi, Mozambique, Northern Provinces, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or woodland areas. Adenia digitata is known for its distinctive floral structures and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of southern Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia digitata was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive yellow flowers and unique foliage. The plant has since naturalized in certain areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. It is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest margins and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
