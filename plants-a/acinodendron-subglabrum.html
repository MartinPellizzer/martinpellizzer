                <h1>Acinodendron subglabrum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron subglabrum, commonly known as the smooth acinodendron, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>It is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron subglabrum has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light gray bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron subglabrum is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within lowland and mountainous regions. This species is commonly found in primary and secondary forests where the soil is rich and well-drained. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of these ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron subglabrum was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread through naturalization and human activity. The plant is now considered a potential environmental weed in certain regions of New Zealand. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is tolerant of both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
