<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acianthera marumbyana is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices, demonstrating its adaptability to challenging environments.</p>
