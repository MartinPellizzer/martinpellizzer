                    <h1>Ajuga stoloniflora</h1>
<p>Ajuga stoloniflora, commonly known as carpet bugle or silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, silver-veined leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ground-covering ability.</p>
<p>Ajuga stoloniflora spreads via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
