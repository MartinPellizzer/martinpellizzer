                    <h1>Asplenium saxatile</h1>
<p>Asplenium saxatile, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in rocky and shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on limestone or sandstone surfaces, often in crevices or on cliff faces. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium saxatile is well adapted to humid, nutrient-poor conditions and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
