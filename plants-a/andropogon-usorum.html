<p>Andropogon usorum, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in native grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Andropogon usorum is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience to environmental stress.</p>
