                <h1>Acisanthera tetramera</h1>
<p>Acisanthera tetramera, commonly known as the four-petaled sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, four-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in dry, hot environments. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged oppositely along the stems, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Acisanthera tetramera is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an indicator species of arid and semi-arid habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acisanthera tetramera has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and grows upright with a woody base that has a rough, grayish-brown bark. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with four petals that are pale yellow to white in color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release minute, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera tetramera is primarily native to South America, specifically in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the subtropical and tropical regions of these countries. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and understorey areas. It is often associated with riverine and floodplain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera tetramera was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. The plant's spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain habitats. It is often found in open areas with well-drained soil, contributing to its successful establishment.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its invasive potential requires careful management to prevent ecological impacts.</p>
