<p>Acacia albida, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves that help reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. Its seed pods are elongated and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals or wind.</p>
<p>Acacia albida is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fodder.</p>
