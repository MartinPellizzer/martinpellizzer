                <h1>Adenogyna sarmentosa</h1>
<p>Adenogyna sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping adenogyna, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adenogyna sarmentosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and swampy areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenogyna sarmentosa has simple, opposite, elliptic leaves that are glossy green in color, with a smooth texture and moderate size.</p>
<p>Its stems are slender, twining, and covered with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically pinkish-white in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind after maturity.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogyna sarmentosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in lowland forests and disturbed areas. This plant is commonly associated with wetlands and swampy habitats due to its preference for moist environments. It is also found in some regions of China and Thailand.</p>
<p>Adenogyna sarmentosa is typically a climbing or trailing plant, often seen in the undergrowth of dense vegetation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogyna sarmentosa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas, becoming naturalized in moist, shaded environments. Its establishment has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is now considered a weed in some regions where it has invaded natural habitats.</p>
