                <h1>Acer monspessulanum subsp. cinerascens</h1>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-leaf maple, is a species of maple native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and have a finely toothed margin.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and light grey, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in rocky or limestone soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>cinerascens has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-7 lobes, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its typically moist, acidic soil habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>cinerascens is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in southern Spain and Portugal. While its native range was historically more widespread, its current distribution is restricted to a few isolated populations, primarily in the Sierra de Cazorla and Sierra de Almendralejo regions.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in dry, rocky environments, often growing on limestone soils in open woodlands and scrublands. It is typically found at altitudes between 600 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect this unique species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>cinerascens is a small, slow-growing tree known for its distinctive grayish-brown bark and ornamental value. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this species is relatively slow, with a mature height of around 5â€“8 meters, making it suitable for smaller gardens.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in spring, while pruning is mainly for shaping and removing dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or heather can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>cinerascens is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity and ecological stability. Its deep roots help in erosion control by stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and offers aesthetic value to the landscape.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>cinerascens is a lesser-known maple species with limited culinary use due to its small, bitter fruits. It has been traditionally used in folk medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and astringent properties.</p>
<p>While not widely utilized in industrial applications, its wood is occasionally used for small crafts and decorative items. Culturally, it is appreciated in certain regions for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its symbolic significance is more regional, often representing resilience and natural beauty in local traditions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>cinerascens has several popular cultivars such as 'Atrosanguineum' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their striking bark and foliage. It is also used in hybridization with other maple species to create ornamental varieties with enhanced traits.</p>
<p>These hybrids often display improved cold hardiness and unique leaf patterns, making them valuable in horticulture. The subspecies is particularly important in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its cultivars and hybrids contribute significantly to the diversity of maple trees in landscape design.</p>
