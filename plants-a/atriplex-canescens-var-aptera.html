                    <h1>Atriplex canescens var. aptera</h1>
<p>Atriplex canescens var. aptera, commonly known as silverleaf gooseberry, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, powdery hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to thrive in dry, saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
