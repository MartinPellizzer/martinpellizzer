<p>Aulomyrcia androsaemoides, commonly known as the Andros Island mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Andros Island in the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, red fruits containing one or two seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
