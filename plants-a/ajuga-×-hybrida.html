<p>Ajuga × hybrida, commonly known as carpet bugle or bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Asia and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its dense, spreading foliage that forms a thick mat. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer.
