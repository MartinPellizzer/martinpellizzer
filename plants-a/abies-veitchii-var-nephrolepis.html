<p>Abies veitchii var. nephrolepis, commonly known as the Veitch's fir with nephrolepis foliage, is a rare variant of the Veitch's fir.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, scale-like leaves that resemble those of the nephrolepis fern, giving it a unique appearance. This plant is native to China and is often found in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates. Its conical shape and dense foliage make it a striking ornamental plant.</p>
<p>However, it is relatively uncommon in cultivation due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
