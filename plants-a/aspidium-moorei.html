<p>Aspidium moorei, commonly known as the Moore's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the water's surface. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium moorei plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life.</p>
