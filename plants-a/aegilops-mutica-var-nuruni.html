                    <h1>Aegilops mutica var. nuruni</h1>
<p>Aegilops mutica var. nuruni, commonly known as the naked wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has reduced glumes, giving it a "naked" appearance, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for forage and its genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
