                <h1>Acinos thymoides</h1>
<p>Acinos thymoides, commonly known as mountain thyme, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its aromatic properties.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos thymoides has small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems, and measure about 1â€“2 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are erect and branched, with a rough, hairy texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a low, cushion-like form. The flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals, blooming in early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the rocky, well-drained soils where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos thymoides is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, dry habitats such as slopes, open woodlands, and gravelly soils. This plant is commonly found in the coastal and inland regions of these states. It is adapted to Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.</p>
<p>Acinos thymoides is often seen in areas with low vegetation, growing as a low shrub or perennial herb.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos thymoides was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with full sun and well-drained soils, making it common in semi-arid environments. This plant is often found in the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. Its ability to spread rapidly has led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and use in herbal medicine.</p>
