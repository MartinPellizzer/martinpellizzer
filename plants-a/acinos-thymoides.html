                <h1>Acinos thymoides</h1>
<p>Acinos thymoides, commonly known as mountain thyme or creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, aromatic leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos thymoides has small, gray-green, narrowly elliptic leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette and are typically less than 1 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a rough, hairy texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a low, compact form. Its flowers are small, pinkish-white, and clustered in dense, round heads, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos thymoides is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across the Iberian Peninsula, where it thrives in rocky and gravelly soils. This plant prefers sunny, dry environments and is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat fragmentation and limited distribution, Acinos thymoides is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acinos thymoides is a hardy, aromatic perennial that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing in early spring or by dividing established clumps in the spring or fall. The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity in 2â€“3 years, and it produces small yellow flowers in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods, and benefits from a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like rosemary or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acinos thymoides is a low-growing plant that provides essential food and shelter for various desert wildlife.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a valuable companion plant in arid landscapes, helping to stabilize soil and reduce erosion. Its dense growth also offers protection to smaller plants and animals from harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acinos thymoides contributes to the overall biodiversity and resilience of its ecosystem.</p>
