                <h1>Achillea tenuis</h1>
<p>Achillea tenuis, commonly known as slender yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, upright stems and narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters.</p>
<p>Achillea tenuis is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea tenuis has narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length, with a bluish-gray color and a smooth, slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, upright, and often branching, with a greenish-gray bark that is smooth and slightly rough to the touch. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads composed of many tiny florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tenuis is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of France.</p>
<p>It is also found in the Mediterranean region, extending into North Africa and the Middle East. This plant thrives in rocky and dry environments, often growing on limestone soils. It is commonly found in grasslands, scrublands, and along the edges of forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tenuis was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, finely divided foliage and delicate white flowers.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes, particularly in regions with temperate climates. However, it has also become naturalized in some areas, spreading beyond cultivated gardens into wild habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to outcompete native plant species in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, careful management is recommended to prevent its spread into sensitive ecological areas.</p>
