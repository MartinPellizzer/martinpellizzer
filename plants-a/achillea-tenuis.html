                <h1>Achillea tenuis</h1>
<p>Achillea tenuis, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems and basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Achillea tenuis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea tenuis has narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, arranged in a basal rosette, and measure about 2â€“5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly woody at the base, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. The flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white to pale yellow petals that bloom from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, enabling the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tenuis is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and Algeria, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. It prefers arid or semi-arid environments and is commonly found in open habitats such as scrublands and grasslands. This species typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea tenuis is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea tenuis is a low-growing perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in a well-drained seed starting mix. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune dead foliage after flowering to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea tenuis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including beneficial insects and small mammals, which contribute to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea tenuis offers ecological benefits by supporting pollinator populations and contributing to the overall health of the habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea tenuis is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and traditional uses.</p>
<p>It has been historically used in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. While not widely cultivated for culinary purposes, it may be used in some regional cuisines as a minor herb. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice in garden design and landscaping.</p>
<p>However, its industrial and economic applications are limited, and it holds cultural significance in certain regions as a symbol of resilience and healing.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea tenuis has several popular cultivars that are favored for their ornamental value and hardiness, including 'Aurea' and 'Silver King,' which are known for their finely divided, silvery foliage and long-lasting blooms.</p>
<p>While it is less commonly hybridized compared to other yarrow species, some horticultural hybrids have been developed to enhance traits such as flower color and disease resistance. These cultivars are valued for their ability to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making them suitable for rock gardens and borders. Their low maintenance requirements and extended bloom period contribute to their horticultural importance in landscaping.</p>
<p>Achillea tenuis remains a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant, decorative plants.</p>
