                <h1>Achras nigra</h1>
<p>Achras nigra, commonly known as black palm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers that develop into black, fleshy fruits. The fruits are edible and have a sweet, tropical flavor, often used in local cuisines.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated for its unique aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras nigra has large, simple, palmate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a broad, lobed shape and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is thick, woody, and covered with a rough, dark brown bark that develops deep fissures as the plant matures. It produces large, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a panicle inflorescence, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spiny, globose capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fleshy, edible pulp.</p>
<p>Its roots are extensive and fibrous, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras nigra is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils along the coastline. This plant is commonly associated with the Succulent Karoo biome, where it adapts to the harsh, dry conditions. It is also found in parts of the Kalahari Desert, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, Achras nigra is an important component of the native flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras nigra was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential economic use.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm climates, such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and the Pacific Islands. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and urban landscapes. Its unique black fruit and attractive foliage contribute to its popularity in horticulture.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
