                            <h1>Amylotheca Celebica</h1>
<p>Celebes stagshorn, scientifically known as Amylotheca celebica, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Indonesia. This unique species is named for its distinctive, antler-like spines that adorn its stems, giving it an almost prehistoric appearance. Found primarily in the rainforests of Sulawesi, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich soil. Its striking appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Despite its beauty, the Celebes stagshorn remains poorly studied, highlighting the need for further research and protection.</p>
