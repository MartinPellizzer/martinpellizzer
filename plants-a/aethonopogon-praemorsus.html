<p>Aethonopogon praemorsus, commonly known as the death's-head orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, dark purple flowers that resemble a skull, giving it its ominous common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
