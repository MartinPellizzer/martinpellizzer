<p>Achyrophorus arenarius, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It has a creeping growth habit with densely packed, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. Its root system is extensive and adapted to anchor the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Achyrophorus arenarius is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
