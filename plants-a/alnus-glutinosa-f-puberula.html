<p>Alnus glutinosa f. puberula, commonly known as the sticky alder, is a subspecies of the alder tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are typically male, while female flowers are found on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water bodies.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
