                        <h1>Acacia puncticulata</h1>
<p>Acacia puncticulata, commonly known as the punctuated wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Acacia puncticulata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
