                    <h1>Alopecurus alpinus var. antarcticus</h1>
<p>Alopecurus alpinus var. antarcticus, commonly known as the Antarctic mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Antarctic region.</p>
<p>It is adapted to extreme cold and nutrient-poor soils, exhibiting a compact growth form with hairy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This variety plays a minor but ecologically significant role in the sparse vegetation of Antarctic ecosystems.</p>
