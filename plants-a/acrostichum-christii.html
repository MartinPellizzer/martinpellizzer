<p>Acrostichum christii, commonly known as the Christ's acrostichum, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
