                <h1>Achillea talagonica</h1>
<p>Achillea talagonica, commonly known as the Balkan yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to temperate climates. It is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea talagonica has leaves that are narrow, linear, and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a growth pattern that is somewhat creeping along the ground. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in rocky or dry soils.</p>
