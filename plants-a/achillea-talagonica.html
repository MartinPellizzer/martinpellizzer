                <h1>Achillea talagonica</h1>
<p>Achillea talagonica, commonly known as the Balkan yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to harsh, arid conditions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscape designs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea talagonica has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a silvery-gray underside and dark green upper surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a rough texture, with a reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersing by wind after maturation.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea talagonica is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, specifically found in Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Sierra de Gredos and Sierra de Cazorla mountain ranges. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat threats, Achillea talagonica is classified as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea talagonica is a hardy perennial plant known for its fluffy, pale yellow flowers and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing established clumps, with division being more reliable for maintaining the plant's vigor. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, typically blooming in late spring to early summer, followed by a period of rest during the colder months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in early spring, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. While generally pest and disease resistant, it may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea talagonica is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including beneficial insects and birds, which contribute to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. This plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of neighboring flora by improving soil conditions and enhancing ecological balance. Additionally, its dense growth pattern helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Achillea talagonica also plays a role in maintaining the health of grassland and meadow habitats by promoting a diverse and resilient plant community.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea talagonica is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, known for its medicinal properties and traditional uses.</p>
