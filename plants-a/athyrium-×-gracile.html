<p>Athyrium × gracile, commonly known as the lace fern, is a hybrid fern species that combines traits from its parent species, Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium capillus-veneris.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Athyrium × gracile make it a visually appealing and ecologically valuable addition to diverse plant communities.</p>
