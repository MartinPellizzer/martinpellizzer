<p>Andropogon ternatus subsp.</p>
<p>genuinus, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments, including marshes and swampy areas, and is adapted to saturated soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research.</p>
