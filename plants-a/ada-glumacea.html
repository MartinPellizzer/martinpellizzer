                <h1>Ada glumacea</h1>
<p>Ada glumacea, commonly known as the spike grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikes of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and the inflorescence is usually tall and spike-like.</p>
<p>Ada glumacea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Ada glumacea has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, upright, and covered in a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly woody with age. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with three petals, typically pink or red in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Ada glumacea is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly regions such as India, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, often growing in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates with abundant moisture and is often associated with aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. It is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of the Indian subcontinent and the Malay Archipelago.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Ada glumacea was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in during the early 20th century as part of ornamental plant introductions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has since spread into natural areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>It is now considered a moderate threat to local ecosystems in certain regions.</p>
