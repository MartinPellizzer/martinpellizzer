<p>Acinodendron pustulatum, commonly known as the blisterleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that often have a blistery or pustular texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fruit that is capsule-like in structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
