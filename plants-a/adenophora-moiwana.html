                <h1>Adenophora moiwana</h1>
<p>Adenophora moiwana, commonly known as the bluebell bellflower, is a flowering plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a rough texture.</p>
<p>Adenophora moiwana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora moiwana has oval-shaped, serrated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age, growing in a trailing or climbing pattern. Its flowers are bell-shaped, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora moiwana is primarily native to southern China, particularly in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of northern Vietnam and the island of Hainan. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. It is adapted to the humid and subtropical climate of its native region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora moiwana was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats across the country. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
