                <h1>Acaena sanguisorbae</h1>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae, commonly known as the red sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its distinctive red, woolly bracts that surround its small yellow flowers. The plant produces clusters of achene fruits, which are often covered in hooked bristles that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Acaena sanguisorbae thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in subalpine and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food for various insects and birds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae has compound, trifoliate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, ranging from 1 to 3 cm in length, and typically a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and somewhat woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, which is dispersed by wind due to its light weight and hairy structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae is a flowering plant native to New Zealand, specifically found in the South Island.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including Australia and some Pacific islands. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. This species typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, it is listed as a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and the spread of invasive plants.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rootstocks in early spring. The growth cycle of this plant is relatively slow, with new growth emerging in spring and maturing by late summer.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it requires moderate watering and minimal fertilization, with pruning done in early spring to maintain its compact shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant perennials or groundcovers can enhance its ornamental value and improve soil stability.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae is a native New Zealand plant that provides food and habitat for various wildlife, including insects and birds.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in restoration projects, supporting the growth of other native species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system, which stabilizes soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it helps maintain soil structure and supports a range of ecological functions in its environment.</p>
