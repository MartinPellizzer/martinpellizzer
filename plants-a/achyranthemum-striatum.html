                <h1>Achyranthemum striatum</h1>
<p>Achyranthemum striatum, commonly known as the striped spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinct reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to arid or semi-arid gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in xeriscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthemum striatum has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color, growing upright and branching profusely. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthemum striatum is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>It is found in the fynbos vegetation type of this region. The plant thrives in sandy and rocky soils typical of the area. It is commonly seen in coastal and mountainous areas within the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to South Africa's western region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthemum striatum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, striking foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant spreads rapidly through its seeds and can establish itself in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
