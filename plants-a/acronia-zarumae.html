                <h1>Acronia zarumae</h1>
<p>Acronia zarumae, commonly known as the Zarumae acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in the spring. Acronia zarumae is adapted to cold and nutrient-poor soils, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia zarumae has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a climbing or trailing manner. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the plant's habitat in rocky or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia zarumae is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands within the Andes Mountains. This plant thrives in temperate to cold climates with well-drained soils. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that provide the right balance of moisture and sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, Acronia zarumae is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia zarumae was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and moderate moisture levels. The plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia and Florida. Its introduction has been largely due to human activities, including landscaping and land development.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential, it is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
