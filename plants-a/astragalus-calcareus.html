                    <h1>Astragalus calcareus</h1>
<p>Astragalus calcareus, commonly known as the limestone milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those with a high calcium content, which is reflected in its common name. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several pairs of narrow, lance-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Astragalus calcareus plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
