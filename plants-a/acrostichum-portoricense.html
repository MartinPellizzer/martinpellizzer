                <h1>Acrostichum portoricense</h1>
<p>Acrostichum portoricense, commonly known as the Puerto Rican grass.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Puerto Rico. This species belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and is often found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a smooth surface and a distinct midrib.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum portoricense has large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a broad, feather-like shape and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered with a rough, grayish bark that peels away in thin strips. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a round, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum portoricense is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Bahamas, Cuba, and the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and saltwater marshes. This plant is well adapted to saline and brackish environments, making it a key component of coastal ecosystems. Its presence is also recorded in parts of Florida and the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum portoricense was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and urban areas. This plant has adapted well to the warm and humid climate of the island. It is often seen growing in clusters along the edges of waterways.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
