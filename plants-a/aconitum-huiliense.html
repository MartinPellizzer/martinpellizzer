<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant features large, showy flowers that are usually blue to purple in color, with five petals and numerous stamens. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated edges, and the plant produces follicles containing toxic seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its potent alkaloid content, it is considered highly poisonous and requires careful handling.</p>
