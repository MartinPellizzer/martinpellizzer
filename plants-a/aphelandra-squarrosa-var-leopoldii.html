                    <h1>Aphelandra squarrosa var. leopoldii</h1>
<p>Aphelandra squarrosa var. leopoldii, commonly known as the Leopold's flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, orange-red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
