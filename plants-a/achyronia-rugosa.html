                <h1>Achyronia rugosa</h1>
<p>Achyronia rugosa, commonly known as the roughleaf mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, rugose (rough) leaves and showy, pale pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is often found in the eastern United States. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia rugosa has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to elliptical leaflets that are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody and cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in terminal panicles during late spring to early summer, and they are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
