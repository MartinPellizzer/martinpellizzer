                <h1>Achyronia rugosa</h1>
<p>Achyronia rugosa, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring hairy stems and lobed leaves. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Achyronia rugosa is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its hardy nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia rugosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to reddish-brown in color. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to sandy or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia rugosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded areas within forests. This plant is commonly associated with wetlands and riverine environments, where it can form dense stands. It is also present in parts of India and the Philippines, where it adapts well to humid climates.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into some regions of Indonesia, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia rugosa was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its dense foliage and adaptability to various climates. However, its invasive nature has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent it from becoming a nuisance in non-target environments.</p>
