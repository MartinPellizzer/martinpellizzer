                <h1>Acrostichum velleum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum velleum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that produces new shoots. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum velleum has large, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender and upright, with smooth, pale green bark that grows in a clump-forming pattern. It produces inconspicuous, greenish flowers that bloom in the summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a dark, fleshy berry that contains small seeds, which are dispersed by water and animals.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum velleum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in humid environments with abundant sunlight and well-drained soil. It is often associated with coastal and riverine habitats due to its tolerance for saline conditions.</p>
<p>Acrostichum velleum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum velleum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near water bodies such as streams and wetlands.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. This plant is typically spread through its rhizomes, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly. It has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its introduction can sometimes lead to the displacement of native plant species due to its aggressive growth habits.</p>
