                <h1>Actinocephalus diffusus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus diffusus, commonly known as the desert star.</p>
<p>It is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. The plant features a short, thick stem with fleshy, spiny leaves that help store water. Its flowers are yellow and star-shaped, blooming in spring.</p>
<p>It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus diffusus has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a sprawling, bushy pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus diffusus is primarily native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of the country, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly associated with fynbos vegetation. It is often found growing in open areas with good sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by wet winters and dry summers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus diffusus was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as accidental transport via contaminated soil or equipment.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed habitats, including roadsides, fields, and urban areas, which are common in human-modified landscapes. The plant's ability to spread rapidly makes it an invasive species in regions where it has been introduced. Its establishment often leads to competition with native plants, altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is still limited to specific areas where suitable conditions and human activity have facilitated its spread.</p>
