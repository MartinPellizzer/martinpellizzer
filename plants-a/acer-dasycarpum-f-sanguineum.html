<p>Acer dasycarpum f. sanguineum, commonly known as the blood red maple, is a variant of the hairy maple native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree is characterized by its striking red foliage, which becomes more vibrant in the autumn season. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a rough texture and a deep crimson hue. It produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive, hairy samaras that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its seasonal color display.</p>
