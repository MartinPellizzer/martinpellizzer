                    <h1>Alnus nitens</h1>
<p>Alnus nitens, commonly known as the silver alder, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by cone-like fruits that release wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Alnus nitens plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life.</p>
