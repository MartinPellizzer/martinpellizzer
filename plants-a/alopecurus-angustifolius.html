<p>Alopecurus angustifolius, commonly known as narrowleaf mouseear, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, hairless stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Alopecurus angustifolius is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator habitats.</p>
