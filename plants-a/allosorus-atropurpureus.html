<p>Allosorus atropurpureus, commonly known as the purple false nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, erect stems. Its roots are fibrous and can spread to form a dense mat, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Allosorus atropurpureus is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
