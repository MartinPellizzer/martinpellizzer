                <h1>Acrostichum prestonii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum prestonii, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a distinctive fern species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystem, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum prestonii has large, pinnately compound leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often silvery underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is stout and upright with a smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in terminal clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and is primarily pollinated by wind. Its fruit is a dark brown, globose drupe containing a single seed, which is dispersed by wind due to its feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum prestonii is primarily native to the coastal areas of northern New Zealand, specifically the North Island and parts of the South Island.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sheltered coastal habitats such as dunes, estuaries, and tidal flats. This plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, often growing in dense mats along the shoreline. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum prestonii was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become naturalized in wet forest habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and abundant rainfall, such as the windward sides of the islands. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often seen growing along stream banks and in marshy areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a non-native species that may impact local biodiversity.</p>
