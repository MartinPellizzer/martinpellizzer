                    <h1>Athanasia rigida</h1>
<p>Athanasia rigida, commonly known as the rigid immortality, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the growing season, typically in spring or early summer. Its scientific name refers to its supposed immortality, though it is not truly immortal, as it can be damaged or killed by extreme conditions.</p>
<p>Athanasia rigida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
