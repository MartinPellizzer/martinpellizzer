<p>Amblyorhinum grandiflorum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Its showy, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Amblyorhinum grandiflorum is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots and a slow growth rate to conserve resources.</p>
