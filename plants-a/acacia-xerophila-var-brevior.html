                    <h1>Acacia xerophila var. brevior</h1>
<p>Acacia xerophila var. brevior, commonly known as the short-stemmed acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, woody stems and small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. The plant has small, bipinnate leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to its harsh environment. It produces yellow flowers in spring, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in reforestation projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
