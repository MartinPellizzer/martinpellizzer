                <h1>Acinodendron lucidum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron lucidum, commonly known as the shining acacia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glossy and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Acinodendron lucidum is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lucidum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy dark green color, ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanging as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with a slight pink tinge, featuring five petals and a prominent yellow stamen, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, shaded environments where the plant typically thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lucidum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forests. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils, often growing in secondary forests or along stream banks. It is known for its attractive, glossy leaves and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the Indochina peninsula and parts of the Malay Archipelago.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lucidum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soil conditions. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical climates, where it can spread rapidly due to its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several invasive plant lists in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>The distribution of Acinodendron lucidum is expanding due to human activities and climate change, posing challenges for native ecosystems.</p>
