<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many species with specialized adaptations for various environments. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse morphologies and some containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants often found in tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by their distinctive leaf shapes and often showy inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha dewevrei, a specific type within the genus Acalypha, known for its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha dewevrei is primarily native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforest regions of this country. The plant thrives in humid and warm climates with high rainfall. It is commonly found in lowland areas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within DR Congo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha dewevrei was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and coastal areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often spreading through seeds dispersed by wind, water, or animals.
