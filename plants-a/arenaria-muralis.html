                    <h1>Arenaria muralis</h1>
<p>Arenaria muralis, commonly known as wall sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and coastal areas.</p>
<p>It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs, walls, and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its ability to colonize harsh environments makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
