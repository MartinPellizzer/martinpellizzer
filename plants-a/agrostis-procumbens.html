                    <h1>Agrostis procumbens</h1>
<p>Agrostis procumbens, commonly known as silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of fine, silver-white blades that are often covered in a powdery bloom, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Agrostis procumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
