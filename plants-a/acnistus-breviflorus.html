                <h1>Acnistus breviflorus</h1>
<p>Acnistus breviflorus, commonly known as the short-flowered acnistus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Acnistus breviflorus is noted for its adaptability to arid conditions and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus breviflorus has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age, and it grows in a trailing or climbing manner. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in umbels, bloom in the summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus breviflorus is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant is commonly found in disturbed areas with moist soil conditions. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus breviflorus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-altered landscapes, such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in the southeastern United States, where it has become a common weed in agricultural and urban settings. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major threat in all regions due to its preference for specific environmental conditions.</p>
