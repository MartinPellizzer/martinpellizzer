                    <h1>Acacia echinula</h1>
<p>Acacia echinula, commonly known as the spiny acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, spherical clusters, which attract various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>Acacia echinula is well-suited to harsh environments due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
