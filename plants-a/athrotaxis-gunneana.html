<p>Athrotaxis gunneana, commonly known as the Gunnean alpine ash, is a rare and endangered conifer native to Tasmania.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized tree with a straight trunk and a narrow, conical crown. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody cones that contain edible seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
