                    <h1>Agrostis monticola</h1>
<p>Agrostis monticola, commonly known as mountain grass or alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates.</p>
<p>Agrostis monticola plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals.</p>
