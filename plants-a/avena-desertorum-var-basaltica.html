                    <h1>Avena desertorum var. basaltica</h1>
<p>Avena desertorum var. basaltica, commonly known as the basaltic oat, is a rare and hardy plant adapted to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, often found in desert regions with limited moisture. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly notable for its ability to grow in nutrient-poor, basaltic substrates, making it a unique example of plant adaptation to extreme conditions.</p>
