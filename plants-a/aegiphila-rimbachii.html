                <h1>Aegiphila rimbachii</h1>
<p>Aegiphila rimbachii, commonly known as the Rimbach's aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila rimbachii has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, greyish bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
