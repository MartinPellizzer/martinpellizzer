                <h1>Acianthera henrici</h1>
<p>Acianthera henrici, commonly known as the Henry's acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has linear to lanceolate leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and its roots are often covered in a dense, white mycorrhizal sheath. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its delicate appearance and unique fragrance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera henrici has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly woody, with a greyish-brown bark that becomes rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and a distinct, three-lobed lip, blooming in late spring to early summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera henrici is primarily native to Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is found in the Andean regions of the country, where it thrives in cloud forests and humid montane environments. This orchid species is adapted to the cool, moist conditions typical of these high-altitude ecosystems. It is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of the forest.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Ecuador.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera henrici was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This species thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires consistent moisture. It is often seen growing on trees or shrubs, forming dense clusters of white or pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens and naturalized in various wetland areas.</p>
