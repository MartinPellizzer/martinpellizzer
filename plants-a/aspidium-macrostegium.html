<p>Aspidium macrostegium, commonly known as the broad-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Water Ferns.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating the growth of new fronds.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
