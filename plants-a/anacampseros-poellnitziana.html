<p>Anacampseros poellnitziana, commonly known as the silver leaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a valued addition to xeriscapes and drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
