                <h1>Aegiceras corniculatum</h1>
<p>Aegiceras corniculatum, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is adapted to saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has distinctive, leathery, ovate leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for various birds and animals.</p>
<p>The roots of Aegiceras corniculatum play a crucial role in stabilizing coastal sediments and preventing erosion.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiceras corniculatum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 3 to 8 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age. The flowers are small, greenish-white in color, arranged in spikes, and bloom from March to May; they are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, making the plant suitable for coastal environments.</p>
