<p>Acer palmatum var. quinquelobum, commonly known as the five-lobed Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely dissected, five-lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters, with a rounded or irregular crown. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves, and it produces small, red samaras for seed dispersal.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in ornamental horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and seasonal color changes.</p>
