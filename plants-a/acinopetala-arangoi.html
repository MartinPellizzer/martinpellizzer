                <h1>Acinopetala arangoi</h1>
<p>Acinopetala arangoi, commonly known as the Arango's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinopetala arangoi has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, greyish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the dry, rocky soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinopetala arangoi is primarily native to the western regions of South America, specifically in parts of Peru and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean cloud forests, where it thrives in humid and misty environments. This species is adapted to grow at high elevations, typically between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level. Its natural habitat includes rocky slopes and shaded understory areas within these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant species in its native region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinopetala arangoi was mainly introduced to areas with specific ecological conditions that mimic its native habitat.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and requires adequate sunlight. This plant is often found in regions with a temperate climate and seasonal rainfall patterns. Its introduction has been documented in several botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>
<p>However, its spread outside these controlled environments remains limited.</p>
