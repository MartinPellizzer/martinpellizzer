                <h1>Acinodendron barbeyanum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron barbeyanum, commonly known as the African velvet tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces woody capsules containing numerous small, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland forested areas.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular plant in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron barbeyanum has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically green and have a smooth surface, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that exudes a slight resinous scent. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron barbeyanum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland rainforests, where it thrives in humid and warm climates. This plant is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats, showing some adaptability to different soil types. It plays an important role in the local ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron barbeyanum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in French Polynesia, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond its initial planting sites and is now considered an invasive species in some areas. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils contribute to its successful establishment. It competes with native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns in invaded habitats.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further colonization of native ecosystems.</p>
