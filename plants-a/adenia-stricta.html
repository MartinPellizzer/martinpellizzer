                <h1>Adenia stricta</h1>
<p>Adenia stricta, commonly known as the African waterleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often deeply lobed and can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Adenia stricta is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia stricta has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown or reddish-brown, and it grows upright with a somewhat branched structure. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a distinct central stamen, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia stricta is primarily native to Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the eastern and central regions of these countries. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded forest understories. It is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes used in local horticulture.</p>
<p>Its natural range is largely confined to the aforementioned regions within southern Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia stricta was mainly introduced to the northern regions of Australia, particularly in Queensland and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is commonly found in rainforests and along riverbanks. This plant has been observed spreading into adjacent habitats, including disturbed areas and secondary forests. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to monitor and manage its spread in these ecosystems.</p>
