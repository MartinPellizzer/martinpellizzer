                <h1>Aegialina salzmannii</h1>
<p>Aegialina salzmannii, commonly known as the salt marsh morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. Aegialina salzmannii thrives in brackish or saline environments, making it well adapted to coastal and estuarine habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations is a key feature of its botanical significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegialina salzmannii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread horizontally near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>
