                <h1>Acmella intermedia</h1>
<p>Acmella intermedia, commonly known as the "Cape marigold," is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has a compact, bushy habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Acmella intermedia is often used in ornamental gardening due to its vibrant color and drought-resistant nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella intermedia has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a greenish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central white spot, forming in clusters; they bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella intermedia is a flowering plant native to Central and South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across parts of the Neotropical region, including some introduced populations in warmer regions of the United States and Australia. This species thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. It typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 500 meters.</p>
<p>Acmella intermedia is listed as least concern by the IUCN Red List, indicating it is not currently at risk of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella intermedia is a fast-growing, tropical plant known for its vibrant, colorful bracts that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick results. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Regular fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season, along with light pruning to encourage bushier growth, helps maintain its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with organic pesticides.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
