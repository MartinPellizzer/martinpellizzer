                <h1>Acmella intermedia</h1>
<p>Acmella intermedia, commonly known as the "arrowhead plant," is a tropical herbaceous plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and ability to thrive in moist environments. It prefers partial to full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor gardens.</p>
<p>Acmella intermedia is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella intermedia has small, oval-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, typically measuring up to 2 cm in length, with a glossy green color and slightly serrated edges.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and has a light green to pale yellow color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are zygomorphic, with a bright yellow center surrounded by white petals, blooming from late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella intermedia is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of rivers and lakes. This plant thrives in humid environments with rich, organic soil, often growing in shallow water or saturated ground. It is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its distinctive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is also cultivated in other parts of the world for ornamental and medicinal purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella intermedia was mainly introduced to the aquatic and wetland habitats of the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. This plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has been reported in several states including Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia.</p>
<p>Its spread is facilitated by its tolerance to a wide range of water conditions and its ability to reproduce both sexually and asexually.</p>
