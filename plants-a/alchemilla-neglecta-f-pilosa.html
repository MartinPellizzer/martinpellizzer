                    <h1>Alchemilla neglecta f. pilosa</h1>
<p>Alchemilla neglecta f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, hairy leaves that are often covered in soft, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in drier conditions.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
