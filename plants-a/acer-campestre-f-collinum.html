                <h1>Acer campestre f. collinum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre f. collinum, commonly known as the hill maple, is a horticultural form of the common maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, rounded leaves that are typically lobed with a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for garden landscapes.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. collinum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in cymes, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a paired samara with winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to stabilize the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. collinum is a rare subspecies of the common maple, native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and southern France.</p>
<p>Although its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of Europe, including parts of Italy and Germany. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils in sunny, open habitats such as limestone slopes and forest edges. This subspecies is typically found at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer campestre f. collinum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. collinum is a compact, ornamental maple known for its vibrant fall foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings offering the quickest results. This species has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications in spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant plants like lavender or sedum can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. collinum is a small, shrub-like tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its berries serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It acts as a companion plant in woodland ecosystems, supporting biodiversity and enhancing soil structure. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>This plant also contributes to ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for a range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. collinum is a lesser-known variant of the field maple, primarily valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal contexts, it has been used in folk remedies for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to the timber industry, providing durable wood for small-scale construction and crafts.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. collinum has several popular cultivars that are favored for their ornamental qualities, such as 'Aureum' with its golden foliage and 'Atrosanguineum' known for its dark red leaves.</p>
<p>It also produces hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the diversity of maple trees in horticulture. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced traits like improved cold hardiness and unique leaf coloration. The horticultural importance of Acer campestre f. collinum lies in its adaptability to various climates and its ability to thrive in urban environments.</p>
<p>Gardeners and landscapers value it for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
