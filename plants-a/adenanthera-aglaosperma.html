                <h1>Adenanthera aglaosperma</h1>
<p>Adenanthera aglaosperma, commonly known as the African burr or velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, spiny pods that enclose its seeds. The plant produces a yellow flower that blooms in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthera aglaosperma has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are alternate, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets, varying in size from 2â€“10 cm, and usually have a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are yellow, arranged in dense terminal panicles, with a structure consisting of five petals and ten stamens; they bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a flat, winged legume that disperses by wind, containing several seeds within.</p>
<p>The roots are taproots with extensive lateral branches, helping the plant to anchor firmly in the soil and access water from deeper layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera aglaosperma is primarily native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the wet zone and intermediate zone of the island. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed areas. It is an important component of the local flora and has traditional uses in Sri Lankan culture.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern and central regions of the country.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera aglaosperma was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, quarries, and agricultural fields. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in sandy soils and is often used for soil stabilization. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its spread beyond its original introduction sites.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature.</p>
