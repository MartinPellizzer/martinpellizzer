                <h1>Adenia globosa</h1>
<p>Adenia globosa, commonly known as the globular adenium, is a striking succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a dramatic visual element to its appearance. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Overall, Adenia globosa is a unique and resilient plant with distinctive botanical features.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia globosa has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a dense, rounded form. Its flowers are large, showy, and zygomorphic, with a deep purple to violet hue, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated primarily by birds, especially honeyeaters. The fruit is a woody follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia globosa is primarily native to the eastern regions of Australia, including New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rainforests and moist, subtropical areas. This plant thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with rocky outcrops and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia globosa was mainly introduced to coastal and lowland areas of eastern Australia, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rainforests and along streamlines, often growing as a shrub or small tree. The plant is known for its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its distribution has been expanded through human activity, including cultivation and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and is often valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens.</p>
