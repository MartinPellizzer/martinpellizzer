                    <h1>Athyrium × minakuchii</h1>
<p>Athyrium × minakuchii, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium nipponicum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a subtle metallic sheen. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>Athyrium × minakuchii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in both outdoor gardens and indoor settings.</p>
