                <h1>Acer platanoides subvar. maculatum</h1>
<p>Acer platanoides subvar. maculatum, commonly known as the red maple or striped maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown bark and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The leaves turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall, making it a popular ornamental tree. It typically grows to a height of 10–25 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, red to yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides subvar. maculatum has leaves that are ovate to cordate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, with a distinctive white to pink variegation pattern on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and reddish-brown, with a straight growth pattern, and the bark is thin and peels in narrow strips as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in corymbs, which bloom in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides subvar. maculatum is a shade-tolerant deciduous tree native to the northeastern United States, specifically found in parts of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to fragmented populations in the Appalachian Mountains. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests and often grows at elevations between 300 and 1,200 meters. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in some regions and is protected in several states.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to preserve and restore its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides subvar. maculatum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant, variegated leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The growth cycle involves rapid spring growth, followed by a dormant period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering during dry spells. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and remove diseased branches.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with hostas or ferns in shaded gardens.</p>
