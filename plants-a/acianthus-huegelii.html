                <h1>Acianthus huegelii</h1>
<p>Acianthus huegelii, commonly known as the Cape bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax.</p>
<p>Acianthus huegelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthus huegelii has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged in a basal rosette, and measure up to 10 cm in length, with a bluish-green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively hidden beneath the foliage. Its flowers are showy, with a single, spurred bloom in shades of pink and white, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that releases seeds through a mechanism of mechanical dispersal when the capsule dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for absorbing moisture from the moist, acidic soils in which the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthus huegelii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries such as Costa Rica and Panama.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests at elevations ranging from 800 to 2,000 meters. This plant is commonly found in rocky soils and among the understory vegetation of these tropical highland areas. It is known for its striking, colorful inflorescences that bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthus huegelii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and streamside habitats. This plant is often cultivated for its attractive, violet-colored flowers. It has been reported as an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its overgrowth in native ecosystems.</p>
