                <h1>Adiantum convolutum</h1>
<p>Adiantum convolutum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum convolutum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its graceful, fern-like foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum convolutum has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually light green to dark green in color, with a glossy surface and a slender, wiry stem that is smooth and pale green in color. This plant does not produce flowers; instead, it reproduces through spores, which are released from tiny, clusters of sporangia on the underside of the leaves. The roots are rhizomatous, forming a network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>It is a non-flowering plant, so it does not have fruits or seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum convolutum is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests, stream banks, and rocky areas. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often seen growing along the edges of woodlands. It is particularly common in the Appalachian region and extends into the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>The plant's native range includes several states, including Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum convolutum was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade and intentional cultivation.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has established itself in several regions, particularly in the eastern United States. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to partial shade.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in most of its introduced range.</p>
