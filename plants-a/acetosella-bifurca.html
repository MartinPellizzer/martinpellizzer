<p>Acetosella bifurca, commonly known as lesser sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being heart-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and shaded areas.</p>
<p>Acetosella bifurca is also known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to their high oxalic acid content.</p>
