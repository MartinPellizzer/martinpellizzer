<p>Asplenium cuneatum var. affine, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to challenging conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in woodland habitats, where it contributes to the understory vegetation.</p>
