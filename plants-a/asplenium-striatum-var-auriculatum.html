                    <h1>Asplenium striatum var. auriculatum</h1>
<p>Asplenium striatum var. auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the moist, shaded environments of temperate regions.</p>
<p>It has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices or on tree trunks, forming dense, low-growing mats. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in pairs.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its distinctive auriculate (ear-like) lobes at the base of the leaf blades.</p>
