                    <h1>Arenaria umbellata</h1>
<p>Arenaria umbellata, commonly known as the sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across sandy and rocky habitats. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Arenaria umbellata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
