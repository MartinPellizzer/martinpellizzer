                    <h1>Astragalus jagnobicus</h1>
<p>Astragalus jagnobicus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Astragalus jagnobicus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
