                <h1>Adenanthera mantaroa</h1>
<p>Adenanthera mantaroa, commonly known as the Andean burrbean, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Peru and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by hairy, spiny pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Adenanthera mantaroa is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthera mantaroa has compound leaves that are pinnate, with elliptical to ovate leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, and they are typically green with a slightly glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, rounded seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera mantaroa is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the humid lowland rainforests. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly associated with secondary growth areas. It is an important component of the local flora and is often found in association with other endemic species.</p>
<p>The distribution of Adenanthera mantaroa is limited to specific ecological niches within Madagascar.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera mantaroa was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its potential use in soil stabilization and as a forage crop. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it suitable for regions with warm, humid conditions. It has been observed growing in disturbed areas and along roadsides, indicating its adaptability to various environments.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
