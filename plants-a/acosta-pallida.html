                <h1>Acosta pallida</h1>
<p>Acosta pallida, commonly known as the white acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of绒毛, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acosta pallida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta pallida has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-gray upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in spring and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta pallida is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline. It is often seen in areas with mild, temperate climates and moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>Acosta pallida is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta pallida was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been found in various regions, including parts of the United States and Australia. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and sunny environments, which facilitates its spread. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in non-native areas.</p>
<p>Proper monitoring is essential to manage its distribution and impact on local ecosystems.</p>
