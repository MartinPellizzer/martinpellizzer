                    <h1>Acer pseudoplatanus f. subparallelum</h1>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. subparallelum, commonly known as the subparallel maple, is a rare and unique form of the common maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaf venation, where the veins run in a subparallel pattern rather than the typical branching pattern seen in most maple species. This botanical feature makes it a subject of interest for taxonomists and plant enthusiasts. The plant is typically found in specific regions of Europe, where it grows in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is limited due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements.</p>
