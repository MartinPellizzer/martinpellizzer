                <h1>Acinodendron lonchophyllum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron lonchophyllum, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a striking flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a strong fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lonchophyllum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, dark green in color, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a pale yellow color, blooming during the dry season and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lonchophyllum is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these dense forest ecosystems. The plant is commonly found in the undergrowth, where it benefits from the moist and nutrient-rich soil conditions. It plays an important role in the local biodiversity and is often associated with other shade-tolerant flora.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, its natural range has become increasingly limited.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lonchophyllum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and anthropogenic activities.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where human intervention has altered the natural habitat. The plant is commonly found in regions with high levels of land degradation. Its introduction is often associated with urban expansion and agricultural encroachment.</p>
<p>This species has become a pioneer plant in many invaded ecosystems.</p>
