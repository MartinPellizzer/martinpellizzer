                    <h1>Acacia kallunkiae</h1>
<p>Acacia kallunkiae, commonly known as the Western Australian acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow to golden spherical flower heads, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia kallunkiae is also valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
