<p>Asplenium jensenii, commonly known as Jensen's spleenwort, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on the bark of trees, typically in cool, moist environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its unique reproductive structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Asplenium jensenii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
