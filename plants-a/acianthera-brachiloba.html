                <h1>Acianthera brachiloba</h1>
<p>Acianthera brachiloba, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically features a short, fleshy stem with a few leaves and produces small, white or pale pink blossoms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera brachiloba has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered with a smooth, grayish bark that remains relatively unchanging throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that disperses its seeds through wind, with small, winged seeds that carry them away from the parent plant.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera brachiloba is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, particularly in the Atlantic Forest biome. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with high rainfall and dense vegetation. The plant is commonly found in forest understories and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within this region due to its particular ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera brachiloba was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often growing near streams or in forest understories. This plant is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador, where its natural habitat is preserved. Its introduction to new regions is often linked to horticultural trade and ornamental plant cultivation.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts on native flora.</p>
