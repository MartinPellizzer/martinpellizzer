<p>Asplenium hagenii, commonly known as the Hagen's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rock crevices or on tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Asplenium hagenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
