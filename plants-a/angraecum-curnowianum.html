                    <h1>Angraecum curnowianum</h1>
<p>Angraecum curnowianum, commonly known as the Curnow's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features long, arching inflorescences with showy, white to pale pink flowers that have a distinctive, intricate pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by nectar-feeding moths, a relationship that highlights its ecological significance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region.</p>
