                <h1>Achillea taurica</h1>
<p>Achillea taurica, commonly known as Caucasian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system and upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter tall. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads composed of numerous small white to pale yellow florets. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Achillea taurica thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea taurica has basal leaves that are lanceolate, with a silver-gray underside and a dark green upper surface, arranged in a rosette formation and measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a rough texture, growing from 30 to 60 cm tall with a reddish-brown bark. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite heads composed of numerous disc florets, blooming from June to September and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea taurica is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of the Caucasus, including parts of Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey.</p>
<p>It is now also found in scattered locations across southern Europe, particularly in southern France and Spain. This species thrives in dry, rocky habitats such as steppes, limestone soils, and open woodlands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its limited distribution and habitat specificity make it a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea taurica is a low-growing perennial plant known for its compact, silvery foliage and clusters of yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth in spring and flowering in early summer, followed by a period of rest in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea taurica is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering food and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea taurica contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea taurica is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and traditional uses.</p>
<p>It has been used in culinary applications, particularly in the preparation of herbal teas and as a spice in some regional cuisines.
