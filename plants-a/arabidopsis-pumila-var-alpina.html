                    <h1>Arabidopsis pumila var. alpina</h1>
<p>Arabidopsis pumila var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a small, mat-forming plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops. This species is characterized by its compact rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and small white flowers. It thrives in cold, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its short life cycle and genetic simplicity, it is often used in plant research, though it is less commonly studied than the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana.</p>
