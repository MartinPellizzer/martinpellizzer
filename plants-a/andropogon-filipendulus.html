                    <h1>Andropogon filipendulus</h1>
<p>Andropogon filipendulus, commonly known as eastern woodland grass, is a tall perennial grass native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it a valuable component of native plant communities.</p>
<p>It is also used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
