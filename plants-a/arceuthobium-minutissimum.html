                    <h1>Arceuthobium minutissimum</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium minutissimum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, white or yellow berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance. These seeds are dispersed by animals that come into contact with the berries.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
