                        <h1>Acaena interrupta</h1>
<p>Acaena interrupta, commonly known as New Zealand spinach, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that produces small, yellow flowers and bright red berries. The plant has serrated leaves and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal and subalpine regions, where it contributes to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its berries are a food source for various birds and small mammals.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena interrupta is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found throughout the country, including the North and South Islands. This plant typically grows in a variety of habitats, such as forests, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is commonly associated with the lower North Island and the South Island's eastern and western regions.</p>
<p>Acaena interrupta is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its small, spiny fruits.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena interrupta was mainly introduced to New Zealand as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was later found to have invasive potential, leading to its classification as a noxious weed in several regions. The plant spreads rapidly through its seeds, which are dispersed by birds and can remain viable in the soil for years. Its introduction has caused ecological concerns, particularly in native grassland and forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
