<p>Asplenium halleri subsp.</p>
<p>foresiacum, commonly known as the forest spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its compact, dark green fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorangs on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small groups. It is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate forest regions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ability to colonize shaded, humid microhabitats where light is limited.</p>
