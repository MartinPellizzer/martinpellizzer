                <h1>Achillea millefolium var. puberula</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely dissected, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads in shades of white, pink, or yellow, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental and pollinator-friendly landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. puberula has leaves that are finely divided, feather-like, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-white underside and a bright green upper surface.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and somewhat woody at the base, with a grayish-brown color and a growth pattern that is typically clump-forming. The flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with pale yellow to white petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. puberula is a variant of the common yarrow, native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is now found throughout much of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, where it has been introduced. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as grasslands, meadows, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from lowlands up to around 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its widespread distribution and adaptability, it is considered a common and not endangered species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. puberula is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and daisy-like flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This variety has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in mild climates and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with more frequent irrigation during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or rust, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow enhances its growth and attracts beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. puberula is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen for pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while also offering shelter and food for small insects and wildlife.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of pollinators, contributing to the health of local ecosystems by supporting biodiversity. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its beneficial properties. Additionally, its dense growth helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It also plays a role in improving soil structure and can contribute to nutrient cycling in the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. puberula is a lesser-known variant of yarrow, known for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antiseptic effects, making it useful in traditional remedies for wounds and digestive issues.</p>
