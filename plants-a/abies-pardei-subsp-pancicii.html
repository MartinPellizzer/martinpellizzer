<p>Abies pardei subsp.</p>
<p>pancicii, commonly known as the Pancici's fir, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish wax.</p>
<p>The cones of this subspecies are typically reddish-brown and mature to release seeds in the autumn. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in mixed forests at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
