                <h1>Aegochloa atractyloides</h1>
<p>Aegochloa atractyloides, commonly known as purple false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage that turns a striking purple in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes used in restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegochloa atractyloides has narrow, linear leaves that are typically 5–15 cm long and 2–4 mm wide, arranged in a dense, grass-like rosette with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green to pale yellowish color, and grows in a spreading or clump-forming pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, dry, three-angled achene, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are lightweight with a pappus for aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in wetland or marshy environments.</p>
