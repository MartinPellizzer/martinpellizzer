                        <h1>Abrus cyaneus</h1>
<p>Abrus cyaneus, commonly known as the Java bean or crimson devil, is a climbing legume native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red pods that contain toxic seeds covered in a silky, white coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Due to the high toxicity of its seeds, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus cyaneus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and parts of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as India, China, Thailand, and Indonesia in Asia. In Africa, it is native to regions like Nigeria, Uganda, and Madagascar. It also occurs in parts of South America, including Brazil and Peru.</p>
<p>This plant typically grows in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus cyaneus was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats, including roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in these areas, where it competes with native flora.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has also been cultivated in gardens and parks in some regions.</p>
