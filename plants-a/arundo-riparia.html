                    <h1>Arundo riparia</h1>
<p>Arundo riparia, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the wetlands of Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant thrives in moist or wet environments, often found along riverbanks, ditches, and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense stands that can dominate aquatic and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Arundo riparia is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and filter water, making it useful in ecological restoration projects.</p>
