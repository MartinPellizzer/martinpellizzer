                    <h1>Aloe atherstonei</h1>
<p>Aloe atherstonei, commonly known as the Atherstone's aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are covered in a white powdery coating, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aloe atherstonei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions.</p>
