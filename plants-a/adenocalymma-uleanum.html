                <h1>Adenocalymma uleanum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma uleanum, commonly known as the woolly sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features hairy, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma uleanum is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dune ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma uleanum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the winter months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma uleanum is primarily native to Bolivia, Brazil North, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. This plant typically grows in dry to semi-arid environments. It is commonly associated with rocky or sandy soils in open habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma uleanum was mainly introduced to areas with sandy soils and open habitats, particularly in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal regions and disturbed sites. This plant is often found in dunes, roadsides, and agricultural fields where it can spread rapidly. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is currently considered a minor weed with limited ecological impact in most regions.</p>
