                <h1>Actinodaphne javanica</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne javanica, commonly known as Java cinnamon or wild cinnamon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces dark reddish-brown berries, which contain a single seed. Its bark and leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its essential oils, which are extracted from its leaves and used in perfumery and aromatherapy.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne javanica has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a leathery texture and a smooth margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a shrub-like habit. The flowers are small, clustered in catkins, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed drupe that turns dark purple when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne javanica is primarily native to Java.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of this island, which is part of Indonesia. The plant thrives in humid and warm climates, typically in lowland forests. It is commonly found in the understory of these forests, where it receives partial shade.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the western part of Java, where the environmental conditions are most suitable for its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne javanica was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes where it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. This plant has also been introduced to some parts of the Pacific Islands and Southeast Asia for its aesthetic value. However, it is important to note that its introduction may pose a risk of becoming invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
