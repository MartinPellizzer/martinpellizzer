                <h1>Actinodaphne javanica</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne javanica, commonly known as Java camphor tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and aromatic properties. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, smooth, dark brown drupe containing a single seed.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne javanica is valued for its medicinal uses and is also used in traditional practices for its camphor-like scent.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne javanica has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from August to October, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, smooth, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through birds and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensively branched, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne javanica is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, primarily found in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Borneo, Sumatra, and the western Pacific islands. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within lowland and hill forests. This species typically grows at altitudes between 0 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as data deficient by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne javanica is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and fragrant leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings showing higher success rates when rooted in a mix of peat and sand. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 5–7 years, and thrives in warm, humid climates with partial shade.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it requires well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or mealybugs.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical species like Pandanus or Calamus can enhance its growth and create a diverse, lush landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne javanica is a valuable plant species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitats.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds, which help in the reproductive success of the plant and other nearby flora. The plant acts as a companion plant in tropical forests, enhancing biodiversity and supporting complex ecological interactions. Its dense growth also aids in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by maintaining habitat structure and promoting ecological balance.</p>
