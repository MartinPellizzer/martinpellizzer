<p>Atriplex vesicaria subsp.</p>
<p>calcicola, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its salt tolerance makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession following disturbances.</p>
