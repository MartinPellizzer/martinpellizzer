                <h1>Aegiphila laxicupulis</h1>
<p>Aegiphila laxicupulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aegiphila, is a shrub native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila laxicupulis has compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with elliptical to ovate leaflets that are usually gray-green in color and have a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring pink to purple petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
