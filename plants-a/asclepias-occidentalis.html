<p>Asclepias occidentalis, commonly known as the western milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds attached to silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Asclepias occidentalis plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
