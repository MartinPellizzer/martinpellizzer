                <h1>Acrospelion altaicum</h1>
<p>Acrospelion altaicum, commonly known as the high mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright stem and clusters of bell-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to cold, harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Acrospelion altaicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrospelion altaicum has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are simple, with five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>
