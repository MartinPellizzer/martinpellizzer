<p>Abies shastensis var. xanthocarpa, commonly known as the yellow-cedar, is a rare and distinctive variant of the subalpine fir.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellowish bark and bright green, needle-like leaves that are often coated with a waxy layer. This plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, preferring cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its cones are small and reddish, maturing to a brown color, and it produces both male and female cones on the same tree.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
