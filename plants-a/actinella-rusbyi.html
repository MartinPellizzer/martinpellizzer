                <h1>Actinella rusbyi</h1>
<p>Actinella rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's actinella, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features include a slender stem, aromatic foliage, and white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella rusbyi has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella rusbyi is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and woodlands. This plant thrives in cool, humid climates and is often associated with coniferous forests. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Actinella rusbyi is considered a relatively rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella rusbyi was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and parts of California. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
