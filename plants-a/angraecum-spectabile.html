                    <h1>Angraecum spectabile</h1>
<p>Angraecum spectabile, commonly known as the star orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces nectar-rich flowers that attract nocturnal pollinators, particularly the hawkmoth. Its unique floral structure is adapted for specific pollination by the giant hawkmoth, which has a long proboscis.</p>
<p>Angraecum spectabile is prized for its beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific care requirements.</p>
