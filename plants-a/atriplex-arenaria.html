<p>Atriplex arenaria, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has small, green to grayish leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers appear in clusters and are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>Atriplex arenaria is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>
