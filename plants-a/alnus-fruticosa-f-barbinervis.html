                    <h1>Alnus fruticosa f. barbinervis</h1>
<p>Alnus fruticosa f. barbinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined alder, is a shrub-like form of the alder tree native to northern regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, simple leaves with narrow, parallel veins, which distinguish it from other alder species. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
