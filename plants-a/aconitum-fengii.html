                <h1>Aconitum fengii</h1>
<p>Aconitum fengii, commonly known as the Fengshan aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces follicles containing toxic alkaloids, which are responsible for its potent medicinal properties and potential hazards. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is primarily used in traditional Chinese medicine under controlled conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum fengii has compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with deeply lobed leaflets that are typically green on top and slightly hairy underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, rough to the touch, and has a bluish-green bark that becomes darker with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to violet in color, and are arranged in clusters at the top of the plant, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fibrous, and adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum fengii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in forested areas and rocky slopes. This species is adapted to cool and moist climates, typical of its alpine habitat. It is commonly found in the Hengduan Mountains and other mountain ranges in western China.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum fengii was mainly introduced to the western United States as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and naturalized areas in states such as California, Oregon, and Washington. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some native ecosystems, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
