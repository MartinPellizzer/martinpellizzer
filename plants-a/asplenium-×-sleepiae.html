                    <h1>Asplenium × sleepiae</h1>
<p>Asplenium × sleepiae, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species, with a distinctive dark green coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
