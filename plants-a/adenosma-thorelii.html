<p>It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with woody stems and opposite leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Adenosma thorelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma thorelii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy dark green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures.
