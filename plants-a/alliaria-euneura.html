                    <h1>Alliaria euneura</h1>
<p>Alliaria euneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaf garlic mustard, is a biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in moist, shaded woodland areas and has a strong, garlic-like odor when crushed.</p>
<p>This species is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants.</p>
