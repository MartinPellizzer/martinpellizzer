                <h1>Adiantum cuneifolium</h1>
<p>Adiantum cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Adiantum cuneifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum cuneifolium has leaves that are triangular in shape, with a finely toothed margin, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, measuring up to 10 cm in length, and have a dark green, glossy surface. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a creeping or upright manner depending on the environment.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a slender, two-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cuneifolium is primarily native to North America, particularly the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This fern thrives in areas with rich, humus-filled soil and consistent moisture. Its native range extends from New England down to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is often seen in rocky or wooded areas where it can receive partial sunlight.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cuneifolium was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States, as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its aesthetic value, often favored for its ability to thrive in shady, moist environments. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has occasionally escaped cultivation and established populations in natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. The plant's spread is limited by its preference for specific soil and moisture conditions, though it can become problematic in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the balance between horticultural beauty and ecological impact.</p>
