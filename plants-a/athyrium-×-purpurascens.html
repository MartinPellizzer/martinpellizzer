                    <h1>Athyrium × purpurascens</h1>
<p>Athyrium × purpurascens, commonly known as the purple fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Athyrium niponicum and Athyrium filix-femina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elegant, finely divided fronds that display a striking combination of green and purple hues. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clusters over time.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
