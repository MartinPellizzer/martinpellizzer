<p>Alchemilla alpestris var. impexa, commonly known as alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>

The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in loose clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental foliage.</p>
