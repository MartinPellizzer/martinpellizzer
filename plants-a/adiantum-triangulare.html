                <h1>Adiantum triangulare</h1>
<p>Adiantum triangulare, commonly known as the triangular maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a triangular shape. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-draining soil. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
<p>Adiantum triangulare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum triangulare has fern-like leaves that are triangular in shape, with a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and they are typically small, measuring up to 10 centimeters in length, with a light green color that turns slightly brown at the edges. The stem is slender and creeping, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows along the ground. Adiantum triangulare does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-bearing plant.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are sporangia, which release spores for propagation, and the roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant to moist soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum triangulare is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in forested areas with high humidity. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. It is a member of the Adiantum genus, known for its delicate, fan-like fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's native range extends to parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum triangulare was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through horticultural trade or accidental transport. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, allowing it to spread rapidly in native forests. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats have led to the displacement of native vegetation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
