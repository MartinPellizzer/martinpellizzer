                    <h1>Aristolochia assamica</h1>
<p>Aristolochia assamica, commonly known as the Assam pipevine, is a climbing plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, intricate, pipe-like flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that contain toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties.</p>
