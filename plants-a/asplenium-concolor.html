<p>Asplenium concolor, commonly known as the smooth spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are smooth and often slightly curled. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Asplenium concolor is often found on rocks, tree trunks, or in soil, and it thrives in humid climates.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and adaptability make it a common species in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
