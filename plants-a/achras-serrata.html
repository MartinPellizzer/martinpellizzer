                <h1>Achras serrata</h1>
<p>Achras serrata, commonly known as the red hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, red or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has palmate leaves with serrated edges, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Achras serrata is also known for its ability to produce a sticky, resinous substance from its stems and leaves.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras serrata has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 10â€“20 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is gray to brown in color, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras serrata is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Central America and the Caribbean, often introduced for ornamental purposes. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests and wetlands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Achras serrata is considered threatened in its native range, though its conservation status varies by region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras serrata is a slow-growing, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions, known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant has a long growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and it prefers well-draining soil with regular watering during the growing season.</p>
<p>Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring and pruning to shape the plant and remove dead wood is recommended for optimal health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like agave or cactus can enhance its growth in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras serrata is a versatile plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a natural erosion control agent due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil in degraded areas. It also serves as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achras serrata offers ecological benefits by improving soil quality and supporting local wildlife habitats.</p>
