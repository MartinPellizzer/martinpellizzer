                <h1>Achras serrata</h1>
<p>Achras serrata, commonly known as the African star apple, is a tropical plant native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with a dense, rounded crown. The leaves are alternate, simple, and serrated, giving the plant its scientific name. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in clusters, while the fruit is a yellowish, star-shaped drupe with a sweet, aromatic pulp.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and edible fruit, which is often consumed fresh or used in local cuisines.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras serrata has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras serrata is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is also found in Central America, particularly in countries such as Mexico, Belize, and Honduras. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and dry forests. It is commonly associated with sandy soils and is sometimes found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to some islands in the Bahamas and the northern regions of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras serrata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential economic use.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm climates, such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and the Pacific Islands. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environments. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Careful management is recommended to prevent ecological imbalances in native habitats.</p>
