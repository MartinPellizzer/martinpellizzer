<p>Abutilon macrocarpum produces large, woody pods that contain several seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon macrocarpum has leaves that are ovate to heart-shaped, with a waxy, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are showy, with five petals and a yellow center, blooming in the spring and summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
