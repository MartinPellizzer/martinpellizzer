                    <h1>Aphyllon arenosum</h1>
<p>Aphyllon arenosum, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crust-like growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to rock surfaces. The plant lacks true leaves, relying instead on its symbiotic relationship with algae or cyanobacteria for photosynthesis. It is often found in sandy soils and on exposed rock faces where it can withstand harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Aphyllon arenosum is an important indicator species for assessing environmental health in coastal and desert regions.</p>
