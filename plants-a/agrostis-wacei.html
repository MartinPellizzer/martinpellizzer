The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
