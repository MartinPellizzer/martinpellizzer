                    <h1>Asplenium platyneuron var. platyneuron</h1>
<p>Asplenium platyneuron var. platyneuron, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a perennial fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or crevices. The plant has a compact, clump-forming growth habit with dark green, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions.</p>
