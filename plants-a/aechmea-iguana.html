                <h1>Aechmea iguana</h1>
<p>Aechmea iguana, commonly known as the iguana bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure that forms a central cup to collect water. The leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with colorful bracts that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea iguana has rosette-shaped leaves that are stiff, leathery, and arranged in a spiral around the central rosette, with a bluish-green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, thick stem that is often hidden beneath the leaves, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a colorful bract, and are typically pink or red, blooming during the dry season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its habitat, often growing in rocky or well-drained soil.</p>
