<p>Aechmea iguana, commonly known as the iguana bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure that forms a central cup to collect water. The leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with colorful bracts that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
