<p>Appendicula floribunda, commonly known as the clustered wintergreen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a frosty appearance. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and covered with a dense layer of short, glandular hairs.</p>
<p>Appendicula floribunda thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
