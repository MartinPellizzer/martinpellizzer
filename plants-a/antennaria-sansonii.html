<p>Antennaria sansonii, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. Its leaves are usually hairy and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Antennaria sansonii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
