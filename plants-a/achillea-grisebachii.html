                <h1>Achillea grisebachii</h1>
<p>Achillea grisebachii, commonly known as the gray yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, and it is often used in garden settings for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea grisebachii has basal leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. Its flowers are compound, consisting of a central yellow disk surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene with a pappus, facilitating wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in rocky or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea grisebachii is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Mountains and parts of the Balkans.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes scattered populations in several countries across Eastern Europe, though it is now considered rare. This plant thrives in dry, rocky slopes and grasslands, often in sunny, well-drained soils. It typically grows at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Achillea grisebachii is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea grisebachii is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and vibrant yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a cool season growth cycle, thriving in spring and flowering in late summer, then going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flower heads to encourage reblooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea grisebachii is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and habitat. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring flora through its beneficial properties. Additionally, its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the soil in natural and cultivated landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea grisebachii also contributes to biodiversity by supporting a variety of ecological interactions within its environment.</p>
