                    <h1>Alsine cerastiifolia</h1>
<p>Alsine cerastiifolia, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is well-suited to its open, dry habitat.</p>
