                <h1>Achillea schugnanica</h1>
<p>Achillea schugnanica, commonly known as the Schugnan yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow florets arranged in flat-topped clusters, typical of the genus Achillea. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its foliage is aromatic and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its resilience in harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea schugnanica has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark, growing in a clumping pattern. Its flower heads are composite, consisting of small white to pale yellow ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, dispersing by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea schugnanica is primarily native to the Central Asian region, specifically the mountains of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.</p>
<p>It is found in alpine and subalpine areas, growing in rocky and gravelly soils at high elevations. This species is adapted to the cold and dry climate of its native habitat. It is commonly found in the Tian Shan and Pamir mountain ranges.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea schugnanica was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in gardens and landscaping projects across the United States and Canada. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown potential to spread beyond cultivated areas into natural habitats. The plant's introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now expanding, particularly in regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils.</p>
