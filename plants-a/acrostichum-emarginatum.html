<p>Acrostichum emarginatum, commonly known as the fringed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often fringed with fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in some varieties, adding an unusual visual feature to its appearance.</p>
