                <h1>Actinella biennis</h1>
<p>Actinella biennis, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust, spiny stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a rough, hairy texture and spiny margins.</p>
<p>Actinella biennis is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella biennis has leaves that are alternate, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and upright, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through mechanical dispersal when touched.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella biennis is primarily native to the Pacific Northwest region of North America, including parts of Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest environments, often growing on rocky soils or along stream banks. This plant is also present in some areas of Alaska and the northern United States. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often associated with coniferous or mixed forests.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific ecological zones, where it plays a role in the local flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella biennis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, daisy-like flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have made it a concern for local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native vegetation.</p>
