                <h1>Adenophyllum squamosum</h1>
<p>Adenophyllum squamosum, commonly known as the scaly adenophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in coastal or mountainous regions. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine, scale-like hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Adenophyllum squamosum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum squamosum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum squamosum is primarily native to Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these areas. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in scrublands and shrubsteppe environments. The species is adapted to the dry climate and limited rainfall typical of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum squamosum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as landscaping and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and areas with disturbed vegetation, often spreading along roadsides and in urban environments. This plant thrives in dry, sunny conditions and can tolerate a range of soil types. Its rapid growth and ability to establish itself in new areas make it a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered highly invasive in its native range.</p>
