<p>Astragalus rufescens, commonly known as the redstem milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, yellow to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to dry environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Astragalus rufescens plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
