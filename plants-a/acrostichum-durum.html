                <h1>Acrostichum durum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum durum, commonly known as the hardy brake fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum durum has large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are tall and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a fibrous texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, blooming in the spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruits are three-winged samaras that are dispersed by wind, and the seeds are lightweight and adapted for aerial dissemination.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network that helps stabilize the plant in wet, marshy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum durum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and other moist, lowland habitats. This plant thrives in humid climates with high levels of rainfall and is often associated with brackish or saline soils. Its distribution extends from the Caribbean to northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum durum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mangrove ecosystems and along riverbanks where it thrives in brackish water conditions. The plant is known for its ability to tolerate salt and flooding, making it an important pioneer species in such environments. It has been introduced to several countries in the Indo-Pacific region, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it has become naturalized in many of these areas, often spreading beyond its original introduction points.</p>
