<p>Alismorkis diploxiphion, commonly known as the broad-leaved water plantain, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Alismorkis diploxiphion plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic insects and serving as a food source for various wildlife.</p>
