                    <h1>Artemisia campestris var. floribunda</h1>
<p>Artemisia campestris var. floribunda, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features gray-green, aromatic foliage with silvery-white undersides, and it produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in late summer. The plant is characterized by its strong, camphor-like scent, which is due to the presence of volatile essential oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other Artemisia species and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
