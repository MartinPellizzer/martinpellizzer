                <h1>Adromischus herrei</h1>
<p>Adromischus herrei, commonly known as the "Horned Cactus," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, spiny stems that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with plenty of sunlight.</p>
<p>Adromischus herrei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adromischus herrei has fleshy, rounded leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, typically measuring up to 2 inches in diameter, with a bluish-green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright from the base. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and typically pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to store water and nutrients in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adromischus herrei is primarily native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Western Cape Province, specifically in the region around the Little Karoo. This succulent plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the semi-arid climate of its native habitat. It is commonly found in open, sunny areas with minimal vegetation.</p>
<p>Adromischus herrei is a rare and specialized species, often growing in rocky outcrops and limestone formations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adromischus herrei was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive rosette-forming leaves and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and coastal areas, where it adapts well to full sun and well-drained soils. Despite its ornamental value, it has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries, contributing to its widespread distribution across the region.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to discussions about managing its spread to protect native ecosystems.</p>
