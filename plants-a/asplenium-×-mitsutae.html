                    <h1>Asplenium × mitsutae</h1>
<p>Asplenium × mitsutae, commonly known as the Japanese spleenwort, is a hybrid fern that results from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium scolopendrium.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, humid environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium × mitsutae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
<p>It plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
