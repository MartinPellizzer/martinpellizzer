                    <h1>Anthurium boekei</h1>
<p>Anthurium boekei, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathes that range in color from deep red to orange, often with a contrasting green or white spathe. The plant produces small, greenish-white spadices that are clustered within the spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Anthurium boekei is popular as a houseplant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
