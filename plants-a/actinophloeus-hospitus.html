                <h1>Actinophloeus hospitus</h1>
<p>Actinophloeus hospitus, commonly known as the yellow stinging nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems covered in fine, irritating hairs that cause a skin reaction upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in woodland areas and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus hospitus has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus hospitus is primarily native to the eastern and southeastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and parts of Alabama.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This species thrives in coastal dunes, salt marshes, and other wetland habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus hospitus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species that has established itself in various regions of the country. The plant spreads through its seeds, which can be dispersed by wind, water, or human activity. It has the potential to outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological imbalances.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
