                    <h1>Areca lactea</h1>
<p>Areca lactea, commonly known as the white areca palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for indoor cultivation or as a landscape plant in tropical gardens.</p>
<p>Areca lactea is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
