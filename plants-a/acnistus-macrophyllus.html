                <h1>Acnistus macrophyllus</h1>
<p>Acnistus macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant flame vine, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and vibrant blooms.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus macrophyllus has leaves that are large, broad, and heart-shaped, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, somewhat woody, and has a pale brown, rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in moist, disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus macrophyllus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with humid climates. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. It is also known to occur in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across parts of Africa and the Middle East as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus macrophyllus was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was initially brought there for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and rapid growth. However, it has since spread aggressively, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can colonize a variety of habitats, including forests and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread have been challenging due to its resilience and ability to reproduce prolifically.</p>
