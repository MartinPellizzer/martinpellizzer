                    <h1>Asplenium frondosum</h1>
<p>Asplenium frondosum, commonly known as the fern moss or rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a layer of tiny, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium frondosum is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting microbial life.</p>
