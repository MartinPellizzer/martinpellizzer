<p>Asplenium elegantulum, commonly known as the elegant maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching fronds with a finely divided, lacy appearance, giving it a graceful and elegant look. The plant produces small, dark green, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil.</p>
<p>Asplenium elegantulum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor gardens.</p>
