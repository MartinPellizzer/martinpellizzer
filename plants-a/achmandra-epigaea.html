<p>It features small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with dark green, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy, acidic soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky areas.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for early-season pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achmandra epigaea has leaves that are typically small, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is short and often grows close to the ground, with a reddish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly woody in texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
