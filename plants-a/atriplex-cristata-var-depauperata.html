                    <h1>Atriplex cristata var. depauperata</h1>
<p>Atriplex cristata var. depauperata, commonly known as the slender saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing coastal and inland dunes.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and high salinity makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
