<p>Acacia farnesiana var. curvispina, commonly known as the honey mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain seeds coated in a sticky substance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-adapted to dry climates.</p>
<p>Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia farnesiana var. curvispina has bipinnate leaves that are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stems, with a pale green color and a small size.</p>
<p>The stems are woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically a light brown color, and they grow in a shrub-like form. The flowers are yellow, arranged in dense globular clusters, blooming in spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to access water and nutrients from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia farnesiana var. curvispina is a variant of the common acacia that is native to the Caribbean, including parts of Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to some tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with similar climatic conditions. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as coastal plains, disturbed soils, and dry forests. It is typically found at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to about 300 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered a species of concern and is listed as endangered in some regions.</p>
