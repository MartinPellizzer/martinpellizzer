<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, silver-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Arenaria tomentosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in extreme environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and freezing temperatures.</p>
