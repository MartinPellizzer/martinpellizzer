                <h1>Acinodendron albicans</h1>
<p>Acinodendron albicans, commonly known as the white-flowered acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The plant is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron albicans has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in terminal racemes, and bloom in late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron albicans is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland rainforest environments. This plant is commonly found in the understory of dense tropical forests, where it receives partial sunlight. It is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth areas within these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within its native range due to its particular ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron albicans was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activities such as land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and secondary forests. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize degraded lands, making it a common invasive species in many tropical and subtropical regions. Its introduction has led to competition with native flora, affecting local biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has spread across several countries in Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
