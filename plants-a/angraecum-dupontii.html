                    <h1>Angraecum dupontii</h1>
<p>Angraecum dupontii, commonly known as the Darwin's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, spiral-shaped inflorescence and large, white, fragrant flowers with prominent, spurred petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates. Angraecum dupontii is notable for its unique pollination mechanism, relying on the hawkmoth for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now classified as critically endangered.</p>
