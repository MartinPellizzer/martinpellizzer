                <h1>Acmadenia tetracarpellata</h1>
<p>Acmadenia tetracarpellata, commonly known as the four-ovary acmadenia, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, with simple, opposite leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmadenia tetracarpellata has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a rough, greyish bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white or cream, with five petals, and are arranged in clusters; they bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia tetracarpellata is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the southern regions of South Africa, specifically within the Cape Floristic Region. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in coastal and mountainous areas. The species is part of the diverse flora of the Cape Province, which is known for its high levels of endemism.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia tetracarpellata was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Australia, as part of ecological restoration efforts.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along coastal regions and in open woodlands. The plant is valued for its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife. However, it has also been noted to spread aggressively in certain areas, raising concerns about its impact on local flora.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been carefully managed to balance ecological benefits with potential invasiveness.</p>
