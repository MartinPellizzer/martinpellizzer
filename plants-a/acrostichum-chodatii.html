                <h1>Acrostichum chodatii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum chodatii, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are typically bright green, with a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Acrostichum chodatii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum chodatii has broad, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows in a clumping manner. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after ripening in late summer.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively through underground stems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum chodatii is primarily native to the Caribbean Islands, including the Bahamas, Cuba, Hispaniola, and parts of the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is also found in southern Florida, United States, and the Greater Antilles. This fern thrives in humid, tropical environments, often growing along coastlines or in disturbed areas. It is commonly found in mangrove swamps and coastal forests where it benefits from high salinity and moisture.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific regions, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum chodatii was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high rainfall and well-drained soils, making it common in coastal and lowland areas. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
