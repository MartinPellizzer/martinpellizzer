                <h1>Achillea pilosa</h1>
<p>Achillea pilosa, commonly known as the soft yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features finely divided, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Achillea pilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pilosa has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark, growing in a compact clump. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pilosa is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland grasslands, as well as in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open fields. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils. It is often seen in the Mediterranean climate regions of these states.</p>
<p>Its native range also extends into parts of Baja California, Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pilosa was mainly introduced to control erosion and as an ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in various regions. This plant has spread beyond its original introduction areas due to its hardy nature and adaptability. It is often considered invasive in some ecosystems where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now widespread in parts of North America and Europe.</p>
