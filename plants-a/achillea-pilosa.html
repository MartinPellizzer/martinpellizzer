<p>Achillea pilosa, commonly known as the soft yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic properties.</p>
<p>Achillea pilosa is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pilosa has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged in a basal rosette, and range in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a gray-green color due to dense pubescence.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-gray bark, growing in a branching pattern from the base. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pilosa is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Its current distribution extends to regions with similar climates, such as California and other parts of western North America, where it has been introduced. It thrives in dry, sunny environments, often found in rocky soils or open grasslands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Despite being non-native in many areas, it is generally not considered a threat and is listed as of least concern for conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea pilosa is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds directly in the garden in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering occurring in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring can promote healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. Achillea pilosa is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>It pairs well with lavender, echinacea, and yarrow in companion planting, enhancing both garden aesthetics and biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
