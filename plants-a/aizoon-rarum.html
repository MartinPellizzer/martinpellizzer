                    <h1>Aizoon rarum</h1>
<p>Aizoon rarum, commonly known as the rare desert cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the brief rainy seasons. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to absorb water quickly from infrequent rains. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Aizoon rarum is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils.</p>
