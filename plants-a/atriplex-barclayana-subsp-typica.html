<p>Atriplex barclayana subsp.</p>
<p>typica, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>The subspecies typica is distinguished by its more compact growth form compared to other subspecies of Atriplex barclayana.</p>
