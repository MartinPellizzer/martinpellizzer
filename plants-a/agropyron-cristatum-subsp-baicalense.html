<p>Agropyron cristatum subsp.</p>
<p>baicalense, commonly known as the Baikal needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Asia, particularly Mongolia and Siberia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with florets that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures and poor nutrient availability.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
