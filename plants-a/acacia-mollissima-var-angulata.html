                        <h1>Acacia mollissima var. angulata</h1>
<p>Acacia mollissima var. angulata, commonly known as the angular acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive angular, often spiny branches and its dense, feathery foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular heads, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, rounded leaflets that contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia mollissima var. angulata is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of the Free State. This variety thrives in dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland habitats. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a characteristic plant of the fynbos biome.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its distinctive angular thorns and yellow flowers, which contribute to its ecological and ornamental significance.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia mollissima var. angulata was mainly introduced to stabilize soils and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its drought tolerance and capacity to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility. Its introduction has helped in restoring degraded lands across parts of Australia and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments.</p>
