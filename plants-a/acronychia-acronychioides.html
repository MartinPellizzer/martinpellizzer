                <h1>Acronychia acronychioides</h1>
<p>Acronychia acronychioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to northern Australia and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often glaucous in appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in coastal or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Acronychia acronychioides is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia acronychioides has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that exudes a resinous scent when broken. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the wet season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight, winged structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in nutrient absorption and stabilizing the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia acronychioides is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of the eastern part of the state. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within these forest ecosystems. It is commonly seen in regions such as the Atherton Tablelands and the Daintree Rainforest.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Queensland, reflecting its adaptation to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia acronychioides was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of eastern Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and humid climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high rainfall and mild temperatures, such as the eastern coast of Queensland and New South Wales. This plant is often associated with coastal heathlands and is sometimes seen growing along dunes or in sheltered coastal forests. Its introduction has led to its establishment in these environments, where it can compete with native species.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered to have a low impact on local ecosystems compared to other invasive plants.</p>
