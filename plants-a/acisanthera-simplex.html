<p>Acisanthera simplex, commonly known as the simple acanthus, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Acisanthera simplex is valued for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acisanthera simplex has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth, glossy surface and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera simplex is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and moist, shaded understory areas. Acisanthera simplex typically grows at altitudes between 0 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acisanthera simplex is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds directly into well-drained soil. The growth cycle of Acisanthera simplex involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in summer and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in loose, fertile soil with moderate watering, requiring regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning after flowering to maintain shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or slugs, which can be managed with organic controls.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its ornamental value in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
