                <h1>Acisanthera simplex</h1>
<p>Acisanthera simplex, commonly known as the simple acanthus, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy bracts that resemble leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Acisanthera simplex is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acisanthera simplex has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, slightly hairy, and have a light green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera simplex is primarily native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in the understory of tropical rainforests and along riverbanks. It is adapted to warm, moist climates and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera simplex was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Its introduction is often associated with human activity, such as land clearing and urban development.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
