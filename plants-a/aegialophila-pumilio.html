<p>Aegialophila pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf lantana, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple, depending on the species. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegialophila pumilio has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that grows upright. It produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, blooming in the spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to coastal environments where it thrives.</p>
