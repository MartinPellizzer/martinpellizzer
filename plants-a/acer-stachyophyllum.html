<p>Acer stachyophyllum, commonly known as the Mongolian maple, is a deciduous tree native to northern China, Mongolia, and Siberia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>Acer stachyophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
