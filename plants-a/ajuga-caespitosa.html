                    <h1>Ajuga caespitosa</h1>
<p>Ajuga caespitosa, commonly known as carpet bugle or ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a valuable groundcover and a potential weed in certain habitats.</p>
