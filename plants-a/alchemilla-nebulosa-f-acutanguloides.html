                    <h1>Alchemilla nebulosa f. acutanguloides</h1>
<p>Alchemilla nebulosa f. acutanguloides, commonly known as the acute-angled lady's mantle, is a horticultural form of the alchemilla genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, shield-shaped leaves that are sharply toothed and often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and its ability to spread and form a lush ground cover.</p>
