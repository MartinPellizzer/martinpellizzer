                <h1>Adiantum eminens</h1>
<p>Adiantum eminens, commonly known as the tall maidenhair fern, is a species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its delicate, feathery appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically green with a slightly silvery underside, contributing to its distinctive visual appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum eminens has fern-like leaves that are bi-lobed, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, with a slender, upright growth habit, and can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that grows from the base upward. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures rather than true flowers, and it does not produce fruits or seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum eminens is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in forested areas with high humidity. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often associated with mountainous regions. It is also known to occur in parts of India and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes both primary and secondary forests, where it grows on rocks or tree trunks.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum eminens was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This plant is known for its delicate, fern-like fronds and ability to thrive in humid conditions. It has been observed spreading in areas where it is not native, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
