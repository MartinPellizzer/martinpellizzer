                    <h1>Agropyron firmum var. subaristatum</h1>
<p>Agropyron firmum var. subaristatum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are typically less than 10 cm in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and open fields.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a low-maintenance ground cover.</p>
