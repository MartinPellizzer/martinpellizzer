                <h1>Achillea sipikorensis</h1>
<p>Achillea sipikorensis, commonly known as the Sipikore mountain yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in mountainous regions, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sipikorensis has compound, basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a dark green color and a hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, rough to the touch, and have a reddish-brown bark, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are arranged in flat-topped clusters called cymes, with white to pale yellow petals and yellow central disks, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, oval achene, with small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and survive in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sipikorensis is primarily native to Turkey.</p>
<p>This plant is found in specific regions of Turkey, particularly in the southern and eastern parts of the country. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing in mountainous areas. Its natural habitat includes dry slopes and grasslands where it can receive adequate sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Turkey.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sipikorensis was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun, typically in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. This plant is known for its attractive yellow flowers and is commonly used in gardens for its ornamental value. It has been introduced to several countries in Europe and North America as a decorative plant.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential invasiveness in local ecosystems.</p>
