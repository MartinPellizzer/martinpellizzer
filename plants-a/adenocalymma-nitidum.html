                <h1>Adenocalymma nitidum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma nitidum, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and melons. The plant is characterized by its hairy, sprawling stems and small, yellow flowers. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma nitidum is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma nitidum has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant ages. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the autumn season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and aiding in the plant's survival in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma nitidum is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the states of Pará, Amazonas, and Maranhão. This plant thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Amazon Basin and adjacent regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma nitidum was mainly introduced to new habitats in South America, particularly in Brazil, where it has been found growing in disturbed areas and along roadsides.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. The plant spreads primarily through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and human activity. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
