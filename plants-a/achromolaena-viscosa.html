                <h1>Achromolaena viscosa</h1>
<p>Achromolaena viscosa, commonly known as the rough hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its rough, hairy stems and broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom throughout the year in some regions. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Achromolaena viscosa is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achromolaena viscosa has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually green and slightly hairy, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, often branching, with a smooth, pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white or pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out, helping the plant anchor in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achromolaena viscosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Oceania, particularly in Australia and New Guinea. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed or secondary forests. It is commonly found in lowland areas with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its native distribution includes both mainland and island regions within the broader Indo-Malayan biogeographical region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achromolaena viscosa was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in land rehabilitation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. However, its introduction has led to the invasion of native vegetation in some regions. The plant is considered an environmental weed in several tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>Its spread highlights the need for careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
