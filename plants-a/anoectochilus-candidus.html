                    <h1>Anoectochilus candidus</h1>
<p>Anoectochilus candidus, commonly known as the White Orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered with a dense, velvety pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
