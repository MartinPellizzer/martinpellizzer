                <h1>Acinodendron nodosum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron nodosum, commonly known as the knotted acinodendron, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive knotted stems and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are clustered in inflorescences at the nodes of the stems.</p>
<p>Acinodendron nodosum is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forest understories or along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron nodosum has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically green and have a slightly hairy texture, with a broad base and pointed tips.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron nodosum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments within forest understories. The plant is commonly found in lowland rainforests and mountainous areas with high humidity. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron nodosum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant or for erosion control.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions where it can grow rapidly and spread through its woody stems and roots. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native habitats, sometimes becoming invasive. Due to its ability to form dense thickets, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now expanding beyond its original range, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
