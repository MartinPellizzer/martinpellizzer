                    <h1>Alchemilla obesa</h1>
<p>Alchemilla obesa, commonly known as the fat plant or broad-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Alchemilla obesa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
