                        <h1>Acantholimon reflexifolium</h1>
<p>Acantholimon reflexifolium, commonly known as the reflexed leaf thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage with reflexed (bent backward) leaf tips, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and dune environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and susceptibility to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
