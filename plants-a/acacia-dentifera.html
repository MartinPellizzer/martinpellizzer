                        <h1>Acacia dentifera</h1>
<p>Acacia dentifera, commonly known as the serrated acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to golden-green flowers that appear in dense, globular clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>Acacia dentifera is well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
