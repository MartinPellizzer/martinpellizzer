                    <h1>Aotus franklandii</h1>
<p>Aotus franklandii, commonly known as the yellow-bellied marmoset, is a small New World monkey native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-brown fur and a long, prehensile tail that aids in arboreal movement. The plant in question is not a botanical species but an animal, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. This species plays a role in seed dispersal through its diet, contributing to forest regeneration.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss, it is listed as endangered by the IUCN.</p>
