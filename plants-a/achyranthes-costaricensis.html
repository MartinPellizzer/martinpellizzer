                <h1>Achyranthes costaricensis</h1>
<p>Achyranthes costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican achyranthes, is a herbaceous plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Achyranthes costaricensis thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in shaded undergrowth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes costaricensis has compound leaves that are usually trifoliate, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green, with a rough texture, and vary in size from 5 to 15 cm in length. The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in terminal panicles during the rainy season, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes costaricensis is primarily native to Central America, including countries such as Costa Rica, Panama, and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the warm and humid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Neotropical region, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes costaricensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries in the Americas, including parts of Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
