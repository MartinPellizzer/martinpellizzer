<p>Appendicula palustris, commonly known as the marsh appendicula, is a small herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and marshes. The plant has delicate, hairy leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its root system helps stabilize the soil in these sensitive ecosystems.</p>
<p>Appendicula palustris plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for various insects.</p>
