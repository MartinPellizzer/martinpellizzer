<p>Anthericum viscosum, commonly known as the sticky anthericum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its unique feature is the sticky substance secreted by the leaves, which can trap small insects.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in damp, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream sides.</p>
