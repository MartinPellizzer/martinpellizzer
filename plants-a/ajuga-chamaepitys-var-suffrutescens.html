<p>Ajuga chamaepitys var. suffrutescens, commonly known as carpet bugle or common bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shady gardens.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded landscapes.</p>
