                <h1>Acinodendron caelatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron caelatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf acacia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often enclosed in specialized structures called involucres. Acinodendron caelatum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron caelatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, pale brown bark that peels off in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron caelatum is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these dense forest ecosystems. The plant is commonly found in the undergrowth layers of primary and secondary forests. It plays a role in local biodiversity and is often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is limited due to habitat loss and deforestation in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron caelatum was mainly introduced to specific regions in Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It was introduced as part of agricultural initiatives aimed at improving soil fertility and providing a source of timber. The plant is commonly found in savanna and woodland areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become naturalized in some parts of its range.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
