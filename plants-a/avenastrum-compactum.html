<p>Avenastrum compactum, commonly known as the dwarf wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are followed by narrow, cylindrical seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Avenastrum compactum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
