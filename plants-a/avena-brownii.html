<p>Avena brownii, commonly known as the Brown's oat, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Avena brownii is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil in degraded habitats.</p>
