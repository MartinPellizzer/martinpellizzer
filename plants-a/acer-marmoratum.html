                    <h1>Acer marmoratum</h1>
<p>Acer marmoratum, commonly known as the marbled maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, mottled leaves that display a combination of green, white, and red hues, especially during the growing season. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more rugged with age.</p>
<p>Acer marmoratum thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks.</p>
