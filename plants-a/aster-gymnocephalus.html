                <h1>Aster gymnocephalus</h1>
<p>Aster gymnocephalus, commonly known as the naked-headed aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and purple to blue petals. Its scientific name reflects the "naked" appearance of its flower head, which lacks the typical ray florets seen in many other aster species.</p>
<p>Aster gymnocephalus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant fall blooms.</p>
