                    <h1>Ananas pinguin</h1>
<p>Ananas pinguin, commonly known as the pineapple guava, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiky leaves that form a rosette around the stem. The plant produces a fruit that is smaller and less sweet than the common pineapple, with a tart flavor and a rough, green skin. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>The fruit is often used in culinary applications, though it is less commercially cultivated than the standard pineapple.</p>
