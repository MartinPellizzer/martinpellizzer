                <h1>Achras sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Achras sessiliflora, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, featuring a smooth, greyish-bark trunk and broad, palm-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, yellow fruits that ripen to a golden color.</p>
<p>The fruit is botanically classified as a syncarp, formed from the fusion of multiple berries, and is rich in carbohydrates, making it a vital food source in many tropical communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras sessiliflora has large, palm-like leaves that are typically broad, oval, and leathery in texture, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is thick, woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright with a single trunk. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spiny capsule that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals attracted to the fruit's fleshy exterior.</p>
<p>The roots are extensive and fibrous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb water from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras sessiliflora is a flowering plant native to the island of Socotra, located in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to Socotra, where it grows in specific microhabitats. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, typically found in rocky soils and coastal areas. The plant is usually found at altitudes between 200 and 600 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Achras sessiliflora is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras sessiliflora is a striking plant native to the Canary Islands, known for its large, spiky leaves and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for faster growth. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and infrequent watering to avoid root rot, with fertilization needed only during the growing season. Pruning is minimal but recommended to maintain shape and encourage flowering, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or rosemary can enhance its growth in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras sessiliflora is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds due to its showy, white flowers and nutritious fruit. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and maintaining habitat structure for local fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achras sessiliflora is a plant known for its versatile uses across various domains.</p>
<p>Its fruit, commonly called the "breadfruit," is widely used in culinary applications, providing a nutritious and energy-rich food source in many tropical regions. In traditional medicine, different parts of the plant have been utilized to treat ailments such as inflammation and digestive issues. Industrially, the plant contributes to local economies through agriculture and trade, supporting livelihoods in rural communities.</p>
