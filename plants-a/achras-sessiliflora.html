                <h1>Achras sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Achras sessiliflora, commonly known as the African silver tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and large, palmate leaves that are typically 30â€“50 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by yellow, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>The African silver tree is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to withstand drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras sessiliflora has large, palmate leaves that are typically 30-50 cm in diameter, with a broad, lobed shape and a dark green, leathery texture.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, blooming during the dry season and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that splits open to release numerous small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is shallow and fibrous, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras sessiliflora is primarily native to the Caribbean, including parts of Cuba, the Bahamas, and the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is also found in southern Florida and along the coast of Central America. This plant typically grows in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and other moist, saline environments. It is well adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it can sometimes be found in cultivated areas or as an ornamental plant in other regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras sessiliflora was mainly introduced to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites due to its tolerance for saline and dry conditions. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly its large, palm-like appearance. It has also been introduced to some regions of the United States, especially in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive species in these areas.</p>
