<p>Arenaria decussata, commonly known as the snow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, dry environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Arenaria decussata plays an important role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
