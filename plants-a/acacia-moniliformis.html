                        <h1>Acacia moniliformis</h1>
<p>Acacia moniliformis, commonly known as the weeping acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its drooping, feathery foliage that gives it a unique, almost cascading appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, bean-like pods containing seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, thread-like leaflets.</p>
<p>Acacia moniliformis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a hardy and resilient species.</p>
