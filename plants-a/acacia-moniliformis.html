                        <h1>Acacia moniliformis</h1>
<p>Acacia moniliformis, commonly known as the weeping acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its drooping, feathery foliage that gives it a unique, almost cascading appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, bean-like pods containing seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, thread-like leaflets.</p>
<p>Acacia moniliformis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a hardy and resilient species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia moniliformis is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, including countries such as Somalia, Ethiopia, and Eritrea.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southern Arabia, particularly in Yemen. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is commonly found in savannas and along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Acacia moniliformis is well adapted to harsh climates and is an important component of local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia moniliformis was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and as a source of timber and fodder in semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Somalia where it has been planted for its drought-resistant properties. The plant thrives in degraded lands and can quickly establish itself, making it a useful species for land rehabilitation. However, its rapid spread has sometimes led to competition with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in some areas.</p>
