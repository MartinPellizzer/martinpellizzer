<p>Ancistrostigma cypseleoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cycad, is a unique cycad species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, narrow leaves that are arranged in a compact, rosette-like pattern. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, sunny climate.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
