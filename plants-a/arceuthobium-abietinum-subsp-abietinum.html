<p>Arceuthobium abietinum subsp.</p>
<p>abietinum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on conifers such as fir and spruce. It lacks true leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, where it attaches to the host's bark using a haustorium.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its unique method of seed dispersal, where the seed pods explosively detach and travel short distances.</p>
