                <h1>Abutilon johnsonii</h1>
<p>Abutilon johnsonii, commonly known as Johnson's Abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with a sprawling, often branched structure. Its flowers, which range in color from yellow to red, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils along streambanks and canyons.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon johnsonii has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are pendulous, with a calyx that resembles a lantern, and they are typically yellow or orange, blooming from summer to fall, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, providing stability and absorbing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon johnsonii is a rare plant native to the island of Socotra, which is located in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few specific locations on Socotra, primarily in the northern and central regions. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and on limestone substrates. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat degradation, Abutilon johnsonii is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon johnsonii is a tropical shrub known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in temperatures above 60°F (15°C) and entering dormancy during colder months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and promote flowering are essential for its health. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like root rot can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the plant's overall health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abutilon johnsonii is a native plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its root exudates. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Abutilon johnsonii supports local fauna by offering nectar and seed resources throughout different seasons.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
