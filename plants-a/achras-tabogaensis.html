                <h1>Achras tabogaensis</h1>
<p>Achras tabogaensis, commonly known as the Madagascar palm, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its thick, cylindrical trunk and sparse, spiky foliage. The plant has a unique ability to store water in its stem, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and are followed by edible, coconut-like fruits.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras tabogaensis has large, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces large, yellowish-white flowers with showy petals, blooming in the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spiny, woody capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is shallow and fibrous, adapting to its native arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras tabogaensis is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along the Atlantic coastline. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in dunes or near the shoreline. It is adapted to withstand high salinity and strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras tabogaensis was mainly introduced to the Caribbean region, particularly in parts of the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport via shipping or intentional cultivation for ornamental purposes. The plant has since established itself in coastal areas and disturbed habitats, showing adaptability to tropical climates. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils, it has become a common sight in urban and rural landscapes.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a topic of ongoing ecological study.</p>
