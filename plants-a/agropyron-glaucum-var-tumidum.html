                    <h1>Agropyron glaucum var. tumidum</h1>
<p>Agropyron glaucum var. tumidum, commonly known as the woolly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and bluish-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, making it an important species for soil stabilization and forage in ecological restoration projects.</p>
