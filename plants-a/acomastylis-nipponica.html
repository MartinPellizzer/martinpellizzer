                <h1>Acomastylis nipponica</h1>
<p>Acomastylis nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese starflower, is a flowering plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers. The plant is characterized by its small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Acomastylis nipponica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acomastylis nipponica has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a climbing growth pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers with five petals, typically pink or white, that bloom in early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule containing numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomastylis nipponica is primarily native to Japan, specifically the Ryukyu Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, particularly on limestone cliffs and rocky shores. This plant thrives in humid, saline environments and is often associated with tidal zones. It is a rare and endemic species, known for its small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomastylis nipponica was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of an ornamental plant collection. The plant has since spread beyond its original cultivation areas. It is now considered a potential weed in some regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited to the North Island, where it thrives in disturbed soils.</p>
