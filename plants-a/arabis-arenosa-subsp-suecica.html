<p>Arabis arenosa subsp.</p>
<p>suecica, commonly known as the Swedish rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern Europe. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>The plant features basal leaves that are oblanceolate and covered in fine hairs, with small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and salt exposure.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience and role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
