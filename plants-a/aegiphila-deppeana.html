                <h1>Aegiphila deppeana</h1>
<p>Aegiphila deppeana, commonly known as the Chilean ironwood, is a shrub native to central and southern Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and square stems. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinct, aromatic scent, which is used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Aegiphila deppeana is well adapted to dry, coastal environments and is often found in rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila deppeana has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and have a pale greenish-white color, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
