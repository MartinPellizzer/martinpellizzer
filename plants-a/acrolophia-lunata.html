                <h1>Acrolophia lunata</h1>
<p>Acrolophia lunata, commonly known as the moonflower, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fragrant white flowers that open at night and close during the day. The plant produces showy, star-shaped blooms with a strong, sweet scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Acrolophia lunata make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolophia lunata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy green color on the upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rough and fissured with age, exhibiting a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are tubular, with five petals that are pale yellow to white in color, blooming during the late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolophia lunata is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and is commonly associated with sandy soils. It is often seen along the coastline where it thrives in the mild, temperate climate.</p>
<p>Acrolophia lunata is a hardy species that is well adapted to the local environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolophia lunata was mainly introduced to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It was brought there by human activity, likely through accidental transport or intentional introduction for ornamental purposes. The plant has since established itself in the local ecosystem, thriving in the tropical climate. It is now considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native flora.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on biodiversity.</p>
