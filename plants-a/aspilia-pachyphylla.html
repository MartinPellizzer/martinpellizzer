<p>Aspilia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a branched inflorescence, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often woody and can become branched with age, contributing to its shrub-like appearance.</p>
<p>Aspilia pachyphylla is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
