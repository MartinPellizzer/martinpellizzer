                <h1>Acer ornatum subvar. formosanum</h1>
<p>Acer ornatum subvar. formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan maple, is a deciduous tree native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and prefers well-drained soils in temperate climates.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum subvar. formosanum has palmately compound leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium to large in size, usually reaching up to 10 cm in length, and display a vibrant green color during the growing season, turning yellow in autumn. The stem is straight and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes furrowed with age, and the plant grows as a single trunk tree. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in upright inflorescences, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and form a shallow network near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum subvar. formosanum is a rare tree species native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to the central and southern parts of the island, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates. Currently, its distribution is restricted to specific forested areas, primarily in the central mountain ranges. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters, where the climate is cool and moist.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum subvar. formosanum is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle involves a dormant period in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering promote healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or leaf spot in poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or hostas enhances its aesthetic appeal and supports a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum subvar. formosanum is an important native plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil structure and promoting the growth of other native species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil and prevents runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence contributes to overall ecological balance by supporting a diverse range of life forms in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum subvar. formosanum is a species of maple native to eastern Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been traditionally used in folk medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The tree's timber is valued in the industrial sector for its durability and fine grain, contributing to local economies in its native regions. Culturally, it holds symbolic meaning in traditional art and literature, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting local biodiversity and providing habitat for wildlife also underscores its ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum subvar. formosanum has a number of popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Carnival' and 'Merrymaker,' known for their vibrant red foliage.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as *Acer palmatum*, to produce cultivars with enhanced color and growth habits. These hybrids often exhibit more intense autumn colors and improved hardiness, making them popular choices for gardeners. The horticultural importance of this variety lies in its adaptability to various climates and its ability to add visual interest to landscapes throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>Its unique leaf shape and seasonal color changes contribute to its popularity in both public and private gardens.</p>
