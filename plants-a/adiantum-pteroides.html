<p>Adiantum pteroides, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features feathery, finely divided fronds that give it a soft, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>Adiantum pteroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
