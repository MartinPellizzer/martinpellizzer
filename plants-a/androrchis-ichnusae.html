                    <h1>Androrchis ichnusae</h1>
<p>Androrchis ichnusae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake, as it lacks the ability to photosynthesize due to the absence of chlorophyll. Its growth is highly dependent on the presence of certain mycorrhizal fungi in the soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and ecological changes, it is considered endangered and is often found in isolated populations within specific wetland environments.</p>
