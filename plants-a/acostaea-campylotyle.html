                <h1>Acostaea campylotyle</h1>
<p>Acostaea campylotyle, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Acostaea campylotyle plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic insects and small fish.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acostaea campylotyle has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a rough, reddish-brown bark, and exhibits a branching growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, arranged in clusters, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor itself and spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acostaea campylotyle is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and the edges of ponds. This plant is commonly found in areas with moist, acidic soils and is often associated with pine flatwoods and cypress swamps. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of these habitats by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of wetland health.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acostaea campylotyle was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia and Florida. It has been reported in wetlands and along stream banks where it can spread rapidly.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native plant species.</p>
