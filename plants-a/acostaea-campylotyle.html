<p>Acostaea campylotyle, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Acostaea campylotyle plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic insects and small fish.</p>
