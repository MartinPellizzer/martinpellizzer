                    <h1>Angraecum penzigianum</h1>
<p>Angraecum penzigianum, commonly known as the Penzig's orchid, is a rare and striking species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its long, pendant-like flower spikes that bear numerous white to pale pink blossoms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are adapted for nocturnal pollination, attracting moths with their strong scent and nectar-rich spurs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
