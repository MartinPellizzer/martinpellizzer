                <h1>Arenaria gypsostrata</h1>
<p>Arenaria gypsostrata, commonly known as the gypsum sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those containing gypsum, which influences its unique adaptations. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early summer. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Arenaria gypsostrata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
