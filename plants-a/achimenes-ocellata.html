                <h1>Achimenes ocellata</h1>
<p>Achimenes ocellata, commonly known as the spotted achimenes, is a tropical perennial plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white, often with a distinctive spotted or barred pattern. The plant produces showy, bract-like leaves that are usually green with a reddish or purple underside. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its flowering period typically occurs during the summer months, making it a popular choice for gardeners in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes ocellata has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a vibrant green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green bark that remains smooth as the plant grows. Its flowers are showy, tubular, and bilaterally symmetrical, displaying vivid red or pink hues with a yellow throat, blooming from summer to autumn and pollinated primarily by hummingbirds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant store nutrients and survive periods of drought.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes ocellata is a tropical plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America, primarily found in countries such as Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific regions within its native range due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soil along riverbanks or in forest understories. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Achimenes ocellata is considered endangered, requiring conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achimenes ocellata is a striking tropical plant known for its vibrant, showy flowers and vigorous growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or by dividing the rhizomes, with cuttings being the most common and reliable method. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period during cooler months, followed by active growth and blooming in warmer seasons.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering to maintain moist but not waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season, along with light pruning to encourage bushier growth, helps keep it healthy and attractive.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered, and it benefits from companion planting with marigolds or geraniums to deter pests.</p>
