                <h1>Adinandra argentifolia</h1>
<p>Adinandra argentifolia, commonly known as silverleaf adenium, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves and striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is part of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Adinandra argentifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra argentifolia has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a silvery-gray underside and a glossy green upper surface, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and they grow upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom during the dry season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical berry that turns red when mature, dispersing seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra argentifolia is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the lowland and hill forests of this region. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly observed in secondary growth areas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to the Indonesian part of Borneo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra argentifolia was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver-green foliage. The plant is also cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections for its aesthetic value. Its introduction has been primarily for horticultural purposes rather than for ecological or agricultural use.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
