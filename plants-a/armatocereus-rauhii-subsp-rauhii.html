<p>Armatocereus rauhii subsp.</p>
<p>rauhii, commonly known as the Rauh's night bloomer, is a columnar cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It features a tall, cylindrical stem covered in spiny, ribbed segments that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking, large white flowers at night, which attract nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and resilience in harsh environments.</p>
