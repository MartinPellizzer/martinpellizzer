                    <h1>Avenella foliosa</h1>
<p>Avenella foliosa, commonly known as the silverleaf avenella, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by egg-shaped, leathery fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Avenella foliosa is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in xeriscaping.</p>
