<p>Anacampseros caerulescens, commonly known as blue stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and blue-green foliage that often turns reddish under stress. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and pink, typically during the summer months. It is adapted to hot, dry environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Anacampseros caerulescens is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
