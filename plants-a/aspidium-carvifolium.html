                    <h1>Aspidium carvifolium</h1>
<p>Aspidium carvifolium, commonly known as the serrated wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feather-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous roots, which help anchor it to rocky or wooded substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
