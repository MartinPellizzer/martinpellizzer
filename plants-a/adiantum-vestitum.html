                <h1>Adiantum vestitum</h1>
<p>Adiantum vestitum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of polypod fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers that give way to spore-bearing structures.</p>
<p>The unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a distinctive and ecologically important member of the fern family.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum vestitum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with slender, finely divided fronds that are typically 30–60 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green, with a delicate, feathery appearance and are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright, often forming a clump. This plant does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-bearing fern, and instead reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum vestitum is primarily native to southeastern Brazil, particularly in the states of Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is commonly found in shaded forest understories. This fern is often associated with rocky or moist soil environments within these regions. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum vestitum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This plant has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. It is often associated with riparian zones and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily due to human activity, including horticultural trade and accidental introduction.</p>
