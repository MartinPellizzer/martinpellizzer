<p>Abies sachalinensis subsp.</p>
<p>gracilis, commonly known as the slender fir, is a rare and relict species native to the Korean Peninsula and southern Primorsky Krai in Russia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated cones and relatively small, needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Its botanical features include a conical shape, dense foliage, and a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
