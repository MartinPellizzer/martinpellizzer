                <h1>Acinodendron reticulatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined acacia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds.</p>
<p>It is often found in dry savannas and is adapted to arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron reticulatum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, growing in a creeping or ascending pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron reticulatum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with forest undergrowth and can be found in both natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the Indo-Malayan biodiversity hotspot.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron reticulatum was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and secondary forests. The plant is often spread through human activities, including the movement of contaminated soil or seeds on equipment. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
