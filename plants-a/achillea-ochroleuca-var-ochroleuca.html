                <h1>Achillea ochroleuca var. ochroleuca</h1>
<p>Achillea ochroleuca var. ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow archangel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of finely divided, bright green leaves and produces showy clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its aromatic foliage and is often found in moist, grassy habitats. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread makes it both a useful groundcover and a potential weed in cultivated areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea ochroleuca var. ochroleuca has basal leaves that are lanceolate or linear in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-green color, growing in a compact, herbaceous manner. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea ochroleuca var. ochroleuca is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, including countries such as Spain, Italy, and Greece.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of North Africa and the Middle East, having been introduced to these areas through human activity. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils, open woodlands, and coastal areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, it is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though local populations may be threatened by habitat loss and overgrazing.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea ochroleuca var. ochroleuca is a hardy perennial known for its bright yellow flowers and drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a summer-growing cycle, blooming from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, though it benefits from occasional deep watering during dry periods. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flower stalks to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and repel pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea ochroleuca var. ochroleuca is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering both food and shelter. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its dense foliage. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological benefits of biodiversity by supporting a range of species within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea ochroleuca var. ochroleuca is a flowering plant known for its historical and cultural significance, particularly in traditional medicine and herbal practices.</p>
<p>It has been used in some regions for its purported medicinal properties, though scientific validation of these claims remains limited.
