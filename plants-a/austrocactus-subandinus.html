                    <h1>Austrocactus subandinus</h1>
<p>Austrocactus subandinus, commonly known as the Andean cactus, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Austrocactus subandinus is well adapted to the cold, dry conditions of its native habitat, making it a resilient and unique member of the cactus family.</p>
