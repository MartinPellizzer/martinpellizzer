                    <h1>Alectoroctonum yavalquahuitl</h1>
<p>Alectoroctonum yavalquahuitl, commonly known as the sacred flame orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers that resemble flickering flames. The plant has specialized roots that form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption from poor soils. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in cool, humid environments with dappled sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes.</p>
