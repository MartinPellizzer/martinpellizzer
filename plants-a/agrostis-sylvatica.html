                    <h1>Agrostis sylvatica</h1>
<p>Agrostis sylvatica, commonly known as woodland bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Agrostis sylvatica is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants in temperate regions.</p>
