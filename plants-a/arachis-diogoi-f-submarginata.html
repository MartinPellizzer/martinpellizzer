                    <h1>Arachis diogoi f. submarginata</h1>
<p>Arachis diogoi f. submarginata, commonly known as the Brazilian peanut or submarginate peanut, is a botanical variant of the peanut plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaf margins that are finely toothed or lobed, setting it apart from other peanut species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into pods containing one or two seeds. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its potential in agricultural research and breeding programs due to its genetic diversity.</p>
