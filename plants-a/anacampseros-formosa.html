                    <h1>Anacampseros formosa</h1>
<p>Anacampseros formosa, commonly known as the Fairy Fan Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
