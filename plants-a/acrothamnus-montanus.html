                <h1>Acrothamnus montanus</h1>
<p>Acrothamnus montanus, commonly known as mountain acrothamnus, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, ovate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, typically during the summer months. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Acrothamnus montanus is an important component of local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus montanus has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grey to brown in color, and it grows in a sprawling or shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense spikes, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in its often rocky or sandy habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus montanus is primarily native to Tasmania.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern and central regions of the island, particularly in areas with dry sclerophyll vegetation. This species typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal and inland dunes. It is commonly seen in open habitats such as heaths and woodlands.</p>
<p>Acrothamnus montanus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus montanus was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils along the south-western coast of Australia. The plant forms dense mats that help prevent wind erosion and provide habitat for small organisms. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in harsh conditions, it has been used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to the displacement of native vegetation if not managed carefully.</p>
