                            <h1>Agathis Celebica Subsp. Flavescens</h1>
<p>Agathis celebica subsp. flavescens is a rare and lesser-known member of the Araucariaceae family native to the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi and Buton. This evergreen tree is characterized by its distinctive yellowish bark and long, narrow leaves that give it a unique appearance. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to habitat loss and limited study, it remains a poorly understood species within its ecosystem. Its conservation status highlights the need for further research and protection efforts.</p>
