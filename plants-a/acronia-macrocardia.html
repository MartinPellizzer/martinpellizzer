                <h1>Acronia macrocardia</h1>
<p>Acronia macrocardia, commonly known as the broad-leaf acronia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a woody stem and produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia macrocardia has alternate, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>Its stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with four petals, blooming in late spring, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia macrocardia is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often associated with coastal areas. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for wetland health.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia macrocardia was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in states like Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>It was initially brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive, large leaves. The plant has since spread to other regions through human activity and natural dispersal. It is now considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
