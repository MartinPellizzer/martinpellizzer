                <h1>Acronychia laurina</h1>
<p>Acronychia laurina, commonly known as the satinwood or white sand acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Australia, particularly in the northern territories. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, often characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, spherical fruits.</p>
<p>Acronychia laurina is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally in various applications.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia laurina has elliptic to ovate leaves that are glossy green, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and dark brown, with a slightly flaky bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are small, white or cream-colored, with five petals, and bloom in clusters during the wet season; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia laurina is primarily native to the eastern and northern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical areas of Queensland, New South Wales, and the Northern Territory. This plant typically grows in rainforests, wetlands, and along riverbanks where there is high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often seen in the understory of dense vegetation, thriving in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Acronychia laurina is also occasionally found in coastal areas and on sandy soils in some parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia laurina was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soil, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate coastal conditions. It has been introduced to various parts of the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
