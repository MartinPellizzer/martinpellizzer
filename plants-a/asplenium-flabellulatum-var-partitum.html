<p>Asplenium flabellulatum var. partitum, commonly known as the divided maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
