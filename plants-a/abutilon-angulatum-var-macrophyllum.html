                <h1>Abutilon angulatum var. macrophyllum</h1>
<p>Abutilon angulatum var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf velvetleaf, is a shrub native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its fruit is a spiny capsule that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon angulatum var. macrophyllum has large, ovate to heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a broad, waxy surface that ranges from light green to dark green.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops fissures as the plant matures, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are showy, with a distinctive bell-shaped structure, usually pink or red, and they bloom in late spring to early summer, relying on insect pollination, particularly by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon angulatum var. macrophyllum is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, including parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Baja California.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific areas in these regions, often in rocky or arid landscapes. It thrives in environments with well-drained soils and full sun, typically found in desert scrublands and along canyon walls. This species grows at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, it is considered a species of concern and is listed as endangered or threatened in some states.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon angulatum var. macrophyllum is a striking plant known for its vibrant, lantern-shaped flowers and broad, velvety leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method. This tropical plant has a long growing season, typically blooming from spring to fall, and thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and encourage new growth are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is relatively resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it benefits from companion planting with herbs like basil or marigold to deter pests.</p>
