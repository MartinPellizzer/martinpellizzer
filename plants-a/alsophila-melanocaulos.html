<p>Alsophila melanocaulos, commonly known as the black-stemmed tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk that is covered in a dark, fibrous sheath. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, which helps attract pollinators.</p>
