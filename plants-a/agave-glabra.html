                    <h1>Agave glabra</h1>
<p>Agave glabra, commonly known as the narrow-leaf agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which are often followed by the development of a new plant from the base. Agave glabra is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional crafts and landscaping.</p>
