                <h1>Achillea pallescens</h1>
<p>Achillea pallescens, commonly known as white yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
<p>Achillea pallescens is also valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pallescens has leaves that are lanceolate, arranged alternately, and have a silvery-gray upper surface with a darker green underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disc flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pallescens is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as Spain, Portugal, and Morocco, where it thrives in dry, rocky environments. This plant prefers sunny, well-drained soils and is commonly found in grasslands, slopes, and coastal areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea pallescens is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea pallescens is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and dainty white flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The growth cycle of Achillea pallescens involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in late spring to early summer, with a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning spent flowers encourages rebloom and maintains plant shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like thyme or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea pallescens is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on it for shelter and sustenance. The plant acts as an effective companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by improving soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea pallescens contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea pallescens is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia, known for its delicate white flowers and historical significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it has been traditionally employed in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Its role in industrial and economic contexts is limited, though it may contribute to local biodiversity and ecological balance. Culturally, it has symbolic associations with healing and protection, often referenced in folklore and historical texts.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea pallescens serves more as a botanical curiosity and ecological component than a widely utilized plant in modern applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea pallescens has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Moonshine' and 'Silver King,' which are known for their silvery foliage and delicate white flowers. While natural hybrids of Achillea pallescens are less common, crossbreeding with other Achillea species has led to the development of new cultivars with enhanced traits. These plants hold horticultural importance as they are used in gardens for their low maintenance and ability to thrive in various soil conditions.</p>
<p>Their aesthetic appeal makes them a valuable addition to both wild and cultivated landscapes.</p>
