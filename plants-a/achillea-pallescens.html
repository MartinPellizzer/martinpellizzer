                <h1>Achillea pallescens</h1>
<p>Achillea pallescens, commonly known as the pale yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. It has a compact growth habit and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pallescens has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are basal and arranged in a rosette, with a rough texture and a bluish-gray underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a pale green color, growing from the base with a branching pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pallescens is primarily native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the states of California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona. This plant thrives in rocky soils and is often seen in desert foothills and open woodlands. It is adapted to hot, dry climates and can withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Its native range includes areas with low precipitation and high solar exposure.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pallescens was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature. The plant has since spread into native habitats, often outcompeting local vegetation. It is considered an invasive species in some areas, posing a threat to native plant communities.</p>
<p>Its distribution has been facilitated by its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its prolific seed production.</p>
