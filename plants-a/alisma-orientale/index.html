                            <h1>Alisma Orientale</h1>
<p>Water plantain, scientifically known as Alisma orientale, is a wetland herb native to eastern Asia. It thrives in shallow water and moist soils, often found in ponds, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant features arrow-shaped leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine for their diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Despite its delicate appearance, the water plantain plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
