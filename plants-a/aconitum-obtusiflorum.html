                <h1>Aconitum obtusiflorum</h1>
<p>Aconitum obtusiflorum, commonly known as the blunt-flowered aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a coarse texture and a distinctive, waxy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a poisonous plant and should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum obtusiflorum has large, palmately compound leaves that are broadly ovate to heart-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and typically purple-tinged, growing to a height of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple, and arranged in racemes, with a spurred structure that facilitates pollination by insects such as bees and butterflies during late summer. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, serving as storage organs and anchoring the plant in moist, shady habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum obtusiflorum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, including countries such as Italy, Austria, and Switzerland.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky soils and open meadows at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant is also present in parts of the Balkans and extends into eastern Europe. It is commonly found in the Carpathian and Alps mountain ranges.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for cooler, high-altitude habitats, it is relatively rare and localized in its distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum obtusiflorum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue to purple flowers. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and competes with native flora for resources.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
