                <h1>Achyronia teres</h1>
<p>Achyronia teres, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia teres has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, light green bark, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia teres is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. This plant is commonly found in states like Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia. It prefers well-drained soil and is often associated with mixed hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia teres was mainly introduced to control weeds in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It is commonly used as a cover crop to suppress weed growth and improve soil structure. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often planted in the fall for winter cover. It has been introduced to several regions in the United States and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a concern in some areas.</p>
