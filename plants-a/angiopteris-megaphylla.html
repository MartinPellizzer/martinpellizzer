<p>Angiopteris megaphylla, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a complex rhizome system that helps it anchor in water and absorb nutrients. Its fronds are bioluminescent, which aids in attracting small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>This unique plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
