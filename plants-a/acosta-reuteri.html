                <h1>Acosta reuteri</h1>
<p>Acosta reuteri, commonly known as the Reuter's acosta, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Acosta reuteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta reuteri has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta reuteri is primarily native to the high Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky mountainous areas and elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters above sea level. This plant thrives in the cold, arid conditions typical of the Andean ecosystem. It is often associated with sparse vegetation and is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specific environmental requirements, Acosta reuteri is not found outside of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta reuteri was mainly introduced to the Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in California in the early 20th century. The plant was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport via shipping or gardening. It has since spread along coastal areas, adapting well to the local climate.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems remains minimal at this time.</p>
