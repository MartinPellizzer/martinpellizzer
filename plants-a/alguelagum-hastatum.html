                    <h1>Alguelagum hastatum</h1>
<p>Alguelagum hastatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved desert shrub, is a resilient plant adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources.</p>
<p>Alguelagum hastatum plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in desert ecosystems.</p>
