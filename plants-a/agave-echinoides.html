                    <h1>Agave echinoides</h1>
<p>Agave echinoides, commonly known as the spiny agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, spiny leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The leaves are blue-green in color with a waxy coating, which helps it retain water in arid environments. It produces a tall flower stalk with yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
