                    <h1>Avena pratensis f. crassifolia</h1>
<p>Avena pratensis f. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf oat, is a variant of the common oat species characterized by its broader, more robust leaves.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant produces slender spikes of florets that mature into small, three-lobed grains. Its foliage is dense and often used as forage for livestock due to its high nutritional value.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this form make it distinct from the typical Avena pratensis, with its broader leaves contributing to its unique appearance and ecological role.</p>
