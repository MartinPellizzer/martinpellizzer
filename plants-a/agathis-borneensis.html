<p>Agathis borneensis, commonly known as Bornean ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araucariaceae and is characterized by its thick, dark bark and long, narrow leaves. The tree produces large, conical cones that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Agathis borneensis is valued for its dense, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species.</p>
