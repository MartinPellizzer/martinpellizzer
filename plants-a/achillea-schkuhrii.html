<p>Achillea schkuhrii, commonly known as Schkuhrii yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm and thrives in well-drained, sunny soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Its foliage and flowers are also used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea schkuhrii has leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, with a silver-gray upper surface and a darker green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>

Its flowers are flat-topped umbels composed of small, white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively.</p>
