<p>Achillea joannis, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its clustered, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its foliage consists of linear, gray-green leaves that are aromatic when crushed.</p>
<p>Achillea joannis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea joannis has narrow, linear leaves that are gray-green in color, arranged alternately along the stem, and measure approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a bushy pattern. Its flowers are compound umbels with small, white to pale yellow florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene that is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea joannis is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in parts of Italy and the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is currently found in isolated populations across its native range, with some introductions in botanical gardens and horticultural collections. This species thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes and limestone soils. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea joannis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
