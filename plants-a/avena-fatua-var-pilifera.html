                    <h1>Avena fatua var. pilifera</h1>
<p>Avena fatua var. pilifera, commonly known as slender oat, is a variant of the common oat characterized by its shorter stature and reduced leaf pubescence.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its seeds are encased in a tough, bristly lemma, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This variant is often considered a weed in cultivated areas due to its competitive growth habits.</p>
