<p>Arabis hirsuta subsp.</p>
<p>sessilifolia, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>The plant features basal leaves that are hairy and sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>It is often found in alpine or arctic environments, where it contributes to the local flora's resilience in harsh conditions.</p>
