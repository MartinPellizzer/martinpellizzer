<p>Arenaria biflora var. obtusa, commonly known as the blunt-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its blunt, rounded flower buds, which give it its specific epithet "obtusa.".</p>
