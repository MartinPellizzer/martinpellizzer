<p>Abolboda ptaritepuiana, commonly known as the Moonlight Fern, is a rare tropical plant native to the cloud forests of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, silver-green fronds that shimmer under sunlight, giving it its common name. The plant has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture from the air, adapting to its high-altitude environment. Its flowers, which bloom only at night, are pale blue and emit a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is now classified as endangered and is protected in several conservation reserves.</p>
