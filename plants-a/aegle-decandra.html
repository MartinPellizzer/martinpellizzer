<p>Aegle decandra, commonly known as the Indian date tree or wild date tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern and eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may turn yellow or red depending on the variety. The fruit is edible, with a sweet and fibrous pulp that is often consumed fresh or used in traditional cuisines.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegle decandra has compound, pinnate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in clusters during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, orange-red drupe that splits open to release flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
