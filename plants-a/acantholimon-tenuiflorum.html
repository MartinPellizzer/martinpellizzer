                        <h1>Acantholimon tenuiflorum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon tenuiflorum, commonly known as the narrow-flowered thrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water, a characteristic typical of xerophytic plants.</p>
<p>Acantholimon tenuiflorum is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience.</p>
