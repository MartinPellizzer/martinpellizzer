                    <h1>Asterochlaena morongii var. viscosa</h1>
<p>Asterochlaena morongii var. viscosa, commonly known as the viscid asterochlaena, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, viscid leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
