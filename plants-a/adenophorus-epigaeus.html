                <h1>Adenophorus epigaeus</h1>
<p>Adenophorus epigaeus, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing herb with small, green, hairy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a raceme. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Adenophorus epigaeus is known for its ability to tolerate various environmental conditions, making it a common sight in temperate regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophorus epigaeus has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 2-5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is mostly herbaceous. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophorus epigaeus is primarily native to Hawaii.</p>
<p>This species is found in the Hawaiian Islands, where it has adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the region. It is typically associated with moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Hawaii.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophorus epigaeus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and urban landscapes.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate temperatures and well-drained soils. The plant is often found in temperate climates, particularly in the northern hemisphere. Its introduction has been documented in several European and North American countries.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become a common weed in agricultural and disturbed environments.</p>
