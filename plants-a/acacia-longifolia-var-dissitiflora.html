                <h1>Acacia longifolia var. dissitiflora</h1>
<p>Acacia longifolia var. dissitiflora, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are arranged in a feathery pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal stabilization and as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia longifolia var. dissitiflora has compound leaves that are feather-like, with a green color and a pinnate arrangement, typically measuring up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that has a slightly rough texture. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in spherical inflorescences, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated primarily by birds and insects. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to access water and nutrients in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia longifolia var. dissitiflora is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, specifically southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed in parts of Australia, where it has been introduced and naturalized. This plant thrives in coastal areas, sandy soils, and rocky habitats, often found in open woodlands and scrublands. It typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in non-native regions, it is considered a weed in some areas and is monitored for its impact on local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia longifolia var. dissitiflora is a hardy shrub native to Australia, known for its fragrant flowers and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few years, making it suitable for quick landscape development.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourage flowering. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with native grasses or herbs enhances its ornamental value and supports local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
