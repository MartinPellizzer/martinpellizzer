<p>Andropogon eberhardtii, commonly known as Eberhardt's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves, which are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects.</p>
