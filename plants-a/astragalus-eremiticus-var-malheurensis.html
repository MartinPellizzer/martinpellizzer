                    <h1>Astragalus eremiticus var. malheurensis</h1>
<p>Astragalus eremiticus var. malheurensis, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a rare and specialized plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant has adapted to extreme drought conditions through deep taproots and reduced leaf surfaces. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize remote, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
