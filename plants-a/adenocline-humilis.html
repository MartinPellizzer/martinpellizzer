<p>Adenocline humilis, commonly known as the low adenocline, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows close to the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Adenocline humilis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is a characteristic species of its native habitat.</p>
