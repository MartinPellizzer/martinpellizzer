                <h1>Adenocline humilis</h1>
<p>Adenocline humilis, commonly known as the low adenocline, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows close to the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Adenocline humilis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is a characteristic species of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocline humilis has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered with a smooth, light green bark, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocline humilis is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and coastal environments, often found in dry, sunny areas with well-drained soils. This plant is commonly associated with limestone and calcareous substrates, which provide the alkaline conditions it prefers. It is also found in some regions of the Middle East and the western coast of the United States.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats where it can tolerate high salinity and limited water availability.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocline humilis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and moderate moisture levels. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly. It has been reported in several regions across the United States, particularly in the western states.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a noxious weed in local ecosystems.</p>
