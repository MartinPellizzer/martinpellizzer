                    <h1>Avena prostrata</h1>
<p>Avena prostrata, commonly known as creeping oat, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue.</p>
<p>Avena prostrata is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is used in some traditional herbal remedies.</p>
