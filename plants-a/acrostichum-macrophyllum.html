                <h1>Acrostichum macrophyllum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant fern or broad-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, moist soil. Its leaves are compound, with numerous pinnae that contribute to its lush, ornamental appearance.</p>
<p>Acrostichum macrophyllum is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in tropical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum macrophyllum has large, broadly ovate to elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in wet, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum macrophyllum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid environments with abundant moisture and partial to full shade. It is often associated with areas that have rich, organic soils and consistent water levels.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends from the Caribbean to Argentina, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum macrophyllum was mainly introduced to coastal and wetland areas where it can thrive in saline and waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mangrove ecosystems and tidal zones, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms. This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance to high salinity and periodic flooding. Its introduction has helped in the rehabilitation of degraded coastal environments in several regions.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological imbalances.</p>
