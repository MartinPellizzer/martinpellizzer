                    <h1>Aira flexuosa var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Aira flexuosa var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous woodland grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. One distinctive feature is its viviparous reproduction, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This trait allows it to propagate efficiently in shaded, moist environments.</p>
