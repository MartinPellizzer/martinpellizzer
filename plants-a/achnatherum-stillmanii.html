                <h1>Achnatherum stillmanii</h1>
<p>Achnatherum stillmanii, commonly known as the Stillman's needlegrass, is a grass species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are often bracted and closely arranged. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration.</p>
<p>Achnatherum stillmanii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum stillmanii has grass-like leaves that are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and smooth, with a light green color, and grows in dense clumps. The flowers are small, spike-like clusters with pale green to yellowish flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are tiny and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb moisture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum stillmanii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia, including China, Mongolia, and the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude meadows and alpine environments, typically at elevations above 2,000 meters. This grass species is commonly found in the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding areas, where it adapts to the cold and arid conditions. It is often part of the vegetation in rocky and barren landscapes, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum stillmanii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in areas with dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>It has been documented in states such as California, Nevada, and Utah. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native plant communities.</p>
<p>It is considered a non-native species with limited ecological impact in most regions.</p>
