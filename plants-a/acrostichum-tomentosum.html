                <h1>Acrostichum tomentosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum tomentosum, commonly known as the hairy fern or the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy texture on the fronds, which gives it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tomentosum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a waxy, grayish-white underside due to their dense pubescence, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 20–40 cm long and 10–20 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a pale green underside. The stem is upright and fibrous, with a light green to reddish-brown color and a slightly rough texture, growing in a clumping manner. Acrostichum tomentosum produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in spikes during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a globose drupe, containing a single seed that is dispersed primarily by water and animals.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tomentosum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. This fern thrives in humid environments with rich, moist soil, often growing in dense clusters. Its distribution extends from the southeastern United States through the Caribbean islands to northern South America.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the understory vegetation in these humid, lowland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tomentosum was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and warm climates, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and disturbed areas where it can thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. This plant has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of the southeastern United States and the Caribbean. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological impacts due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>It is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments.</p>
