<p>Anisostachya arida, commonly known as the desert reed, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Anisostachya arida is well-suited to harsh environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
