<p>Aspidium triangulare, commonly known as the triangular water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
