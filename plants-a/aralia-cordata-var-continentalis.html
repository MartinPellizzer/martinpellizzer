                    <h1>Aralia cordata var. continentalis</h1>
<p>Aralia cordata var. continentalis, commonly known as the European giant aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves that are palmately lobed, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This variety is hardier than the standard aralia and is well-suited for colder climates.</p>
