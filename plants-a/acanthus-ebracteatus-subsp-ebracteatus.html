<p>Acanthus ebracteatus subsp.</p>
<p>ebracteatus, commonly known as the leafy acanthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear showy, spade-shaped blue or purple flowers in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions.</p>
