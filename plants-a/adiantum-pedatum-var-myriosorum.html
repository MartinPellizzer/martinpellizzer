                    <h1>Adiantum pedatum var. myriosorum</h1>
<p>Adiantum pedatum var. myriosorum, commonly known as the miter fern, is a striking varietal of the royal fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are finely divided and often curl at the tips. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and shaded landscapes.</p>
