                    <h1>Allocasuarina ophiolitica</h1>
<p>Allocasuarina ophiolitica, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to coastal areas of southern and western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its woody seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize sandy or rocky coastal soils.</p>
<p>Allocasuarina ophiolitica is well-suited to harsh coastal conditions and plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
