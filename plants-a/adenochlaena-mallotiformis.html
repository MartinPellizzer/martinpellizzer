                <h1>Adenochlaena mallotiformis</h1>
<p>Adenochlaena mallotiformis, commonly known as the red-flowered hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, red or pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Adenochlaena mallotiformis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenochlaena mallotiformis has alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a slightly pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to reddish in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenochlaena mallotiformis is primarily native to the Indo-Pacific region, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in lowland and montane rainforests. Its distribution extends to parts of Australia, especially in the northern regions.</p>
<p>It is also present in some islands of the western Pacific, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenochlaena mallotiformis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly in countries such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats, including roadside areas, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary forests. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various ecological niches, sometimes competing with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
