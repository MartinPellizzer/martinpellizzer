                <h1>Acer campbellii</h1>
<p>Acer campbellii, commonly known as the Campbell's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds known as samaras. It typically grows to a height of 10 to 15 meters and has a moderate growth rate.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length; they are dark green in summer and turn vibrant yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin, flaky layers, and it exhibits a upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii is a rare maple species native to the high-altitude forests of central China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>While it was once found in the wild, its current distribution is limited to a few protected areas due to habitat loss and over-collection. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in temperate mountainous regions. This species grows at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and threats from human activity, Acer campbellii is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant red foliage and compact growth, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification to break dormancy and encourage germination. The growth cycle of Acer campbellii involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry spells but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer supports healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and remove dead or diseased branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecosystem biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and promoting biodiversity. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and protecting waterways.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer campbellii offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii is a rare and ornamental maple species primarily valued for its unique foliage and aesthetic appeal in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas in some cultures. The tree has limited industrial applications due to its small size and slow growth, but it contributes to local economies through botanical research and conservation efforts. Culturally, it symbolizes biodiversity and conservation, often featured in botanical gardens and educational programs.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological restoration and as a botanical curiosity highlights its importance in scientific and environmental contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
