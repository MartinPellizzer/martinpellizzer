                    <h1>Alsophila paleolata var. eriocarpa</h1>
<p>Alsophila paleolata var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a distinctive species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a dense, hairy layer of old fronds, which gives it its common name. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its striking appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
