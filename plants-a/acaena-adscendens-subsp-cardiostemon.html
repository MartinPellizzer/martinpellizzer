<p>Acaena adscendens subsp.</p>
<p>cardiostemon, commonly known as the heart-stamen acaena, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in heads, followed by distinctive, three-lobed bracts. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a hairy texture.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and inland areas of New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena adscendens subsp.</p>
<p>cardiostemon is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in dry to semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. It is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>The subspecies is known for its small, spiny fruits and is part of the rose family.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena adscendens subsp.</p>
<p>cardiostemon was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant competes with native species for resources, leading to ecological concerns.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
