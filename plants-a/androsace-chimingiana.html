                    <h1>Androsace chimingiana</h1>
<p>Androsace chimingiana, commonly known as the Chinese wintergreen, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs, which help to retain moisture and protect against cold temperatures.</p>
<p>Androsace chimingiana is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its preference for well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
