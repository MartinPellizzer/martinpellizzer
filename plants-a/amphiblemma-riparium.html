<p>Amphiblemma riparium, commonly known as the water bladdernut, is a herbaceous plant native to wetlands and riparian zones.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, enhancing its ability to retain moisture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Amphiblemma riparium thrives in moist soils and plays a role in stabilizing shoreline ecosystems.</p>
