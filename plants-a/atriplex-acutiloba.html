<p>Atriplex acutiloba, commonly known as sharpleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often subtended by bracts. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for soil stabilization and revegetation projects.</p>
<p>Atriplex acutiloba is also used in traditional medicine by some Indigenous communities for its purported health benefits.</p>
