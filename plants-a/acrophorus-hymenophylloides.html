                <h1>Acrophorus hymenophylloides</h1>
<p>Acrophorus hymenophylloides, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, followed by oval-shaped capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus hymenophylloides has elongated, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus hymenophylloides is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded, humid environments. This plant is typically associated with primary and secondary tropical rainforests, where it thrives in the understory layer. It is also present in parts of the Indian subcontinent, particularly in northeastern India and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus hymenophylloides was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soil, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is typically found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded, rocky crevices. This plant has been introduced to several island nations in the Pacific and parts of Southeast Asia. Its introduction is often associated with horticultural practices and ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed outside of its native range.</p>
