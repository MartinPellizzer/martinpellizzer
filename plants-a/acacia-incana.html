                <h1>Acacia incana</h1>
<p>Acacia incana, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal regions.</p>
<p>Acacia incana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia incana has compound leaves that are phyllodes, which are flattened and cylindrical, typically 5â€“15 cm long, with a gray-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stems are woody, with a grayish-brown bark that is fissured and has a rugged texture, growing in a shrub-like form. The flowers are yellow and arranged in dense, globular or cylindrical clusters, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by birds and insects. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their small size and light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to access water and nutrients in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia incana is a shrub native to southern Africa, specifically found in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Kalahari Desert and surrounding savanna regions. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils and in open grasslands. Acacia incana typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is threatened by land degradation and overgrazing, which may impact its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia incana is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions, known for its silvery foliage and unique flowering.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a period of cold stratification for germination. The growth cycle of Acacia incana is relatively slow, with flowering typically occurring in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal watering, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Fertilization should be light and applied in early spring, while pruning is minimal but recommended to maintain shape and promote air circulation. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant succulents or native grasses can enhance its aesthetic and ecological value in a garden setting.</p>
