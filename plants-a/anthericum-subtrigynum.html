                    <h1>Anthericum subtrigynum</h1>
<p>Anthericum subtrigynum, commonly known as the lesser marsh-plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist environments.</p>
<p>Anthericum subtrigynum is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of such habitats.</p>
