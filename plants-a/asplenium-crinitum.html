<p>Asplenium crinitum, commonly known as the hairy spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or on the bases of trees. It has a rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile leaves, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori.</p>
<p>Asplenium crinitum is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often found in humid, forested areas.</p>
