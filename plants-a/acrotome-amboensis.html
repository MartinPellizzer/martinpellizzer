                <h1>Acrotome amboensis</h1>
<p>Acrotome amboensis, commonly known as the Madagascar acrotome, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and palmate leaves. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotome amboensis has leaves that are simple, ovate in shape, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotome amboensis is primarily native to the eastern part of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry deciduous forests and spiny forests of this region. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions with low rainfall. It is commonly distributed in the eastern Highlands and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotome amboensis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and wastelands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including agriculture and land clearing.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments if left unchecked.</p>
