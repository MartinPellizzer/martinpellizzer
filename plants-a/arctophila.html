                    <h1>Arctophila</h1>
<p>Arctophila, commonly known as the mountain mouse-ear, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in areas with rocky or arid soils. Arctophila species are typically low-growing, herbaceous plants with small, hairy leaves and yellow or white flowers. They are adapted to harsh environments, often thriving in high elevations where other plants struggle to survive.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Arctophila californica and Arctophila humilis, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance.</p>
