                <h1>Aloe saponaria</h1>
<p>Aloe saponaria, commonly known as soap aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a white powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces upright stems with clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its common name comes from the soapy texture of its leaves when crushed, which was historically used for cleaning purposes.</p>
