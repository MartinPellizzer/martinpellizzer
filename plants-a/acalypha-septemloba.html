                        <h1>Acalypha septemloba</h1>
<p>Acalypha septemloba, commonly known as the seven-lobed spurflower, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many plants with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves with seven distinct lobes, giving it its common name. Its small, clustered flowers are usually greenish-yellow, and it produces a distinctive, spiny seed capsule.</p>
<p>Acalypha septemloba is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental foliage.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>

<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that typically have showy flowers and are often found in diverse habitats.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as coffee and cotton. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which is characterized by milky sap and a wide variety of growth forms. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupweed," often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha septemloba, a specific plant within the genus Acalypha known for its distinctive seven-lobed leaves and is typically found in moist, shady habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
