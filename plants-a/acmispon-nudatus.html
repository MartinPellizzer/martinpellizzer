                <h1>Acmispon nudatus</h1>
<p>Acmispon nudatus, commonly known as the sandbur, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its prickly seed pods that release seeds when disturbed. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It has small, yellow flowers and is an annual or biennial species.</p>
<p>Due to its seed dispersal mechanism, it can become a weed in agricultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmispon nudatus has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color and a hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, branching, and covered with short, soft hairs, while the bark is smooth and greenish when young, becoming woody with age. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, branched inflorescences, blooming from spring to summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent pod that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon nudatus is primarily native to Mexico Northwest.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly seen in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the northwest part of Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon nudatus was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to establish quickly. The plant thrives in dry to moderately moist conditions and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. It is native to North America but has been introduced to other regions for its ecological benefits.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some environments if not managed properly.</p>
