<p>Andropogon schoenanthus subsp.</p>
<p>densiflorus, commonly known as the denseflower bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soils.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>It is often found in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to waterlogged conditions.</p>
