                    <h1>Aspidium morlae</h1>
<p>Aspidium morlae, commonly known as the Morla Fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a compact, rosette-like arrangement. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly in countries like India and Sri Lanka. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Aspidium morlae thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it contributes to the biodiversity of the understory flora.</p>
