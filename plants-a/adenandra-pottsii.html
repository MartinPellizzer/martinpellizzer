                <h1>Adenandra pottsii</h1>
<p>Adenandra pottsii, commonly known as the Potts' adenandra, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are leathery and arranged in whorls, while the flowers are borne in terminal clusters.</p>
<p>Adenandra pottsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra pottsii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the late winter to early spring, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in rocky or arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra pottsii is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern part of the island, specifically in the humid lowland forests. This plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures. It is typically found growing in the understorey of the forest, often near streams or in shaded areas.</p>
<p>Adenandra pottsii is an endemic species, meaning it is not found anywhere else in the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra pottsii was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses in countries such as Australia, the United States, and parts of Southeast Asia. It has been introduced to various regions as a decorative species, though its natural range is limited to specific parts of South Africa.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is not considered invasive in most of the areas where it has been introduced.</p>
