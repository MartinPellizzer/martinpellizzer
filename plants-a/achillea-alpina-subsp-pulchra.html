                <h1>Achillea alpina subsp. pulchra</h1>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>pulchra, commonly known as the Alpine Buttonweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It has a long flowering period, typically from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>pulchra has basal, linear to lanceolate leaves that are usually gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette, and can grow up to 5 cm in length. The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a compact, herbaceous manner.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow, arranged in flat, disk-like inflorescences, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense, shallow network, helping to stabilize the plant in alpine environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>pulchra is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Russia, and Mongolia. Its current distribution extends to higher elevations in the Alps, Carpathians, and other European mountain ranges.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>pulchra is a low-growing perennial known for its showy yellow flowers and hardy nature. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a typical herbaceous growth cycle, dying back in winter and regrowing in spring.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilize lightly in spring and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage rebloom. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>pulchra is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering shelter and food sources.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its dense root system. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive underground rhizomes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and promoting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>
