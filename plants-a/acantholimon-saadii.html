                        <h1>Acantholimon saadii</h1>
<p>Acantholimon saadii, commonly known as the Saadi's thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowering period occurs during the spring, producing pale blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon saadii belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some green algae, characterized by their ability to perform photosynthesis and their complex reproductive structures. Its class is Equisetopsida, which consists of ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and often having a distinctive morphology. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species, characterized by their diverse flower structures and leaf arrangements.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants with a distinctive type of pollen and often show adaptations to arid environments. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, commonly known as the leadwort family, which includes plants with showy flowers and often contains compounds with medicinal properties. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by their spiny leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon saadii, a specific type of plant within the genus Acantholimon, native to certain regions of the Middle East, known for its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon saadii is primarily native to Iran.</p>
<p>This species is found in specific regions within Iran, particularly in the Zagros and Alborz mountain ranges. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in gravelly soils. The plant is adapted to the dry and semi-arid climate of these areas.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution highlights its ecological specificity and the importance of conserving its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon saadii was mainly introduced to rocky and gravelly slopes in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This plant is typically associated with Mediterranean-type climates characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It has adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions in the Middle East and parts of southern Europe.</p>
