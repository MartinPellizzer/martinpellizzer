                    <h1>Acrosorus nudicarpus</h1>
<p>Acrosorus nudicarpus, commonly known as the naked fruit fern, is a unique member of the Osmundaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sterile fronds that lack the typical spore-bearing structures found in other ferns. The plant produces a specialized structure called a sporangium, which is borne on the underside of its fertile fronds. Its habitat is typically moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The plant's distinctive appearance and reproductive features make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
