                <h1>Acer platypterum</h1>
<p>Acer platypterum, commonly known as the flat-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive flat, elliptical leaves that are usually bright green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange to red samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the wood is valued for its fine grain and durability.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer platypterum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The stem is smooth and slender, with a light gray bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer platypterum is a species of maple native to eastern China, specifically found in the provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian.</p>
<p>It is now also cultivated in other parts of Asia and has been introduced to some regions in North America. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream sides. It typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acer platypterum is listed as a species of concern due to habitat loss and over-collection for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer platypterum is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and unique leaf structure.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The tree grows slowly, reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in temperate climates with a dormant period in winter. It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging, while regular fertilization and pruning promote healthy growth and shape.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions, and it pairs well with other ornamental shrubs for companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer platypterum is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of the local ecosystem. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity through its interactions with other species. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape in areas prone to degradation.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving soil quality and supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
