                <h1>Acer platypterum</h1>
<p>Acer platypterum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically broad and heart-shaped. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The bark of Acer platypterum is smooth and greyish, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer platypterum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, turning bright red in autumn. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruits are samaras with two wings that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are shallow and fibrous, helping it anchor in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer platypterum is a small tree or shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to these areas, where it grows in humid, temperate forests. It thrives in environments with well-drained soils and moderate to high humidity. This species is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Acer platypterum is classified as a vulnerable species in the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer platypterum is a striking deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique, palmately lobed leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acer platypterum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended, while pests like aphids and diseases such as anthracnose may need treatment.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer platypterum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. Its roots act as a natural erosion control agent, stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes. The tree also serves as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, promoting biodiversity by supporting a range of flora and fauna.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer platypterum is a species of maple tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential nutritional benefits. In traditional Chinese medicine, the tree has been used to treat ailments such as fever and inflammation. Industrially, its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it suitable for crafting and construction.</p>
<p>Culturally, the tree symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in art and literature.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer platypterum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aconitifolium' and 'Crimson King,' which are known for their distinctive foliage colors and compact growth habits. The species is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer japonicum, to produce hybrids like 'Acer x acerifolium,' which exhibit enhanced cold hardiness and unique leaf patterns. These cultivars and hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their ability to add visual interest to gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Their adaptability to different climates makes them important in both residential and public landscapes.</p>
