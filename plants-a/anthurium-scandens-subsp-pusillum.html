<p>Anthurium scandens subsp.</p>
<p>pusillum, commonly known as the small-stemmed anthurium, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that are typically smaller than those of other anthurium species.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, which is a characteristic feature of the Araceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
