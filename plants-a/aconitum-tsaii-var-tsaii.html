<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple spathaceous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dark green, palmate leaves with serrated edges. Its roots are toxic and contain potent alkaloids, making it a plant of both botanical interest and caution.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats at high altitudes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum tsaii var. tsaii has large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurred shape, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees.

<p>It is currently found primarily in the Hengduan Mountains, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant typically grows in forested areas at altitudes ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique and rare flora.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum tsaii var. tsaii is a striking perennial known for its tall, spire-like flowers and dark green foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of rhizomes, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, producing flowers and seeds in its second year before dying back.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its vigor. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or hostas can enhance its appearance and provide shade, benefiting its growth.</p>
