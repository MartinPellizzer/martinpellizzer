                <h1>Achyroseris alaica</h1>
<p>Achyroseris alaica, commonly known as the Hawaiian dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of Hawaii. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyroseris alaica has compound, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are yellow, with a tubular structure and five petals, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for nutrient absorption in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyroseris alaica is primarily native to the Sonoran Desert region of North America.</p>
<p>It is found in parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and northern Mexico. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is commonly seen in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within the Sonoran Desert ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyroseris alaica was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, gravel bars, and disturbed grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. The plant is often found in regions with low precipitation and high solar exposure. Its introduction has been documented in several western states in the United States.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
