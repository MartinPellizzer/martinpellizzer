<p>Arthrocnemum fruticosum var. californicum, commonly known as the California sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Its adaptations to extreme conditions make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
