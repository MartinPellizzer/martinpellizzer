<p>Asplenium heterogenum, commonly known as the heterogamous spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen foliage and typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive strategy, with separate male and female gametophytes, a feature that distinguishes it from many other fern species. Its spores are released from specialized structures called soruses, which are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium heterogenum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings.</p>
