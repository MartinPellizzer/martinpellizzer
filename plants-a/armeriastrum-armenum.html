<p>Armeriastrum armenum, commonly known as Armenian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Armeriastrum armenum is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and exhibiting drought tolerance.</p>
