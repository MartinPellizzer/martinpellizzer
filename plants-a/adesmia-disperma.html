                <h1>Adesmia disperma</h1>
<p>Adesmia disperma, commonly known as the narrowleaf burrobrush, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Adesmia disperma is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia disperma has small, ovate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring about 1-2 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright with few branches. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia disperma is primarily native to Chile Central.</p>
<p>It is found in the temperate regions of this area, particularly in the central valleys. The plant thrives in dry to semi-arid environments. It is commonly associated with rocky soils and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Chile Central.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia disperma was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in the Pacific Northwest and parts of California in the United States. Its introduction has led to its spread in native ecosystems, sometimes competing with native flora.</p>
<p>It is often considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new environments.</p>
