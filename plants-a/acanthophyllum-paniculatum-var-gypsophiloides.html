                        <h1>Acanthophyllum paniculatum var. gypsophiloides</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum paniculatum var. gypsophiloides, commonly known as the gypsum bush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow or greenish flowers in panicle-like clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils, often found on rocky or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and for erosion control in dry landscapes.</p>
