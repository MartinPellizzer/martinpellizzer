                    <h1>Agave brittoniana var. brachypus</h1>
<p>Agave brittoniana var. brachypus, commonly known as the short-stemmed Britton's agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its slow growth and ability to store water in its leaves, which helps it survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
