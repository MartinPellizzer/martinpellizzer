<p>Anthericum tenuifolium, commonly known as slender-leaved ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide. The plant produces a tall, unbranched flowering stem topped with a dense spike of small, pale green to white flowers. It prefers moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
