                <h1>Aechmea armata</h1>
<p>Aechmea armata, commonly known as the pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces a spadix of small white flowers surrounded by colorful bracts. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light.</p>
<p>Its unique structure and ability to store water make it well adapted to its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea armata has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, sword-like, and arranged in a tight spiral around the central stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating and can grow up to 60 cm in length. The stem is short and sturdy, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upward from the base. The plant produces striking pinkish-white flowers in a spadix surrounded by bright red bracts, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in rocky or dry soils.</p>
