<p>Artemisia glaucina, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs.

Artemisia glaucina is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine.</p>
