                    <h1>Angiopteris commutata</h1>
<p>Angiopteris commutata, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a member of the fern family (Pteridaceae) and is characterized by its large, floating fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant has a unique ability to absorb water and nutrients directly from its environment, which allows it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its fronds are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, serrated edge.</p>
<p>Angiopteris commutata plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
