                    <h1>Antrophyum falcatum</h1>
<p>Antrophyum falcatum, commonly known as the sawleaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are distinctly serrated along the edges. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with the male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable but vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological role highlight its importance in tropical ecosystems.</p>
