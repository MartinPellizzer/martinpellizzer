<p>Acalypha torta, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red-veined sorrel, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking, palmately lobed leaves with a velvety texture and vibrant red veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by reddish-orange seed capsules. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Acalypha torta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha torta has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a velvety texture and a dark green color on the upper surface and lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The stem is slender, with a reddish-brown bark that is smooth when young and becomes rough with age, exhibiting a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and have a yellowish-green color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha torta is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other tropical and subtropical regions around the world. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Acalypha torta typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, its spread in non-native areas has raised concerns about its potential invasive impact.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha torta is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant, papery bracts that create a dramatic visual impact in gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. This fast-growing plant thrives in warm climates and has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season supports healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages bushier foliage. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
