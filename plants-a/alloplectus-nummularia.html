                    <h1>Alloplectus nummularia</h1>
<p>Alloplectus nummularia, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Alloplectus nummularia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments.</p>
