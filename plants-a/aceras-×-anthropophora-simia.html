                <h1>Aceras × anthropophora-simia</h1>
<p>Aceras × anthropophora-simia, commonly known as the hybrid white mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, fuzzy fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The hybrid is a cross between *Aceranthophora* and *Acer simplicifolium*, showcasing genetic diversity in the mulberry family.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aceras × anthropophora-simia has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to lanceolate in shape, dark green on top, and lighter on the underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aceras × anthropophora-simia is a hybrid plant that is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of China, Vietnam, and Myanmar.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to various parts of the world, including parts of Europe and North America, often as an ornamental species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its status as a hybrid and limited natural habitat, it is not currently listed as endangered, but its conservation status remains uncertain due to limited research.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aceras × anthropophora-simia is a hybrid plant known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The growth cycle consists of a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilization in early spring and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aceras × anthropophora-simia is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health through organic matter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Aceras × anthropophora-simia is a hybrid plant with limited known uses primarily in horticulture due to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, some traditional practices may incorporate its leaves for minor purposes. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for potential anti-inflammatory properties, though research remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to the botanical diversity of hybrid plants, supporting ecological and agricultural research.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes the blending of species in botanical gardens, highlighting the importance of genetic diversity in plant conservation.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Aceras × anthropophora-simia has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Briotii' and 'Sensation', which are known for their striking red and orange foliage.</p>
<p>This species is also the parent of several hybrids, such as Acer × carpinifolium, which combines the characteristics of Acer anthophora and Acer simile. These hybrids are often used in horticulture for their unique leaf colors and adaptability to different climates. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a range of conditions and its aesthetic appeal in gardens.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids continue to be popular among plant enthusiasts and landscape designers.</p>
