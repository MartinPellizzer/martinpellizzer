                        <h1>Acacia pervillei var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Acacia pervillei var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of leaflets, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder.</p>
