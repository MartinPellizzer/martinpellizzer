                <h1>Acinodendron verticillatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron verticillatum, commonly known as the clustered acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets arranged in a whorl, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron verticillatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light grey bark that exhibits a slightly rough texture as it ages. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, and have a pale yellow color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensively branched, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron verticillatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forest environments and is commonly found in the understorey of secondary growth and primary rainforests. This plant is also occasionally reported in parts of Southeast Asia, though its presence there is less documented. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with moist, shaded habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become fragmented in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron verticillatum was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, often outcompeting native vegetation. The plant spreads rapidly through its extensive root system and seed production. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns due to its ability to dominate local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on biodiversity.</p>
