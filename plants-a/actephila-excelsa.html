                <h1>Actephila excelsa</h1>
<p>Actephila excelsa, commonly known as the tall actephila, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Actephila excelsa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila excelsa has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale pink, with five petals and a tubular structure, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensively branched, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila excelsa is primarily native to the Andaman Is., Assam, Bangladesh, Borneo, China South-Central, China Southeast, East Himalaya, India, Jawa, Malaya, Myanmar, Nicobar Is., Philippines, Sri Lanka, Sulawesi, Sumatera, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in forested areas with high humidity. It is commonly associated with moist and shaded environments, making it a characteristic component of understory vegetation. The species is widely distributed across Southeast Asia and parts of South Asia.</p>
<p>Its presence in such a broad range highlights its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila excelsa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and prefers well-drained soils. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land clearing and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in some environments.</p>
