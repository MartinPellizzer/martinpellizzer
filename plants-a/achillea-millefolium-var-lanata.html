                <h1>Achillea millefolium var. lanata</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. lanata, commonly known as the lanate yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It is a perennial herb that can reach heights of up to 60 cm.</p>
<p>Its common name is derived from its fluffy, lanate (woolly) foliage, which distinguishes it from other varieties of yarrow.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. lanata has leaves that are finely divided, feather-like, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-white underside due to dense hairs.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, somewhat hairy, and have a light green to grayish color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and colonize new areas.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. lanata is a variant of yarrow that is native to Europe, particularly in regions such as the British Isles, Scandinavia, and parts of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that includes temperate regions of North America, where it has been introduced and naturalized. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from lowlands up to around 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>The conservation status of this variant is generally stable, though it may face threats from habitat loss and invasive species in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. lanata is a hardy perennial that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer, ensuring easy propagation for expanding plantings. The growth cycle of this plant involves a dormant period in winter, with new growth emerging in spring and flowering in late summer. For optimal growth, it requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods, and benefits from a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring.</p>
<p>While generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered, so proper care and companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. lanata is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen for a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also serves as a valuable source of food and shelter for small wildlife, including insects and birds. This plant acts as an effective companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its pest-repelling properties. Additionally, its dense root system helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in various habitats.</p>
<p>Its presence contributes to biodiversity and supports a healthy, balanced ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. lanata is a lesser-known variant of the yarrow plant, known for its medicinal properties and historical significance.</p>
<p>It has been used in traditional medicine to treat wounds, inflammation, and digestive issues due to its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic compounds. While not as commonly used in culinary applications as its standard counterpart, it can be incorporated into herbal teas or infusions. Industrially, it may contribute to the production of natural dyes or as a component in herbal remedies.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes protection and healing, often appearing in folklore and traditional symbolism.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. lanata has several popular cultivars that are widely used in gardens, such as 'Aurea' with its golden foliage and 'Purpurea' known for its purple-tinged leaves.</p>
<p>It also has hybrids that combine traits from different species of the Achillea genus, often resulting in plants with enhanced hardiness and varied coloration. These varieties are prized for their ornamental value, offering both texture and color in landscaped settings. Their horticultural importance lies in their ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and their long blooming period.</p>
<p>They are commonly used in rock gardens, borders, and as ground cover due to their resilience and aesthetic appeal.</p>
