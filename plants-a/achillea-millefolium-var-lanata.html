<p>Achillea millefolium var. lanata, commonly known as woolly yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, silvery-white, woolly foliage, which distinguishes it from the more commonly seen smooth-leaved varieties of yarrow. The plant produces flat, clustered flower heads composed of tiny white to pinkish flowers, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its aromatic leaves and showy flowers make it both ornamental and useful in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
