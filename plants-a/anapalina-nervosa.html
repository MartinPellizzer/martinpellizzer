                    <h1>Anapalina nervosa</h1>
<p>Anapalina nervosa, commonly known as the sensitive fern, is a member of the family Onocleaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are covered in a dense network of root hairs, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. Its leaves are divided into small, lance-shaped segments and are highly sensitive to touch, folding up when disturbed.</p>
<p>Anapalina nervosa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians.</p>
