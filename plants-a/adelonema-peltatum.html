                <h1>Adelonema peltatum</h1>
<p>Adelonema peltatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved mountain mint, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy and have a minty aroma. Its flowers are small, clustered in whorls, and typically pink to purple in color.</p>
<p>Adelonema peltatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelonema peltatum has leaves that are palmately lobed, typically with five to seven lobes, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in diameter. The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, with a simple structure that relies on wind pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema peltatum is primarily native to Colombia and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean regions of these countries. This plant typically grows in high-altitude areas with cool and humid climates. It is often associated with cloud forests and mountainous terrains.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these South American nations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema peltatum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forested areas.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has minimal impact on native ecosystems.</p>
