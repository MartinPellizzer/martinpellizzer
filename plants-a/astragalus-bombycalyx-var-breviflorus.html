<p>Astragalus bombycalyx var. breviflorus, commonly known as the short-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
