<p>Acacia catechu var. baumii, commonly known as the black acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless branches and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing small, dark seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood and for its use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The bark and leaves are also used to produce tannins and have been historically used in dyeing and leather tanning.</p>
