                <h1>Acaena molliuscula</h1>
<p>Acaena molliuscula, commonly known as New Zealand bramble, is a shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prickly stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, round, edible berries that are often used in traditional Māori cuisine. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough, serrated edge.</p>
<p>Acaena molliuscula thrives in a variety of soil types and is adapted to temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acaena molliuscula has compound, alternate leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, measuring approximately 1–2 cm in length, and exhibiting a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and often prostrate or creeping, with a smooth, light green to yellowish bark. It produces small, spherical flowers with five sepals and five petals, typically white or pale yellow, blooming from late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a burr-like achene enclosed in a prickly involucre, which disperses by adhering to animals or through wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena molliuscula is a flowering plant native to New Zealand, specifically found in the southern and western regions of the South Island.</p>
<p>It is now also present in parts of Australia, particularly in Victoria and Tasmania, as a result of human introduction. This species thrives in a variety of environments, including rocky soils, grasslands, and open forests, often growing in sunny or partially shaded areas. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Acaena molliuscula is listed as a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and competition from invasive plants.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acaena molliuscula is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand, known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining the desired characteristics. The growth cycle of Acaena molliuscula is relatively slow, with new growth appearing in spring and flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions to prevent root rot. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in spring, and pruning is recommended to maintain shape and encourage bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with native grasses or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acaena molliuscula is a flowering plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, white flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to soil stability and habitat creation in its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
