<p>Acaena molliuscula, commonly known as the small burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces spherical, prickly fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Acaena molliuscula thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena molliuscula is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury region. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is often associated with coastal and inland dunes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena molliuscula was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its aggressive growth has led to the displacement of native vegetation in many areas.</p>
