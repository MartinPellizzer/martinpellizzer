                    <h1>Acacia acanthoclada</h1>
<p>Acacia acanthoclada, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow or golden flowers in dense, globular inflorescences, which are a key feature for identification. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure.</p>
<p>Acacia acanthoclada is also valued for its role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
