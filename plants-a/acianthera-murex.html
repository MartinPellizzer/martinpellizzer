                <h1>Acianthera murex</h1>
<p>Acianthera murex, commonly known as the spiked acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Acianthera murex is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera murex has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unbranched. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, featuring white petals with a yellowish hue, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera murex is primarily native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions of the island, particularly in forested areas and moist habitats. This orchid species thrives in the tropical climate of Cuba, where it is adapted to the local environmental conditions. It is often seen growing in shaded understory environments within humid forests.</p>
<p>The plant's native range is limited to Cuba, making it a unique component of the island's flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera murex was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates where it can thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures, such as parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant has been introduced to several locations outside its native range, often as an ornamental species due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in new ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, careful monitoring is needed to prevent it from outcompeting native flora.</p>
