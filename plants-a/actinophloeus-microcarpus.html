                <h1>Actinophloeus microcarpus</h1>
<p>Actinophloeus microcarpus, commonly known as the small-fruited actinophloeus, is a member of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus microcarpus has leaves that are simple, ovate, and dark green, with a smooth upper surface and slightly hairy underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and covered with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus microcarpus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and humid lowland areas. This species thrives in shaded undergrowth and is often associated with secondary forest growth. It plays an important role in the ecosystem by providing food and habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the climatic conditions of the region, with a preference for warm and moist environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus microcarpus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
<p>Efforts are now being made to control its population and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
