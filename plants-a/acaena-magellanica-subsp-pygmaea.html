                        <h1>Acaena magellanica subsp. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Acaena magellanica subsp.</p>
<p>pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf bull's-eyes, is a low-growing shrub native to South America. It features small, spiny stems and produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant's fruit is a small, hard achene enclosed in a spiny bract, typical of the genus Acaena. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in maritime climates.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena magellanica subsp.</p>
<p>pygmaea is primarily native to southern South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It is found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the Patagonian steppe and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It is commonly associated with disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to the southern parts of South America, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena magellanica subsp.</p>
<p>pygmaea was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of Acaena species for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is known for its small, spiny fruits and is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats. It has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
