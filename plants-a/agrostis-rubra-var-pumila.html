                    <h1>Agrostis rubra var. pumila</h1>
<p>Agrostis rubra var. pumila, commonly known as the cushion bentgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers, which are typically short-lived. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
