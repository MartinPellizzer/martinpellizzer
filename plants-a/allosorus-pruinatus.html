                    <h1>Allosorus pruinatus</h1>
<p>Allosorus pruinatus, commonly known as the pruinose alpine moss, is a member of the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest floors. The plant has a distinctive silvery or whitish coating on its leaves, which is due to the presence of a pruinose layer composed of fine, powdery cells. This feature helps reduce water loss and protects the moss from excessive sunlight.</p>
<p>Allosorus pruinatus is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
