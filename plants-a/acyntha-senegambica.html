                <h1>Acyntha senegambica</h1>
<p>Acyntha senegambica, commonly known as the Senegambian acyntha, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Acyntha senegambica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acyntha senegambica has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring around 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green to brownish bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha senegambica is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, specifically the countries of Senegal and The Gambia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with riverine forests and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Acyntha senegambica plays an important ecological role in its native range by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha senegambica was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has established populations in regions with suitable climate conditions, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. The plant's adaptability to various soil types has contributed to its spread across different environments. It is often found in disturbed areas, including roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
