<p>Asplenium integerrimum, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in rocky and shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats on limestone or other calcareous substrates, often in moist, shaded areas. Its fronds are usually unifacial, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Asplenium integerrimum is well adapted to nutrient-poor conditions, making it a common sight in crevices and on rock faces in temperate regions.</p>
