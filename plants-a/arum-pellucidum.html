                    <h1>Arum pellucidum</h1>
<p>Arum pellucidum, commonly known as the glassy arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshes in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are glossy and often tinged with red or purple along the veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common colonizer of disturbed wetland areas.</p>
<p>Arum pellucidum plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic insects and serving as a food source for certain wildlife.</p>
