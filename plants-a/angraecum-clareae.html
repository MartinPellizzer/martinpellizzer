                    <h1>Angraecum clareae</h1>
<p>Angraecum clareae, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence bearing numerous fragrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale blue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Angraecum clareae is considered endangered and is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
