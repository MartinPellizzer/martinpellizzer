                <h1>Acronia hispidula</h1>
<p>Acronia hispidula, commonly known as the hairy acronia, is a small flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely hairy leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Acronia hispidula is often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia hispidula has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a rough, hairy texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in dense clusters. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia hispidula is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including parts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal plain regions, particularly in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and swamps. This plant thrives in moist to saturated soils and is often associated with sandy or loamy substrates. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing food and shelter for various insects and small animals.</p>
<p>Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia hispidula was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along trails.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, which are common in these types of locations. The plant's ability to spread rapidly makes it a potential invasive species in regions where it is not native. Its introduction may lead to competition with native flora, altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Therefore, monitoring its spread is important for ecological management.</p>
