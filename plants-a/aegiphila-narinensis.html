                <h1>Aegiphila narinensis</h1>
<p>Aegiphila narinensis, commonly known as the Narin's aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of purple or pink flowers. It typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, preferring well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila narinensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a glossy green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark with a slight fissuring pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>
