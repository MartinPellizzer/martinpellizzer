                    <h1>Ambrosia psilostachya var. coronopifolia</h1>
<p>Ambrosia psilostachya var. coronopifolia, commonly known as the golden crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of yellow to orange ray flowers that resemble a crown, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spiny achenes that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
