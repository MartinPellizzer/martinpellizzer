                    <h1>Amphilophium macrophyllum</h1>
<p>Amphilophium macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved philodendron, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence known as a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant is known for its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, making it a striking addition to indoor and outdoor gardens. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains calcium oxalate crystals, which can be toxic if ingested by humans or pets.</p>
