                    <h1>Agropyron desertorum var. muticum</h1>
<p>Agropyron desertorum var. muticum, commonly known as the desert wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it an important species for stabilizing desert landscapes.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system helps prevent soil erosion and supports biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
