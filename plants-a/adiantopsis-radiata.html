<p>Adiantopsis radiata, commonly known as the star fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that radiate from a central point, giving it a star-shaped appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller segments twice, creating a fine, lacy texture.</p>
<p>Adiantopsis radiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings due to its specific humidity and light requirements.</p>
