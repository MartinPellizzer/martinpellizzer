                    <h1>Ananas macrodontes</h1>
<p>Ananas macrodontes, commonly known as the giant pineapple or mountain pineapple, is a bromeliad native to the humid forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, waxy, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette at the base. The plant produces a single, edible fruit that resembles a pineapple but is much larger and less commonly consumed. Its flowers are typically yellow and bloom at the top of the plant, followed by the development of the fruit.</p>
<p>Ananas macrodontes is well adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
