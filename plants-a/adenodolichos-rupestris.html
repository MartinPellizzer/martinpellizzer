                <h1>Adenodolichos rupestris</h1>
<p>Adenodolichos rupestris, commonly known as the rock bean, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in dry, arid environments.</p>
<p>Adenodolichos rupestris is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos rupestris has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a sprawling or climbing manner. The flowers are pea-like, with a violet-blue corolla and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a legume pod containing small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos rupestris is primarily native to Tanzania and Zambia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry habitats. It is well adapted to the local climate and plays a role in the ecosystem of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Tanzania and Zambia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos rupestris was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and along coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant is often mistaken for native species due to its similar appearance, leading to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental dispersal via human activity or seed transport.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage.</p>
