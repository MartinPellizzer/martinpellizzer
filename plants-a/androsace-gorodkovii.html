<p>Androsace gorodkovii, commonly known as the Siberian snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat.</p>
<p>Androsace gorodkovii is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
