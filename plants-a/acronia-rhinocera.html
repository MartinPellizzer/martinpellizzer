                <h1>Acronia rhinocera</h1>
<p>Acronia rhinocera, commonly known as the horned acronia, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features prominently colored, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>Acronia rhinocera is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky outcrops.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia rhinocera has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are medium in size, dark green on top, and pale underneath.</p>
<p>Its stem is woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin flakes as the plant matures. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with yellow petals and a distinctive red center, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soil conditions and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia rhinocera is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland rainforest environments where it can access ample sunlight and moisture. This plant is commonly found in secondary growth areas and along forest edges, where it adapts well to disturbed habitats. Its distribution is closely tied to the presence of specific soil types and microclimatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its natural range has become increasingly fragmented in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia rhinocera was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, particularly in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it common in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. This plant is often found in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions, where it has established itself in both natural and anthropogenic landscapes. Its introduction has led to its presence in several states, including North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native flora remains largely undocumented.</p>
