                <h1>Acianthera stenzelii</h1>
<p>Acianthera stenzelii, commonly known as the Stenzel's acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives on tree trunks or among foliage. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to other plants without parasitizing them.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique floral structure and coloration make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera stenzelii has narrow, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly wavy margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that exhibits a slight ridging pattern. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in racemes, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera stenzelii is primarily native to Cuba.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical regions of the island, particularly in humid forested areas. It thrives in the warm and moist climate typical of Cuba's interior regions. The plant is often associated with limestone soils and is commonly found in montane habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Cuba.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera stenzelii was mainly introduced to regions with humid climates and well-drained soils, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments, making it suitable for forest understories and shaded garden settings. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and botanical garden exchanges.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in native ecosystems.</p>
