                    <h1>Arenaria aggregata var. suberinacea</h1>
<p>Arenaria aggregata var. suberinacea, commonly known as the clustered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which reduces water loss and enhances its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats.</p>
