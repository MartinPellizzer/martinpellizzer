                <h1>Actinostachys orbicularis</h1>
<p>Actinostachys orbicularis, commonly known as the round-leaf brake, is a fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has distinctive, orbicular (rounded) fronds that are deeply lobed and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Actinostachys orbicularis make it an important species for ecological studies and botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostachys orbicularis has heart-shaped, thick, waxy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in dense clusters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spikes, blooming in late spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind once it matures.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network underground, helping to stabilize the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostachys orbicularis is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the lower Mississippi Valley.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with forested wetland habitats. It is also present in parts of Texas and Louisiana.</p>
<p>Actinostachys orbicularis is an important component of the wetland ecosystems in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostachys orbicularis was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Gulf Coast region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in moist to saturated soils and is often part of the native vegetation in these areas. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and is generally managed as a native species in these regions.</p>
