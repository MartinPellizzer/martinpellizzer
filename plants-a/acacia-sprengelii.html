<p>Acacia sprengelii, commonly known as the red acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow to orange globular inflorescences, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>Acacia sprengelii is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
