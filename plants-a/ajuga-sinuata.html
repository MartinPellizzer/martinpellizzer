                    <h1>Ajuga sinuata</h1>
<p>Ajuga sinuata, commonly known as purple ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly toothed. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread readily, making it a popular groundcover in shaded gardens.</p>
<p>Ajuga sinuata is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
