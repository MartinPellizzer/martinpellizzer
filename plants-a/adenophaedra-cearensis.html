                <h1>Adenophaedra cearensis</h1>
<p>Adenophaedra cearensis, commonly known as the Ceará adenophy, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds.</p>
<p>Adenophaedra cearensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophaedra cearensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy soils and facilitating efficient water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophaedra cearensis is primarily native to Brazil Northeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the northeastern region of Brazil, specifically in the states of Ceará, Piauí, and Pernambuco. This plant thrives in the tropical and subtropical climates of this area. It is commonly found in dry and semi-arid regions with sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely associated with the unique ecological conditions of the northeastern Brazilian landscape.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophaedra cearensis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-modified landscapes, such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and urban environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, tropical climates with moderate rainfall, making it well-suited for regions in South America where it has been documented. This plant is commonly found in Brazil, particularly in the states of Ceará and Piauí, where it has become naturalized. Its ability to grow in poor soil conditions allows it to spread rapidly in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains under study, as it may compete with native vegetation in certain ecosystems.</p>
