                <h1>Aeluropus korshinskyi</h1>
<p>Aeluropus korshinskyi, commonly known as the Korshinsky's grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and the ability to thrive in saline soils.</p>
<p>Aeluropus korshinskyi plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus korshinskyi has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically flat, linear, and arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is short and usually lies close to the ground, with a rough, fibrous texture and a light green to brownish color. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, with a pale green to white color, blooming in the summer months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry seed enclosed in a bract, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb water from the soil.</p>
