                <h1>Achillea sivasica</h1>
<p>Achillea sivasica, commonly known as Sivas yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clustered, small yellow flowers. The plant has feathery, aromatic leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sivasica has leaves that are basal, spoon-shaped, and densely arranged, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, rigid, and covered with a thin, light green bark, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry achene, with small, hairy seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor and spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sivasica is a perennial flowering plant native to Turkey, specifically found in the Sivas Province.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in the eastern part of Turkey, primarily in the Taurus Mountains. This species thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often growing in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Achillea sivasica is considered to be of conservation concern, though it is not yet officially listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea sivasica is a hardy perennial plant native to Turkey, known for its attractive, flat-topped flower heads and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the root clumps in early spring. The growth cycle of Achillea sivasica involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in summer and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions, and it pairs well with companion plants like lavender or echinacea.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea sivasica is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds and foliage for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in herbal gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes and degraded lands.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea sivasica contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea sivasica is a lesser-known plant that has limited documented uses compared to other members of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may have potential for local use in traditional cooking in certain regions. In terms of medicinal properties, preliminary studies suggest it may possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory characteristics, though further research is needed. Its role in industrial and economic contexts is minimal due to its rarity and lack of commercial cultivation.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local traditions, though specific meanings are not well-documented.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea sivasica has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are of interest to horticulturists.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Albiflora' and 'Pallida,' which are valued for their unique floral displays and hardiness. While natural hybrids of Achillea sivasica are less common, some horticultural crosses have been developed to enhance color and adaptability. These plants are appreciated for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in various garden settings.</p>
<p>Their horticultural importance lies in their potential for landscape use and contribution to biodiversity in cultivated environments.</p>
