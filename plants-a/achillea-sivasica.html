<p>Achillea sivasica, commonly known as Sivas yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, showing a preference for well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential healing properties.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sivasica has narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged in a basal rosette, and measure approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and covered with a rough, grayish bark, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and deeply penetrating, helping the plant to anchor itself in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sivasica is primarily native to Turkey.</p>
<p>This species is found in specific regions of Turkey, particularly in the central and eastern parts of the country. It thrives in dry, rocky, and mountainous areas, often in regions with a Mediterranean or continental climate. The plant is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution highlights its ecological significance within the flora of Turkey.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sivasica was mainly introduced to Turkey.</p>
<p>It is native to the region around Sivas, where it grows in rocky and arid environments. The plant has been cultivated in botanical gardens and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its ornamental value. However, it is not widely distributed outside its native range.</p>
<p>Its introduction to new areas is limited and mostly occurs through human activity.</p>
