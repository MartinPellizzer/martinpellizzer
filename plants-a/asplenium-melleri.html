                    <h1>Asplenium melleri</h1>
<p>Asplenium melleri, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. The plant has slender, wiry fronds with a distinctive, narrow shape and a dark green color. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the leaves, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium melleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions.</p>
