                <h1>Adenolinum angustifolium</h1>
<p>Adenolinum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adenolinum, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and has a low, spreading habit. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Adenolinum angustifolium produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, often blooming in spring.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenolinum angustifolium has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branched. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolinum angustifolium is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, including sandy soils and rocky outcrops. This plant thrives in warm, temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is often seen growing in heathlands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the states of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolinum angustifolium was mainly introduced to the western coast of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in California in the early 20th century. The plant was introduced as an ornamental species due to its attractive, narrow leaves. It has since spread along coastal regions, often thriving in sandy soils.</p>
<p>However, it is now considered a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
