                        <h1>Acer cinnamomifolium</h1>
<p>Acer cinnamomifolium, commonly known as the cinnamon-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that resemble the shape of cinnamon leaves, hence its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks in temperate regions.</p>
