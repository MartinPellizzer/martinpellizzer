                <h1>Acer cinnamomifolium</h1>
<p>Acer cinnamomifolium, commonly known as the cinnamon-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that resemble the shape of cinnamon leaves, hence its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks in temperate regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer cinnamomifolium has palmately compound leaves that are broad and ovate, with a smooth, glossy green upper surface and a lighter, fuzzy underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara with a winged seed, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and oval.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cinnamomifolium is a deciduous tree native to eastern China, particularly in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian.</p>
<p>It is now also cultivated in other parts of East Asia, including Korea and Japan, as well as in some botanical gardens worldwide. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate climates, typically found in mountainous regions. It grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Acer cinnamomifolium is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer cinnamomifolium is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with companion plants like lavender or yarrow.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer cinnamomifolium is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land during heavy rains.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, improving air quality and supporting overall ecological health.</p>
