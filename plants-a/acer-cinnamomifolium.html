                        <h1>Acer cinnamomifolium</h1>
<p>Acer cinnamomifolium, commonly known as the cinnamon-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that resemble the shape of cinnamon leaves, hence its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks in temperate regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cinnamomifolium is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in forested areas at higher elevations. This species is particularly associated with the forests of the Himalayas and the northeastern parts of China. It is well adapted to cool, moist environments and often grows in shaded conditions under the canopy of larger trees.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, but it remains most prevalent in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cinnamomifolium was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental tree due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the United States in the early 20th century by horticulturists seeking to diversify the landscape with exotic species. The plant has since been cultivated in gardens and parks across the eastern and central regions of the country. However, it has also shown potential as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution remains largely confined to human-modified landscapes rather than natural habitats.</p>
