                <h1>Acer cinnamomifolium</h1>
<p>Acer cinnamomifolium, commonly known as the cinnamon-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that resemble the shape of a cinnamon leaf, hence its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange samaras in the fall. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and prefers well-drained soils in temperate climates.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree is valued for its vibrant fall color and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer cinnamomifolium has compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with ovate to elliptic leaflets that are typically 5-7 cm long, dark green on top, and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a shrub-like growth pattern. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in cymes during late spring, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cinnamomifolium is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>Although its natural habitat is restricted to these areas, it is now found in a few protected reserves due to habitat loss and overexploitation. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as temperate forests and rocky slopes at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to preserve its dwindling populations, but its survival remains threatened by habitat fragmentation and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer cinnamomifolium is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining the desired traits. The growth cycle of this tree includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer cinnamomifolium is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant also acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of nearby flora by improving soil conditions. Additionally, its deep root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer cinnamomifolium plays a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance in its habitat.</p>
