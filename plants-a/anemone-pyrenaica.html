                    <h1>Anemone pyrenaica</h1>
<p>Anemone pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces showy, white or pale pink flowers with five petals. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Anemone pyrenaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens.</p>
