<p>Atriplex obconica, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well-suited for saline soils and harsh climates.</p>
<p>Atriplex obconica is often used in xeriscaping and for erosion control due to its hardy and resilient growth habit.</p>
