                <h1>Acriopsis javanica</h1>
<p>Acriopsis javanica, commonly known as the Javan thistle, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Its leaves are typically finely divided and aromatic, with a distinctive, somewhat bitter taste.</p>
<p>Acriopsis javanica is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and grasslands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acriopsis javanica has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they vary in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, yellowish-green in color, and arranged in dense, branched clusters; they bloom during the dry season and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis javanica is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and coastal areas. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of southern China and northern Australia.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to humid climates and is often found in open vegetation or along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis javanica was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its striking yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses in countries such as the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
