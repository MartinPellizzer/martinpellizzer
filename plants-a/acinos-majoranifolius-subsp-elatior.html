                <h1>Acinos majoranifolius subsp. elatior</h1>
<p>Acinos majoranifolius subsp.</p>
<p>elatior, commonly known as the greater rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, glandular leaves that are often aromatic.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos majoranifolius subsp.</p>
<p>elatior has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 2â€“5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The stem is slender, hairy, and grows upright, with a greenish-gray bark that becomes woody with age.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in dense heads, and bloom from late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through dry dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos majoranifolius subsp.</p>
<p>elatior is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa. Its current distribution includes areas such as Spain, Portugal, and the Balearic Islands, where it thrives in rocky and limestone soils.</p>
<p>This plant prefers sunny, dry environments and is commonly found in open habitats like scrublands and grasslands. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acinos majoranifolius subsp.</p>
<p>elatior is a hardy perennial herb known for its aromatic foliage and compact growth habit. It can be propagated through seeds or by division of the rootstock, with seed sowing typically done in early spring. This plant has a dormant winter growth cycle, becoming active in spring and producing flowers in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced organic fertilizer in spring supports growth, while light pruning after flowering helps maintain shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like thyme or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acinos majoranifolius subsp.</p>
<p>elatior is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It also attracts beneficial insects and small wildlife that rely on its flowers and seeds for sustenance.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. Additionally, its dense root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas. Acinos majoranifolius subsp.</p>
<p>elatior contributes to ecological balance by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>
