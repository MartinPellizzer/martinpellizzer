<p>Acinos majoranifolius subsp.</p>
<p>elatior, commonly known as the alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its foliage emits a faintly aromatic scent, reminiscent of related members of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
