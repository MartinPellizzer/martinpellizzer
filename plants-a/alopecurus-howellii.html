<p>Alopecurus howellii, commonly known as Howell's hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its fine, hairy texture and is often found in nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
