                    <h1>Agrostis filiformis</h1>
<p>Agrostis filiformis, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in grasslands and along stream banks. The plant has fine, hair-like leaves that are usually less than 2 millimeters in diameter, giving it a delicate appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered at the base of the flowering stems.</p>
<p>Agrostis filiformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
