                <h1>Aconitum leiwuqiense</h1>
<p>Aconitum leiwuqiense, commonly known as the Leiwuqi monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant features palmately lobed leaves and produces toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum leiwuqiense has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is hairy, with a dark brown bark that becomes rough as the plant matures, and it grows upright with a somewhat woody base. The flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with a spurred petal and a five-lobed corolla, blooming in late summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted for anchoring the plant in moist, temperate habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum leiwuqiense is primarily native to Tibet.</p>
<p>This species is found in the mountainous regions of this region. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool and moist conditions. The plant is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Tibet.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum leiwuqiense was mainly introduced to China, where it has been found growing in specific regions with suitable climatic conditions.</p>
<p>This plant is native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cold temperatures. It is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its unique ecological niche, it has not spread widely beyond its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its potential medicinal properties.</p>
