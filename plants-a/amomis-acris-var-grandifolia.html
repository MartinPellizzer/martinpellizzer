                    <h1>Amomis acris var. grandifolia</h1>
<p>Amomis acris var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered arum, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy inflorescence.</p>
<p>The plant features a spadix surrounded by a spathe, which is typically green with a prominent purple or red stripe. It is native to the wetlands and marshes of the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly flies, which are attracted to the plant's strong, often unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>This variant is noted for its robust growth and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in wetland gardens.</p>
