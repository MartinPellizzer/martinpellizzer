                <h1>Adenoncos quadrangularis</h1>
<p>Adenoncos quadrangularis, commonly known as the four-angle adenoncos, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its square-shaped stems, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests.</p>
<p>Its leaves are opposite and have a rough, textured surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoncos quadrangularis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is quadrangular in cross-section, smooth and slightly hairy, with a pale green to reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, with four petals and a yellowish color, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to anchor itself in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoncos quadrangularis is primarily native to Jawa and Sumatera.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of these islands. It thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is often associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to the western part of Indonesia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoncos quadrangularis was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in roadside embankments and along railway tracks. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for reclamation projects. Its rapid growth and dense foliage help prevent soil erosion and reduce sediment runoff.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
