<p>Aspidium pectinatum, commonly known as the veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are often submerged or floating in still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread across the water's surface. Its leaves are typically divided into small, pinnate segments, giving it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Aspidium pectinatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
