<p>Aspidium crinigerum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
