                    <h1>Atriplex laevis var. patens</h1>
<p>Atriplex laevis var. patens, commonly known as the silverleaf chenopod, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces clusters of greenish-yellow flowers that are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>Atriplex laevis var. patens is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor, saline conditions.</p>
