                    <h1>Aquarius major</h1>
<p>Aquarius major, commonly known as the giant water star, is a striking aquatic plant characterized by its large, star-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically bright green with a waxy texture, allowing them to remain buoyant and capture sunlight efficiently. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, which develop into fruiting bodies that release seeds into the water.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in ornamental water gardens.</p>
