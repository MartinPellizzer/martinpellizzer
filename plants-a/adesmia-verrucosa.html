                <h1>Adesmia verrucosa</h1>
<p>Adesmia verrucosa, commonly known as the woolly legume, is a flowering plant species native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes many leguminous plants known for their nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Adesmia verrucosa is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia verrucosa has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, exhibiting a creeping growth pattern that often forms dense mats. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia verrucosa is primarily native to Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean regions of the country. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and high-altitude areas. It is often associated with semi-arid and tropical highland environments.</p>
<p>Adesmia verrucosa is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia verrucosa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, small, yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several tropical and subtropical regions, spreading through seed dispersal by wind and water. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and coastal areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to concerns about its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is still cultivated in some areas for its ornamental value.</p>
