                <h1>Acer monspessulanum</h1>
<p>Acer monspessulanum, commonly known as the Spanish maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, grey bark. The tree produces palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind.</p>
<p>The Spanish maple is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a rounded shape and a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, typically measuring 5–10 cm in length and width, and displaying a vibrant green during the growing season, turning yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, rocky soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum is a rare and ancient tree species native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically found in southern Spain and southwestern Portugal.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited, it is now cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections across Europe and North America. It thrives in dry, sunny environments with well-drained soils, often growing in rocky or limestone-rich areas. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted natural habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer monspessulanum is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p>
