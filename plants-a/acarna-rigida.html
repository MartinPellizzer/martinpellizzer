                <h1>Acarna rigida</h1>
<p>Acarna rigida, commonly known as the rigid acarna, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>Acarna rigida thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acarna rigida has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is rigid and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acarna rigida is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within these regions due to habitat fragmentation and environmental changes. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as rocky slopes and forest understories. Acarna rigida is typically found at altitudes ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acarna rigida is a hardy perennial plant known for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms that add color to gardens throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer, ensuring a robust and healthy plant. The growth cycle of Acarna rigida begins in spring with new shoots, followed by flowering in mid-summer, and it enters a dormant phase in late fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote continuous blooms.</p>
<p>Common pests include aphids and slugs, while diseases like powdery mildew can occur in humid conditions, making companion planting with marigolds or lavender helpful for natural pest control.</p>
