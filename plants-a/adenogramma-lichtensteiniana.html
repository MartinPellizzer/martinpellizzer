                <h1>Adenogramma lichtensteiniana</h1>
<p>Adenogramma lichtensteiniana, commonly known as the Lichtenstein's adenogramma, is a small shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it prefers well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Adenogramma lichtensteiniana is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenogramma lichtensteiniana has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unbranched until reaching maturity. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white to pale pink petals, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma lichtensteiniana is primarily native to the Cape Provinces of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the region's fynbos biome, which is known for its rich biodiversity. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops and sandy soils. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the area, characterized by dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Adenogramma lichtensteiniana is a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma lichtensteiniana was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in fynbos vegetation, thriving in sandy soils and coastal areas. This plant is known for its attractive, showy flowers that bloom in spring. It has been introduced to several botanical gardens and conservation areas for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
