                    <h1>Agave coerulescens</h1>
<p>Agave coerulescens, commonly known as the blue agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing white or pale green flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The blue agave is also notable for its use in the production of tequila, though it is not the most commonly used species for this purpose.</p>
