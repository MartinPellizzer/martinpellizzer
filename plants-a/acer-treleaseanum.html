                <h1>Acer treleaseanum</h1>
<p>Acer treleaseanum, commonly known as the Trelease maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking orange-red foliage in autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length, with a serrated margin. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer treleaseanum has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface and lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a shrub-like growth pattern. The plant produces small, clustered yellow-green flowers in early spring, with a simple structure and wind as the primary pollination method. Its fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer treleaseanum is a rare tree species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited, with only a few known populations surviving in fragmented habitats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within evergreen forests, often found along riverbanks or in valley floors. This species typically grows at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer treleaseanum is classified as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to prevent its extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer treleaseanum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer treleaseanum includes a period of slow growth in early spring, followed by rapid development during the summer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and annual pruning to maintain shape and promote airflow are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with shrubs and perennials for a diverse garden landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer treleaseanum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil stability. Its roots help prevent erosion by holding soil in place, especially on slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer treleaseanum contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer treleaseanum is a lesser-known maple species primarily found in specific regions of Southeast Asia, known for its unique ornamental value and ecological role.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and sap may have local traditional uses in some indigenous communities. In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports local ecosystems, which can have economic benefits through ecotourism and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain areas, representing resilience and natural beauty in local folklore and art.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer treleaseanum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Orange Crown,' which are known for their vibrant autumn foliage. The species has been hybridized with other maple species to create cultivars with enhanced color and growth habits. These hybrids are particularly popular in horticulture for their ability to thrive in a variety of climates.</p>
<p>Due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability, Acer treleaseanum and its hybrids hold significant horticultural importance in landscape design.</p>
