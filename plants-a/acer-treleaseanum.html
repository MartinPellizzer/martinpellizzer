                <h1>Acer treleaseanum</h1>
<p>Acer treleaseanum, commonly known as the Trelease maple, is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are typically bright green during the growing season. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer treleaseanum has compound leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with ovate to elliptic leaflets that are usually 5â€“10 cm in length, featuring a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to anchor the tree in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer treleaseanum is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Although its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including greenhouse collections in Europe and North America. It thrives in moist, shaded environments with well-drained soil, typically found in temperate forests. This species grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer treleaseanum is a unique maple species known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer treleaseanum involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer treleaseanum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of plant and animal life. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by improving soil quality and offering habitat for numerous organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer treleaseanum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>It has potential medicinal applications due to its bioactive compounds, which may possess anti-inflammatory or antioxidant properties. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and ecological stability, supporting wildlife and soil health. Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in local communities, representing resilience or natural beauty.</p>
<p>However, its role in economic applications remains underexplored due to its rarity and limited cultivation.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer treleaseanum has a limited number of naturally occurring varieties, but it is more commonly known for its cultivated forms and hybrids.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame', which are prized for their vibrant fall color. These cultivars are often used in ornamental landscaping due to their aesthetic appeal. Hybrids of Acer treleaseanum have been developed to enhance traits such as disease resistance and growth habits.</p>
<p>Overall, the plant holds horticultural importance as a source of color and form in garden settings.</p>
