<p>Aniba rosodora f. typica, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, dark-green leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is highly sought after in the musical instrument and furniture industries.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
