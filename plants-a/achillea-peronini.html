                <h1>Achillea peronini</h1>
<p>Achillea peronini, commonly known as the Peronini yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its narrow, silver-green leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, pale yellow to white flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>Achillea peronini is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea peronini has narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly reddish in color, with a branching growth pattern that becomes more compact as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, composite structures with yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in dry, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea peronini is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and southern France. It thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy environments, often growing in open grasslands and along coastal cliffs. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Achillea peronini is considered a species of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea peronini is a low-growing perennial plant known for its bright yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a cool-season growth cycle, blooming in early to mid-summer and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, with watering only needed during prolonged dry periods. Fertilization is best done in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in poorly drained soil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its appearance and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea peronini is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering both nectar and shelter within its foliage. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence.
