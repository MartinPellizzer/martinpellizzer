                <h1>Achillea peronini</h1>
<p>Achillea peronini, commonly known as the Peronini yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea peronini has basal leaves that are lanceolate, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disc flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene, with a pappus that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish itself in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea peronini is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and dry habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and gravelly areas. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. It is often associated with Mediterranean scrublands and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific ecological zones within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea peronini was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and stabilize slopes in agricultural and construction areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and roadside environments where it thrives in full sun. The plant is known for its ability to colonize bare ground quickly, making it effective for land reclamation projects. However, its aggressive growth can lead to the displacement of native vegetation if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in many regions where it was introduced.</p>
