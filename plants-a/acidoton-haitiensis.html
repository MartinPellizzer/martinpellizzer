                <h1>Acidoton haitiensis</h1>
<p>Acidoton haitiensis, commonly known as Haitian acidoton, is a flowering plant native to Haiti.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and glossy, dark green leaves. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidoton haitiensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows in a climbing or shrub-like pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidoton haitiensis is primarily native to Haiti.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the mountainous areas. It thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing in forest understories. The species is endemic to Haiti, meaning it is not found naturally anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a unique part of Haiti's biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidoton haitiensis was mainly introduced to the island of Hispaniola, where it has since become an integral part of the local flora.</p>
<p>This plant was introduced as part of ecological restoration efforts to enhance biodiversity in degraded habitats. It is now found growing in both natural and human-altered environments across the region. Its introduction has contributed to the recovery of certain ecosystems by providing habitat and food sources for native wildlife.</p>
<p>However, its spread has also raised concerns about potential competition with native species.</p>
