                    <h1>Aspalathus quinquefolia</h1>
<p>Aspalathus quinquefolia, commonly known as African green tea, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate or quinquefoliate leaves, which consist of three to five leaflets, and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Its leaves are harvested and processed to produce a caffeine-free herbal tea, valued for its antioxidant properties and unique flavor.</p>
<p>Aspalathus quinquefolia plays an important role in both ecological systems and the local economy through its commercial cultivation.</p>
