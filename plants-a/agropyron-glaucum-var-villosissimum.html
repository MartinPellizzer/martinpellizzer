<p>Agropyron glaucum var. villosissimum, commonly known as the woolly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive, woolly appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and its potential use in restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
