                    <h1>Agrostis stolonifera var. marina</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonifera var. marina, commonly known as beach grass, is a coastal plant adapted to sandy and salty environments.</p>
<p>It forms dense, low-growing mats that stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like flowers. It is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind, making it a key species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its stolons allow it to spread rapidly and colonize new areas along shorelines.</p>
