<p>Abies minuta, commonly known as the dwarf fir, is a small evergreen conifer native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and short, stiff needles that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and it flowers with male and female cones on the same tree. Abies minuta thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found growing in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
