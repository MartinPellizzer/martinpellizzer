                    <h1>Asplenium yunnanense var. daraeiforme</h1>
<p>Asplenium yunnanense var. daraeiforme, commonly known as the Yunnan spleenwort, is a rare and specialized fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky crevices or along forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are clustered in small, rounded clusters on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution.</p>
