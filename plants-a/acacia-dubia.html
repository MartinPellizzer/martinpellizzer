                    <h1>Acacia dubia</h1>
<p>Acacia dubia, commonly known as the ghost acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, feathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Acacia dubia is well adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
