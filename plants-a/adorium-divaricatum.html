                <h1>Adorium divaricatum</h1>
<p>Adorium divaricatum, commonly known as the silverleaf spirea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adorium divaricatum has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adorium divaricatum is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, specifically regions in Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in lowland areas near rivers and along forest edges. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various local wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, its natural range has become increasingly restricted.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adorium divaricatum was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, particularly in regions with warm climates.</p>
<p>It has been documented in several tropical and subtropical areas, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in both natural and disturbed habitats. Due to its invasive potential, it is now considered a threat to native plant communities in some regions.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to monitor and control its spread.</p>
