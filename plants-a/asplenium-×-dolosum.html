                    <h1>Asplenium × dolosum</h1>
<p>Asplenium × dolosum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore cases called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on spore dispersal for propagation.</p>
