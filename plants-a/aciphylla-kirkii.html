                    <h1>Aciphylla kirkii</h1>
<p>Aciphylla kirkii, commonly known as the Kirk's ice plant, is a low-growing, succulent shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fleshy, spiny leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences at the ends of its stems. Its adaptations to harsh, alpine conditions make it a hardy species often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Aciphylla kirkii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates in its native range.</p>
