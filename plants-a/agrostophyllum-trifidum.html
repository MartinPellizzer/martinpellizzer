                    <h1>Agrostophyllum trifidum</h1>
<p>Agrostophyllum trifidum, commonly known as the three-lobed lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits distinct botanical features.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus with a finely divided, lobed structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which contributes to its unique morphology and survival strategies. It typically grows on tree bark and rocks in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its intricate thallus structure and chemical composition make it an important subject in lichenology and ecological studies.</p>
