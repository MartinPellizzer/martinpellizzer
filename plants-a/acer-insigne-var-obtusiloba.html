                <h1>Acer insigne var. obtusiloba</h1>
<p>Acer insigne var. obtusiloba, commonly known as the Sierra maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red foliage in the fall, which makes it a striking ornamental plant. The leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer insigne var. obtusiloba has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a broad base and rounded tips, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, turning bright red in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The flowers are inconspicuous, with small greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer insigne var. obtusiloba is a rare plant native to the eastern Himalayas, primarily found in countries such as Bhutan, India, and Nepal.</p>
<p>While its native range was once broader, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the eastern Himalayan region. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically growing in mountain forests at elevations between 1,800 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, it is considered endangered, with conservation efforts ongoing to protect and restore its populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer insigne var. obtusiloba is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant fall foliage and unique leaf shape.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a slow initial development, followed by rapid growth in its second and third years, reaching maturity within 10-15 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally pest and disease resistant, though it may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer insigne var. obtusiloba is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and promoting the growth of other plant species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and protecting against water runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in carbon sequestration, supporting overall environmental balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer insigne var. obtusiloba is a lesser-known species of maple with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>It has been historically valued in some indigenous cultures for its potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. While not widely used in industrial applications, it contributes to local biodiversity and ecosystem health. Its ornamental value makes it a candidate for horticultural use in landscaping.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in regions where it naturally occurs, though detailed records of its symbolic roles are sparse.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer insigne var. obtusiloba has several popular cultivars that are favored for their unique foliage and ornamental value, such as 'Aconitifolium' and 'Kelseyi'.</p>
<p>These cultivars are often selected for their vibrant autumn colors and compact growth habits. Hybrids of this variety have been developed to enhance traits like cold hardiness and disease resistance, making them more adaptable to different climates. Horticulturally, Acer insigne var. obtusiloba is important for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids contribute to the diversity of maple trees used in ornamental horticulture worldwide.</p>
