                <h1>Adicea betulifolia</h1>
<p>Adicea betulifolia, commonly known as the birchleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that resemble those of birch trees, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streams.</p>
<p>Adicea betulifolia is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea betulifolia has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 3 to 8 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough and fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with yellowish-green petals, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are tiny, dry, and adapted for aerial dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea betulifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and some Pacific islands.</p>
<p>Adicea betulifolia is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea betulifolia was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forest edges, stream banks, and disturbed sites where it can establish quickly. The plant is valued for its ornamental value due to its delicate foliage and clusters of small white flowers. However, it has shown invasive tendencies in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to control its spread and minimize ecological impact.</p>
