<p>Aethulia, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking, waxy leaves with a silvery-blue hue that reflect light, giving it a unique appearance. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white or pale yellow. Aethulia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities.</p>
