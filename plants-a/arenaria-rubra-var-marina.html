                    <h1>Arenaria rubra var. marina</h1>
<p>Arenaria rubra var. marina, commonly known as sea sandspur, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments where it helps stabilize the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh coastal climates and is often used in coastal restoration projects.</p>
