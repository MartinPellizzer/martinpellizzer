                <h1>Acinodendron tenue</h1>
<p>Acinodendron tenue, commonly known as the slender acinodendron, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible.</p>
<p>Acinodendron tenue is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along streambanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tenue has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 2â€“4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, growing upright with some branching. The flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tenue is primarily native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments within lowland forests and mountainous areas. This plant is commonly found in secondary forests and along forest edges where it can receive partial sunlight. It is also present in parts of southern Arabia and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tenue was mainly introduced to areas with suitable tropical and subtropical climates, often as an ornamental plant or for horticultural purposes.</p>
<p>It has been found in regions such as Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Americas where it thrives in warm, humid environments. The distribution is primarily concentrated in coastal and lowland areas with well-drained soils. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses due to its attractive foliage and adaptability.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native regions.</p>
