<p>Asplenium lewisense, commonly known as the Lewis's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and woodland soils. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly curled. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
