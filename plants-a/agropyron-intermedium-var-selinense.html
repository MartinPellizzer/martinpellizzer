                    <h1>Agropyron intermedium var. selinense</h1>
<p>Agropyron intermedium var. selinense, commonly known as the desert wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed environments.</p>
