                    <h1>Athrotaxis selaginoides var. pyramidata</h1>
<p>Athrotaxis selaginoides var. pyramidata, commonly known as the pyramidated tallowwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the wet tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its narrow, conical crown and dark, glossy foliage. The plant exhibits a unique growth form with a pyramidal shape, which helps it withstand strong winds and heavy rainfall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a leathery texture and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its hard, durable timber, though its conservation status remains vulnerable due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
