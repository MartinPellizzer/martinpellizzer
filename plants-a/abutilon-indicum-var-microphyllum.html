<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are pendulous, with a velvety calyx and five pink to reddish-purple petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>
