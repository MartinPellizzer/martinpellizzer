<p>Arenaria procera subsp.</p>
<p>pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sand-arene, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Its subspecific name, *pubescens*, refers to the fine, hairy covering on its stems and leaves.</p>
