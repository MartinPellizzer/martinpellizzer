<p>Atriplex patula subsp.</p>
<p>patula, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal areas of western North America. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to tolerate saline and arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils and withstand drought.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize coastal dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
