                    <h1>Asplenium pedicularifolium</h1>
<p>Asplenium pedicularifolium, commonly known as the hanging spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are clustered at the base, forming a rosette, and are characterized by their narrow, linear shape with a finely toothed margin. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium pedicularifolium is often found in forested areas and is adapted to nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
