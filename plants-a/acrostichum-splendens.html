                <h1>Acrostichum splendens</h1>
<p>Acrostichum splendens, commonly known as the golden fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their striking appearance.</p>
<p>Acrostichum splendens is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in indoor settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum splendens has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers clustered in spikes, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-sided capsule that disperses its seeds by wind once it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum splendens is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, swamp forests, and along riverbanks where there is high humidity and abundant moisture. This plant thrives in wetland environments and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. It is also present in parts of eastern Australia and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can occasionally be found in disturbed or secondary growth habitats within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum splendens was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, shiny, and dark green foliage.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in humid environments. The plant is known for its adaptability to various soil types and its tolerance to partial shade, making it a popular choice for landscaping. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impact in regions where it is not native.</p>
