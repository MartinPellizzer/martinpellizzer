                    <h1>Apatostelis standleyi</h1>
<p>Apatostelis standleyi, commonly known as the Standley's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, adapted to attract specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
