<p>Asplenium normaloides, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Asplenium normaloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
