                <h1>Acer subobtusum</h1>
<p>Acer subobtusum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens. It typically grows to a height of 6â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Its flowering season occurs in early spring, producing small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer subobtusum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a rounded base, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and moderately deep, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer subobtusum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, primarily found in China, Vietnam, and Laos.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific areas within these countries, with the majority of populations concentrated in the northern and western parts. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in dense forests with rich, well-drained soil. It grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer subobtusum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer subobtusum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining cultivar traits. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by summer growth and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lavender or marigold can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer subobtusum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity and enhancing soil stability. Its extensive root system helps prevent erosion, particularly in moist or wetland environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer subobtusum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
<p>Its bark and leaves have been explored for potential medicinal properties, though research is still in early stages. In industrial applications, it contributes to the broader maple tree industry, which provides timber and syrup production. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in regions where it grows, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and aesthetic than utilitarian in traditional senses.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer subobtusum has several notable cultivars, including 'Crimson King' and 'Coral Sunset', which are prized for their striking autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It is also frequently used in hybridization to create new maple varieties with enhanced ornamental traits. Hybrid forms often combine the hardiness of Acer subobtusum with the vibrant coloration of other maple species. These hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their adaptability and visual appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer subobtusum plays a significant role in the development of ornamental maples due to its genetic versatility and aesthetic qualities.</p>
