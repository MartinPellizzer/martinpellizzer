                <h1>Acer subobtusum</h1>
<p>Acer subobtusum, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree has alternate, ovate leaves with rounded to slightly notched bases and a distinctive silvery-white underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by red to orange berries.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer subobtusum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a rounded base, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruits are samaras with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer subobtusum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The species is considered endangered due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer subobtusum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining specific cultivar traits. The growth cycle of Acer subobtusum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by leaf development and flowering in summer, and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization should be done in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, while pruning is best done in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead or diseased branches. Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while diseases like leaf spot and anthracnose may occur, requiring prompt treatment.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lavender or marigold can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer subobtusum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local pollination ecosystem. The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its deep roots help in erosion control by holding the soil in place during heavy rains.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer subobtusum plays a role in maintaining the overall health of its habitat by supporting a diverse range of plant and animal life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer subobtusum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in traditional medicine for its bark and leaves, which contain compounds believed to have anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in local economies, particularly in regions where it is harvested for ornamental purposes or as a source of timber. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some indigenous communities, representing resilience and connection to the land. While not widely used in industrial applications, its presence in forest ecosystems contributes to biodiversity and ecological balance.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer subobtusum's role is more ecological and cultural than commercial.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer subobtusum has a limited number of naturally occurring varieties, but it is not widely cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Some popular cultivars include 'Crimson Queen' and 'Orange Queen', which are appreciated for their vibrant autumn foliage. While it is not commonly hybridized, it has been used in crosses with other maple species to create unique hybrids with enhanced ornamental traits. These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and more striking leaf colors, contributing to their horticultural importance in temperate gardens.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer subobtusum remains a valuable species for both its ecological role and potential in horticultural breeding programs.</p>
