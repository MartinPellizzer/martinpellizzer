<p>Arabidella trisecta var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited three-lobed bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three lobes that are often submerged, and the flowers are small and inconspicuous.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its short, compact fruits, which set it apart from other varieties within the species.</p>
