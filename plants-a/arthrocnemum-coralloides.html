<p>Arthrocnemum coralloides, commonly known as the coral tree of the desert, is a halophytic shrub adapted to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive branching pattern that resembles coral, giving it its common name. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and help it survive in extreme conditions. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Arthrocnemum coralloides plays a vital role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing soil erosion in desert ecosystems.</p>
