                <h1>Aechmea hoekelii</h1>
<p>Aechmea hoekelii, commonly known as the Hoekel's bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its foliage is typically broad and waxy, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Aechmea hoekelii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea hoekelii has rosette-shaped leaves that are stiff, grass-like, and arranged in a compact circle, typically measuring 30–60 cm in length and 5–10 cm in width, with a waxy blue-green color.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, with the leaves directly supporting the inflorescence, and the base of the rosette forms a tight, compact structure. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix-like structure surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically pink or red, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and beetles. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to store water, helping the plant survive in dry environments.</p>
