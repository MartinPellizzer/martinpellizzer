                <h1>Aechmea subintegerrima</h1>
<p>Aechmea subintegerrima, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of stiff, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with colorful bracts, often in shades of pink, red, or orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity.</p>
<p>Aechmea subintegerrima is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea subintegerrima has rosette-shaped leaves that are stiff, sword-like, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a dark green color and a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, and its growth is primarily through the expansion of the leaf rosette. It produces inflorescences with spadices that bear small, white to greenish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer and are pollinated by wind or insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means, and the plant has fibrous roots that help anchor it in its habitat.</p>
