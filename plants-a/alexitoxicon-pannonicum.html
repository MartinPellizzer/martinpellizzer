                    <h1>Alexitoxicon pannonicum</h1>
<p>Alexitoxicon pannonicum, commonly known as the Pannonian poison ivy, is a flowering plant native to the Pannonian Basin in Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often toxic properties. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a smooth margin and produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters. Its roots and leaves contain irritants that can cause dermatitis in humans, similar to the effects of poison ivy.</p>
<p>Despite its harmful effects, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain insects and birds.</p>
