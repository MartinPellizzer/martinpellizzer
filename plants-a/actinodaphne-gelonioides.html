                <h1>Actinodaphne gelonioides</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne gelonioides, commonly known as the Malabar ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne gelonioides has elliptical to ovate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exudes a fragrant resin when cut. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers with greenish-white petals, blooming during the dry season, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne gelonioides is primarily native to the Indo-Pacific region, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, typically within humid evergreen forests. Its distribution includes countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is often associated with limestone soils and is part of the laurel family, Lauraceae.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne gelonioides was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in lowland tropical rainforests and secondary growth habitats. This plant is commonly used in traditional medicine for its aromatic leaves and resin. Its introduction has been associated with both ecological and economic benefits in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to competition with native species in invaded ecosystems.</p>
