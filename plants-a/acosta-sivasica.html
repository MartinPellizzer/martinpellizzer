                <h1>Acosta sivasica</h1>
<p>Acosta sivasica, commonly known as the Sivasica acosta, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth texture and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acosta sivasica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta sivasica has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta sivasica is primarily native to the highland regions of central Chile, specifically in the Andean foothills and valleys.</p>
<p>It is found in the area encompassing the provinces of Maule, Ñuble, and part of the Biobío region. This species typically grows in dry to semi-arid environments with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with rocky slopes and scrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in this part of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta sivasica was mainly introduced to areas with suitable climatic conditions, including regions with moderate temperatures and adequate rainfall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in disturbed or degraded habitats. This plant has been reported in several countries in South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile. Its introduction is often associated with human activity, such as land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to limited research on its distribution and effects on native flora.</p>
