                    <h1>Aira cespitosa var. humilis</h1>
<p>Aira cespitosa var. humilis, commonly known as slender false wheat, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along trails.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
