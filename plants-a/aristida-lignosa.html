                    <h1>Aristida lignosa</h1>
<p>Aristida lignosa, commonly known as rigid wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Aristida lignosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats.</p>
