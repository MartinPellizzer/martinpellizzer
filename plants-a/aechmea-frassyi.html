                    <h1>Aechmea frassyi</h1>
<p>Aechmea frassyi, commonly known as the Foxtail Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiky rosette of grass-like leaves that form a central cup, known as a rosette, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aechmea frassyi is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests.</p>
