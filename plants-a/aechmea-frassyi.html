                <h1>Aechmea frassyi</h1>
<p>Aechmea frassyi, commonly known as the Foxtail Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiky rosette of grass-like leaves that form a central cup, known as a rosette, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aechmea frassyi is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea frassyi has rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow, strap-like, and arranged in a tight spiral around the plant's central axis, with a waxy, bright green surface and a silvery underside.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, instead having a short, compact rosette structure with a dense, fibrous root system that anchors it firmly in the soil. It produces inflorescences with clustered, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animal consumption.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and adapted for efficient water absorption in its natural habitat.</p>
