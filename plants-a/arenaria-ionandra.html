<p>Arenaria ionandra, commonly known as the Ionandra sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, adding delicate beauty to its arid habitat. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in loose, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Arenaria ionandra is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
