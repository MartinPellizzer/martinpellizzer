                <h1>Acourtia mexicana</h1>
<p>Acourtia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and fleshy, green stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Its adaptations to dry environments include thick leaves and a shallow root system.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia mexicana has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth and somewhat woody. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming from spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to thrive in arid and rocky environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia mexicana is primarily native to Mexico Northeast and Mexico Northwest.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Acourtia mexicana is well adapted to the dry climate and seasonal rainfall patterns of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia mexicana was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a ornamental plant due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in disturbed soils and outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and mitigate its environmental effects.</p>
