<p>Asclepias variegata var. minor, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green markings. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive, horn-like structures called horns. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for its larvae.</p>
<p>Its milkweed sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many herbivores but beneficial for certain pollinators.</p>
