                <h1>Actephila megistophylla</h1>
<p>Actephila megistophylla, commonly known as the giant leaved actephila, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila megistophylla has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered with a smooth, light brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to efficiently absorb nutrients and water from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila megistophylla is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments like forests and mountainous areas. This plant is commonly associated with humid climates and is typically found at elevations ranging from lowland to mid-elevation forests. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to biodiversity and supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of suitable microhabitats and climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila megistophylla was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has been documented in parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as in the Pacific Islands. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and abandoned agricultural lands. Its introduction is likely due to human activity, including trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely unstudied.</p>
