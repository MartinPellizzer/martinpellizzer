                    <h1>Aletris lutea f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Aletris lutea f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered yellow ginseng, is a rare and striking variant of the yellow ginseng plant.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China and Korea. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and a compact, low-growing habit.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts.</p>
