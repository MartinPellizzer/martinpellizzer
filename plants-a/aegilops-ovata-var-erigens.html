                    <h1>Aegilops ovata var. erigens</h1>
<p>Aegilops ovata var. erigens, commonly known as the erect spikelet wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant produces narrow, linear leaves and has a fibrous root system adapted to arid conditions. Its seeds are encased in tough, protective glumes, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
