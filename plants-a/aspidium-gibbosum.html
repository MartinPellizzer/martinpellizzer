<p>Aspidium gibbosum, commonly known as the knobbed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and swampy areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium gibbosum is notable for its ability to thrive in wetland habitats and its distinctive, knob-like structures on the fronds.</p>
