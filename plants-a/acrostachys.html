                    <h1>Acrostachys</h1>
<p>Acrostachys, commonly known as the false orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically small, herbaceous, and often grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks. They are characterized by their compact, often clustered growth habit and their showy, orchid-like flowers. Acrostachys species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structures and their role in the diverse ecosystems they inhabit.</p>
