                <h1>Aconitum × bartokianum nothosubsp. sooanum</h1>
<p>Aconitum × bartokianum nothosubsp.</p>
<p>sooanum, commonly known as the Bartokianum soolanum hybrid, is a hybrid plant within the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and striking, large, blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow environments. It produces showy, spurred flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is toxic and requires careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum × bartokianum nothosubsp.</p>
<p>sooanum has large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, and have a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. The stem is erect, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures.</p>
<p>The flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with spurred petals and a complex structure that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, blooming in late summer. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum × bartokianum nothosubsp.</p>
<p>sooanum is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia, particularly in China, Korea, and Japan. Its current distribution includes cultivated areas and some naturalized sites in temperate regions around the world.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shady or semi-shade environments, often found in woodlands or along streambanks. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin and limited natural habitat, it is considered a conservation concern, with some populations facing threats from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum × bartokianum nothosubsp.</p>
<p>sooanum is a striking perennial known for its tall, spire-like flowers and dark green foliage. It can be propagated through seeds or division, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>This plant has a cool season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune dead foliage in late fall to encourage healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract slugs and aphids; companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aconitum × bartokianum nothosubsp.</p>
<p>sooanum is a striking perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its dense foliage offers shelter and habitat for small insects and ground-dwelling wildlife.</p>
<p>It acts as a companion plant in garden ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and attracting a variety of beneficial organisms. While it does not fix nitrogen, its deep root system helps with erosion control in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>Overall, it contributes to ecological balance by supporting pollinators and providing structural habitat in woodland and garden settings.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Aconitum × bartokianum nothosubsp.</p>
<p>sooanum is a hybrid plant primarily valued for its ornamental qualities, often cultivated in gardens for its striking blue or purple flowers. It has limited culinary use due to the presence of toxic alkaloids, making it unsuitable for consumption.</p>
<p>While it has no significant medicinal applications, its natural compounds have been studied for potential pharmaceutical research. Culturally, it is appreciated in horticulture for its aesthetic value and is sometimes used in symbolic gardens to represent beauty and danger.</p>
<p>Economically, it contributes to the ornamental plant industry, supporting garden centers and botanical trade.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
