                    <h1>Arceuthobium cyanocarpum</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium cyanocarpum, commonly known as the blueberry dodder, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of blueberry plants.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, where it can significantly weaken the host plant.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
