                <h1>Adenia stenophylla</h1>
<p>Adenia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf adenium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Passifloraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its woody, succulent stem and large, heart-shaped leaves. It produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive crown of bracts, which are often mistaken for petals.</p>
<p>Adenia stenophylla is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia stenophylla has elliptical,革质 (leathery) leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brownish-gray in color, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with yellow petals and a greenish calyx, blooming from September to November, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia stenophylla is primarily native to the tropical regions of eastern and northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the rainforests and moist understory habitats of Queensland and New South Wales. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and partial shade, often growing along streamlines and in rocky outcrops. Its distribution is also recorded in some parts of New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>Adenia stenophylla is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia stenophylla was mainly introduced to regions with moist, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens and greenhouses. The plant is often found in the understorey of rainforests, where it receives indirect sunlight. Its introduction has been noted in several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of Australia.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated for both horticultural and ecological purposes.</p>
