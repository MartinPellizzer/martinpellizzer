                <h1>Adiantum parvulum</h1>
<p>Adiantum parvulum, commonly known as the small maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, bright green fronds that resemble the feathers of a bird, giving it its common name. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>Adiantum parvulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens as a shade-loving plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum parvulum has fern-like leaves that are fan-shaped, arranged in a rosette, and typically measure around 5â€“10 centimeters in diameter, with a dark green color and finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>The stem is short and unbranched, with a smooth, slender texture and a light green color, growing upright from the base. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a cluster of tiny, dry seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum parvulum is primarily native to the eastern United States, including states such as Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands, stream banks, and rocky areas. The plant is commonly associated with the southeastern Appalachian region and is well adapted to humid climates. It is also found in parts of eastern Mexico, particularly in the states of Chiapas and Oaxaca.</p>
<p>Adiantum parvulum is a small fern that prefers well-drained soil and is often seen growing in clusters on rocks or along the edges of water bodies.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum parvulum was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This fern has become naturalized in many areas, often forming dense colonies along the edges of water bodies. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through human activity, including garden plantings and accidental dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has spread beyond its original range, sometimes becoming invasive in certain regions.</p>
