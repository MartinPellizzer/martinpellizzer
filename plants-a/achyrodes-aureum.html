                <h1>Achyrodes aureum</h1>
<p>Achyrodes aureum, commonly known as the golden sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its small, clustered flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrodes aureum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with yellow petals and orange stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrodes aureum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often associated with coastal and mangrove ecosystems in its native range.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some parts of its distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrodes aureum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in sandy soils along the shoreline, often in disturbed or abandoned areas. This plant is considered an invasive species in some parts of its range due to its rapid spread and competitive nature. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental transport via maritime activities.</p>
<p>It poses a threat to native plant communities by outcompeting them for resources.</p>
