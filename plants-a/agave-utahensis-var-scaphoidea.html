<p>Agave utahensis var. scaphoidea, commonly known as the Utah agave, is a perennial succulent native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, blue-gray to green, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a white, powdery coating called farina. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
