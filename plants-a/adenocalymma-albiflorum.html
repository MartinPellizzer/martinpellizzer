<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma albiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma albiflorum has leaves that are simple, elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in racemes, with five petals and stamens, blooming during the winter months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma albiflorum is primarily native to Brazil Northeast and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the northeastern and southeastern regions of Brazil. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical environments within these areas. The species is adapted to the warm and humid climate of these regions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific parts of Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma albiflorum was mainly introduced to the southern regions of South Africa, particularly in the Cape Floristic Region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as fynbos vegetation. The plant is characterized by its small, white flowers and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. It has adapted well to the local climate and requires minimal water once established.</p>
