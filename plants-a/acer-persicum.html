                <h1>Acer persicum</h1>
<p>Acer persicum, commonly known as the Persian maple, is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental foliage, which turns vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree typically grows to a height of 8–15 meters, featuring a spreading crown and smooth, gray bark. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a serrated margin, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The fruit is a paired samara, which disperses seeds by wind, aiding in its natural propagation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer persicum has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, displaying a vibrant green on the upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree with a spreading crown. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in corymbs, which bloom in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer persicum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited and fragmented, with isolated populations in its native range. It thrives in temperate climates, typically growing in dry, rocky soils at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, Acer persicum is classified as endangered by the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer persicum is a decorative tree known for its vibrant red leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seed propagation requiring stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acer persicum includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lavender or marigold can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer persicum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The tree also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other flora in its vicinity. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer persicum offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat diversity in forested areas.</p>
