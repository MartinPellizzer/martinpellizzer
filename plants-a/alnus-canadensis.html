                    <h1>Alnus canadensis</h1>
<p>Alnus canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian black alder, is a deciduous tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval leaves and clusters of yellowish-green catkins. The tree is adapted to moist environments, often found in wetlands, streambanks, and along rivers. Its root system forms extensive symbiotic associations with nitrogen-fixing actinomycetes, which enhance soil fertility.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed sites.</p>
