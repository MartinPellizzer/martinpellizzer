<p>Arapatiella trepocarpa, commonly known as the rock fig, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its woody structure and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, inedible fruits that are encased in a fleshy, spiny capsule, which is adapted for dispersal by animals. Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies.</p>
