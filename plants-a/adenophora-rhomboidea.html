                <h1>Adenophora rhomboidea</h1>
<p>Adenophora rhomboidea, commonly known as the rhombic bellflower, is a perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora rhomboidea has alternate, lanceolate leaves that are typically 2-5 cm long and 1-2 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and grows upright with a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and range from pale blue to purple, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora rhomboidea is primarily native to eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates and moist environments. This plant typically grows in mountainous areas and forested regions. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Adenophora rhomboidea is often seen in alpine meadows and rocky slopes throughout its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora rhomboidea was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and areas with moderate moisture levels. This plant has spread to various regions outside its native range, including parts of North America. Its adaptability to different environmental conditions has contributed to its successful establishment.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native flora.</p>
