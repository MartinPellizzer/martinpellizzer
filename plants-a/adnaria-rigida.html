                <h1>Adnaria rigida</h1>
<p>Adnaria rigida, commonly known as the rigid sea holly, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the family Goodeniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves, which are adapted to withstand the harsh conditions of coastal environments. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom during the summer months. It is typically found in rocky intertidal zones and shallow marine habitats.</p>
<p>Adnaria rigida plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria rigida has leaves that are simple, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a greyish-brown bark that is smooth when young but becomes rough and fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy, upright pattern. The plant produces small, white flowers with four petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria rigida is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas, often found on rocky shores and among seaweed beds. This plant is commonly associated with shallow marine environments, particularly in areas with moderate to strong wave action. Its distribution includes countries such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey.</p>
<p>Adnaria rigida is an important species in the intertidal zone, contributing to the ecological balance of these habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria rigida was mainly introduced to coastal and brackish water environments in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, warm waters with moderate salinity levels. This plant is commonly found in estuaries, lagoons, and tidal zones where it forms dense underwater vegetation. Its introduction has led to changes in local ecosystems by altering water flow and sedimentation patterns.</p>
<p>Adnaria rigida is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
