                <h1>Acianthera omissa</h1>
<p>Acianthera omissa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has long, narrow leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera omissa has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a glossy dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered with a smooth, pale green bark, exhibiting a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with a white to pale pink color, and bloom during the summer months; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera omissa is primarily native to Venezuela.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the northern and central parts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories. The plant is known for its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Its restricted native range highlights its ecological significance within Venezuelan biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera omissa was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as abandoned fields, roadsides, and forest edges. This plant thrives in environments with partial to full sunlight and is often seen growing along stream banks and in rocky outcrops. Its introduction has been documented in several parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
