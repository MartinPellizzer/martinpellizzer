<p>Arthropteris submarginalis, commonly known as the marginal huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often divided into segments with a marginal vein. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Arthropteris submarginalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
