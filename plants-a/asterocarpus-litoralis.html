<p>Asterocarpus litoralis, commonly known as the coastal asterocarpus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, herbaceous growth habit and is often found in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. It is adapted to salt-laden environments and can tolerate periodic inundation by tidal waters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
