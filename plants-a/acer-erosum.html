                    <h1>Acer erosum</h1>
<p>Acer erosum, commonly known as the smooth maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its striking, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.</p>
<p>Acer erosum is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges.</p>
