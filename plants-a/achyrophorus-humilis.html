                <h1>Achyrophorus humilis</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus humilis, commonly known as the low achyranthes, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually hairy and adapted to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense spikes, often with five petals.</p>
<p>It is known for its resilience to drought and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus humilis has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, creeping, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is prostrate or ascending. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, blooming in early summer, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its habitat in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus humilis is primarily native to the central and northern regions of North America, specifically in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with wetland ecosystems. Its distribution extends from the northeastern United States through parts of the Midwest and into southern Canada.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that plays an important role in its native ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus humilis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to low moisture and full sun exposure. This plant is often found in regions with temperate climates and is commonly associated with human-altered landscapes. Its introduction has been linked to accidental dispersal through agricultural activities and transportation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in many parts of the world.</p>
