<p>Ajuga ciliata, commonly known as carpet bugle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens.</p>
