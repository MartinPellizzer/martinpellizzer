                <h1>Acrocarpidium hispidulum</h1>
<p>Acrocarpidium hispidulum, commonly known as the hairy acrocarp, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features narrow, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental foliage, it is a popular choice among gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocarpidium hispidulum has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exhibits a slightly twisted growth pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with tubular structures, typically pinkish-red in color, blooming in late spring and early summer, and is primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind, with small, light seeds that are easily carried by the air.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpidium hispidulum is primarily native to the temperate regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils. This plant is commonly associated with scrublands and dry forests, where it adapts well to low rainfall and high temperatures. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches that provide the necessary conditions for its growth.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpidium hispidulum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, including horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, gardens, and vacant lots. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a concern in some regions where it outcompetes native flora.</p>
