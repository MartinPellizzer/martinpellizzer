                <h1>Acer cappadocicum subsp. lobelii</h1>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>lobelii, commonly known as the Cappadocian maple, is a deciduous tree native to Turkey. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are typically green on top and greyish-white underneath.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>lobelii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to rocky and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>lobelii is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey, particularly in the Cappadocia area. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the eastern part of the country.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates, often found in rocky soils and open forests. This subspecies typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>lobelii is a unique maple species known for its ornamental value and adaptability. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>The growth cycle includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning should be done in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead wood.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like aphids or fungal infections, and it pairs well with flowering shrubs and perennials in the garden.</p>
