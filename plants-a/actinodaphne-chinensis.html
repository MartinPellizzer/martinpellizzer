                <h1>Actinodaphne chinensis</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne chinensis, commonly known as Chinese camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and fragrant wood. The plant is known for its high camphor content, which gives it medicinal and industrial uses. It typically grows in humid, lowland forests and can reach heights of up to 20 meters.</p>
<p>The tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne chinensis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 8â€“15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exudes a fragrant resin when damaged. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dark purple drupe containing one or two seeds, dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne chinensis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, India, and parts of Indochina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland forests and hill areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils, often growing in shaded undergrowth. It is particularly common in the southern provinces of China, such as Guangdong and Guangxi.</p>
<p>Its native distribution also extends to the Andaman Islands and the Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne chinensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa. The plant is often found in shaded to semi-shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or garden settings. Its introduction has also been linked to horticultural trade and traditional medicine practices.</p>
<p>However, its spread in non-native areas requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
