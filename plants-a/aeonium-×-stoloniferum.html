                    <h1>Aeonium × stoloniferum</h1>
<p>Aeonium × stoloniferum, commonly known as the "Tree Aeonium," is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern, with thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces offsets and stolons, which allow it to spread and form dense clumps. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Aeonium × stoloniferum is popular in rock gardens and as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
