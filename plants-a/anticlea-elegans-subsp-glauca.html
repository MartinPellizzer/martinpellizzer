<p>Anticlea elegans subsp.</p>
<p>glauca, commonly known as the blue antclea, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery blue or grayish bloom.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of botanical circles.</p>
