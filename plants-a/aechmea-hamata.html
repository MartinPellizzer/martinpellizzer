<p>Aechmea hamata, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces showy inflorescences with colorful bracts that range from red to pink, often resembling a pineapple in appearance.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
