                <h1>Acroceras calcicola</h1>
<p>Acroceras calcicola, commonly known as the limestone buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to calcareous soils in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white waxy coating. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single cluster at the top of the stem, with five petals and numerous stamens.</p>
<p>It is adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroceras calcicola has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough texture and a light green to brownish color, growing upright and branching sparsely. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical dispersal when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky soil in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras calcicola is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>This unique plant is found in specific regions of the island, particularly in limestone-rich habitats. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are important to protect its natural habitat from degradation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras calcicola was mainly introduced to areas with calcareous soils, particularly in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. This plant thrives in environments with moderate moisture and full sun exposure. Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
