                    <h1>Amorphophallus arnautovii</h1>
<p>Amorphophallus arnautovii, commonly known as the giant tiger mushroom, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its large, leafy stems and distinctive inflorescence. The plant produces a striking, reddish-purple spadix surrounded by a spathe, which resembles a flower but is actually a modified leaf. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is known for its rapid growth and short life cycle.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it faces significant conservation challenges.</p>
