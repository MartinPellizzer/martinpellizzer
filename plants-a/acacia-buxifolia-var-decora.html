<p>Acacia buxifolia var. decora, commonly known as the decorative boxwood acacia, is a variant of the boxwood acacia species.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its dense, foliage that resembles that of boxwood, giving it a compact and ornamental appearance. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters.</p>
<p>The leaves are small, leathery, and evergreen, contributing to its aesthetic appeal in horticultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia buxifolia var. decora has small, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 1 to 3 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, vertical strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are clustered in spherical inflorescences, featuring bright yellow petals and stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by birds and insects. The fruit is a woody pod that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, forming a dense network near the soil surface to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia buxifolia var. decora is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Although its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of Africa and the Caribbean, where it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is typically found in lowland areas with well-drained soils. This species usually grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to approximately 500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted natural habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia buxifolia var. decora is a compact, ornamental shrub known for its dense foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster and more reliable results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 3 to 5 years, making it suitable for both container and in-ground cultivation.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage dense branching. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like sedum or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
