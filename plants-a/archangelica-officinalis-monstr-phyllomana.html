<p>Archangelica officinalis monstr.</p>
<p>phyllomana, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, with a distinctive reddish stem covered in coarse hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in late summer, which are followed by cylindrical, greenish-brown fruits. It is known for its strong, unpleasant odor and contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature and potential for harm, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
