<p>Aegiphila farinosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or sand verbena, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Aegiphila farinosa is often used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
