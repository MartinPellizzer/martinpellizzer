                <h1>Aegiphila farinosa</h1>
<p>Aegiphila farinosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or sand verbena, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Aegiphila farinosa is often used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila farinosa has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving them a grayish-white color.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, woody, and has a rough, fissured bark. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soils it inhabits.</p>
