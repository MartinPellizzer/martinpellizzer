                <h1>Acronychia lobocarpa</h1>
<p>Acronychia lobocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acronychia, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia and parts of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that contain a single seed. It is typically found in coastal rainforests and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia lobocarpa has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a globose, woody drupe, containing one or two seeds, which are dispersed by animals through endozoochory.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia lobocarpa is primarily native to the eastern and northern parts of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests and coastal areas of these regions. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with lowland and mountainous rainforest habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia lobocarpa was mainly introduced to the eastern and southeastern regions of Australia, particularly in coastal and semi-arid areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and disturbed sites, often growing as a shrub or small tree. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate poor soil quality. It is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has minimal impact on native ecosystems.</p>
