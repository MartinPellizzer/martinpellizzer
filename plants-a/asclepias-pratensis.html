                    <h1>Asclepias pratensis</h1>
<p>Asclepias pratensis, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America.</p>
<p>It features erect, slender stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers with distinctive, horn-like structures called horns. Its milkweed sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but serves as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Showy milkweed is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species.</p>
