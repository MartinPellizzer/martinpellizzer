                <h1>Acroceras ivohibense</h1>
<p>Acroceras ivohibense, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the tropical rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow or white with intricate patterns. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status remains poorly understood.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroceras ivohibense has leaves that are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras ivohibense is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>This unique plant is found in specific regions of the island, particularly in the northeastern part of the country. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest undergrowth. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are important to protect its natural habitat from threats such as deforestation and climate change.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras ivohibense was mainly introduced to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. The plant is native to Southeast Asia but has been introduced to new environments, including Madagascar. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings.</p>
<p>Its introduction may have ecological implications due to its potential to invade native vegetation.</p>
