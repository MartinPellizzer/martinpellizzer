                <h1>Acroblastum spicatum</h1>
<p>Acroblastum spicatum, commonly known as the spiky acroblast, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features narrow, spiny leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acroblastum spicatum is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroblastum spicatum has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is mostly upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in spiky inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroblastum spicatum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. This plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often associated with disturbed or transitional habitats. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroblastum spicatum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and land development.</p>
<p>It has been documented in regions where it was not originally native, including parts of North America and Europe. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in these environments. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor its spread and assess its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
