<p>Armeria maritima var. linkii, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has gray-green, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture and withstand harsh coastal conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, cliffs, and rocky shores.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal environments.</p>
