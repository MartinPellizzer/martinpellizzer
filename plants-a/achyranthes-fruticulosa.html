                <h1>Achyranthes fruticulosa</h1>
<p>Achyranthes fruticulosa, commonly known as red sandalwood, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect or decumbent stems, which are often reddish in color, and its alternate, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is cultivated in some regions for its aesthetic and practical benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes fruticulosa has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a somewhat woody texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with a greenish-white color, blooming from June to September, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes fruticulosa is a plant native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly found in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>It is now also distributed in parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. This species thrives in moist, tropical environments such as forests and wetlands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Achyranthes fruticulosa is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not at immediate risk of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyranthes fruticulosa is a hardy perennial plant commonly grown for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing established clumps, with seeds typically sown in early spring. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, going through active growth in spring and summer, followed by a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages new shoots.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally be affected by aphids or root rot, and it benefits from companion planting with marigolds or lavender to deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achyranthes fruticulosa is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its clusters of small, pinkish flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil fertility through its growth habits.</p>
