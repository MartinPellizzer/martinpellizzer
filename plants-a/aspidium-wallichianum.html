                    <h1>Aspidium wallichianum</h1>
<p>Aspidium wallichianum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. Native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in wet soil.</p>
<p>The plant's spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
