<p>Agrostis rupestris subsp.</p>
<p>pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny grains.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, high-altitude habitat.</p>
