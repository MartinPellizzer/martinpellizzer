                <h1>Adnaria pinifolia</h1>
<p>Adnaria pinifolia, commonly known as the pineleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that resemble pine needles, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Adnaria pinifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria pinifolia has needle-like leaves that are linear, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and range in length from 2 to 5 centimeters, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers with yellow stamens and a greenish-pink pistil, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains one seed, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria pinifolia is primarily native to the Mediterranean Basin, including regions such as southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, rocky shores, and saline soils along the Mediterranean coast. This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained environments and is often associated with maritime climates. Its distribution includes countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey.</p>
<p>Adnaria pinifolia is an important component of coastal vegetation in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria pinifolia was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as accidental transport via shipping or intentional planting for ornamental or ecological purposes.</p>
<p>It has established itself in coastal and estuarine environments, often thriving in brackish water conditions. The plant's rapid growth and ability to tolerate varying salinity levels contribute to its successful spread in these areas. It is now considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
