                <h1>Acrostichum lanuginosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum lanuginosum, commonly known as the silky fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that give it a soft, silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>Acrostichum lanuginosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is appreciated for its unique texture and foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lanuginosum has broad, leathery leaves that are typically lance-shaped, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and measure up to 30 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and sturdy, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that has a fibrous texture, and it grows in dense clumps. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, and they are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps anchor it in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lanuginosum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, swamps, and along riverbanks where there is abundant moisture. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. Its native range extends from Mexico through the Caribbean to northern South America.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in the southern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lanuginosum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, feathery foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and wetlands where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. This plant has been reported in several countries including the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread in non-native habitats.</p>
