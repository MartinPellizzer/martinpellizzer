                    <h1>Avicennia nitida</h1>
<p>Avicennia nitida, commonly known as the slender mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and tidal environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas, including mudflats, estuaries, and mangrove forests, where it tolerates high salt concentrations. The plant has aerial roots that help in gas exchange and provide structural support. Its small, elliptical leaves are thick and waxy, reducing water loss in salty conditions.</p>
<p>Avicennia nitida plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
