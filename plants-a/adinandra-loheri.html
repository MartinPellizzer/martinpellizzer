                <h1>Adinandra loheri</h1>
<p>Adinandra loheri, commonly known as the Malabar ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within tropical forests. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries.</p>
<p>Adinandra loheri is valued for its durable timber and is also of ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra loheri has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and measure approximately 5-8 cm in length, with a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures.

<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the southern islands. This plant typically grows in lowland and montane forests. It is often associated with secondary vegetation and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the archipelago.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra loheri was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens and as an ornamental plant. This plant has been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in local ecosystems, outcompeting native flora.</p>
