                    <h1>Astragalus macrophysus var. robustus</h1>
<p>Astragalus macrophysus var. robustus, commonly known as the robust milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinator populations.</p>
