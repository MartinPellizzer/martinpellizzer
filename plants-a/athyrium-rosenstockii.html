                    <h1>Athyrium rosenstockii</h1>
<p>Athyrium rosenstockii, commonly known as the Rosenstock's lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or pendulous. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Athyrium rosenstockii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
