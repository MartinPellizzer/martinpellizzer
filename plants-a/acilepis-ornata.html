                <h1>Acilepis ornata</h1>
<p>Acilepis ornata, commonly known as the ornate acilepis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, yellow, and orange. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Acilepis ornata is often found in rocky habitats and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis ornata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and measure approximately 5-8 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and has a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils and helping it absorb nutrients from the environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis ornata is primarily native to India.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southern regions of the country, particularly in the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories. It is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
<p>Acilepis ornata plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insect species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis ornata was mainly introduced to areas with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It has been reported in regions of southern Africa, including South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana, where it thrives in Mediterranean-type climates. The plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, often growing in coastal or inland areas with limited rainfall. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
