                <h1>Achyranthes sandwicensis</h1>
<p>Achyranthes sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian nettle, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its upright growth habit and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal forests and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes sandwicensis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, smooth, and green, with a tendency to branch out at the base. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and typically yellow or greenish-yellow, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>
