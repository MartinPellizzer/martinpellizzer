                <h1>Acrospelion rigidum subsp. teberdense</h1>
<p>Acrospelion rigidum subsp.</p>
<p>teberdense, commonly known as the Teberda rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Eastern Balkans. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, mat-forming foliage that thrives in rocky and limestone substrates.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species, often found in isolated populations within its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrospelion rigidum subsp.</p>
<p>teberdense has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds by wind after maturity.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrospelion rigidum subsp.</p>
<p>teberdense is a rare plant species native to the eastern Mediterranean region, particularly Turkey. Its current distribution is limited to a few specific locations in the Taurus Mountains.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is commonly found in open, sunny habitats. The species typically grows at altitudes between 1,200 and 1,800 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acrospelion rigidum subsp.</p>
<p>teberdense is a rare and unique plant that thrives in specific environmental conditions. It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing established clumps, with seed propagation requiring stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle of this plant is slow, with active growth occurring during the spring and early summer months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, sandy soils and requires consistent but not excessive watering to prevent root rot. Fertilization should be minimal, using a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is limited to removing dead or damaged foliage. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like sedums or lavender can enhance its growth and provide beneficial microclimates.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acrospelion rigidum subsp.</p>
<p>teberdense is a unique plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for local pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It also attracts birds and small mammals that feed on its seeds, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. Additionally, it plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes the soil.</p>
<p>Its presence offers ecological benefits by supporting a variety of wildlife and maintaining the balance of its native environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acrospelion rigidum subsp.</p>
<p>teberdense is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses and applications. It is primarily of interest in botanical research due to its unique ecological niche and potential for genetic diversity.</p>
<p>While there is no widespread culinary use for this species, it may hold promise for future medicinal studies due to its potential bioactive compounds. Its role in local ecosystems suggests it could be important for maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
<p>However, due to a lack of extensive research, its industrial, economic, or cultural significance remains largely unexplored.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acrospelion rigidum subsp.</p>
<p>teberdense has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability. Popular cultivars include 'Albiflorum' and 'Variegatum', which are appreciated for their unique foliage and flowering characteristics.</p>
<p>Hybrids involving this subspecies are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and bloom duration. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in diverse conditions, making it a favored choice for gardeners in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal and resilience, it remains a significant plant in both landscape design and botanical collections.</p>
