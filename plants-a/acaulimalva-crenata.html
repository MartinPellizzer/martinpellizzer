                <h1>Acaulimalva crenata</h1>
<p>Acaulimalva crenata, commonly known as the hairy willow herb, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate leaves with wavy, serrated edges.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and roadside areas. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fuzzy, hairy texture on both leaves and stems is a distinguishing feature, providing it with a unique appearance.</p>
<p>Acaulimalva crenata is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other flowering plants such as hibiscus and cotton.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acaulimalva crenata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and are usually pubescent beneath. The stem is slender and creeping, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanging throughout the plant's life. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with five pink to purple petals and yellow stamens, blooming from spring to early summer and pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaulimalva crenata is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as southern France, Spain, Portugal, and the western coast of North Africa. It thrives in dry, rocky environments, often growing on slopes or in limestone soils. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Acaulimalva crenata is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acaulimalva crenata is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and showy, pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in a cold frame during late winter. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in spring and early summer before going dormant in hot weather.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and consistent moisture, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune dead foliage after flowering to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>
