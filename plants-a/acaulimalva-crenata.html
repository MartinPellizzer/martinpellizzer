                        <h1>Acaulimalva crenata</h1>
<p>Acaulimalva crenata, commonly known as the hairy willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have wavy edges, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Acaulimalva crenata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acaulimalva crenata belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malvales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have showy flowers and are often associated with cotton and hibiscus. Its family is Malvaceae, commonly known as the mallow family, which includes plants with five-petaled flowers and a variety of ecological and economic significance. Its genus is Acaulimalva, a group of flowering plants characterized by their specific morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>
<p>Its species is Acaulimalva crenata, a particular type within this genus, distinguished by its unique leaf shape and habitat preferences.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaulimalva crenata is primarily native to Peru.</p>
<p>It is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas. This plant is adapted to the cooler and drier climates of these regions. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to specific ecological zones within Peru.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaulimalva crenata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, temperate climates and spreads rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread.</p>
