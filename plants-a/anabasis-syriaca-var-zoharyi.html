                    <h1>Anabasis syriaca var. zoharyi</h1>
<p>Anabasis syriaca var. zoharyi, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>This species is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone habitats.</p>
