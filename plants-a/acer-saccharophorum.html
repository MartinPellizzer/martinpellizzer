<p>Acer saccharophorum, commonly known as the sugar maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, developing shallow furrows with age.</p>
<p>The sap of the sugar maple is well-known for being tapped to produce maple syrup.</p>
