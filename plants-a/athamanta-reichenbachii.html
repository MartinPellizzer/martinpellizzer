<p>Athamanta reichenbachii, commonly known as the Reichenbach's rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Athamanta reichenbachii is often found in high-altitude regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
