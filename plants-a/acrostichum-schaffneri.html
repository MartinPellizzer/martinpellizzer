<p>Acrostichum schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum schaffneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
