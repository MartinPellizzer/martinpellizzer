                <h1>Acer circumlobatum</h1>
<p>Acer circumlobatum, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and clusters of white flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning vibrant red in the fall.</p>
<p>The Pacific madrone is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer circumlobatum has leaves that are palmately lobed, typically with five to seven lobes, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually green during the growing season and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer circumlobatum is a species of maple native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas along the Pacific coast, particularly in the coastal ranges and valleys. This plant thrives in moist, temperate environments with well-drained soil, often growing near streams or in forested areas. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 100 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Acer circumlobatum is listed as a species of concern in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer circumlobatum is a unique maple species known for its striking, flame-like foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity over several years, making it ideal for small spaces.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from scale insects or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sage can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer circumlobatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through improved soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer circumlobatum supports ecological balance by offering habitat and resources throughout different seasons.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer circumlobatum is a species of maple tree native to South America, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and sap may have minor traditional uses in local communities.
