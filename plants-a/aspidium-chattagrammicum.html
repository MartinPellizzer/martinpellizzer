<p>Aspidium chattagrammicum, commonly known as the Chittagong water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has long, slender fronds that are often submerged or floating, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in wetland ecosystems.</p>
