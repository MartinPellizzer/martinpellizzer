                    <h1>Athyrium gillespiei</h1>
<p>Athyrium gillespiei, commonly known as the Gillespie's fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
