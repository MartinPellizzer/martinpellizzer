                    <h1>Aetheorhiza montana</h1>
<p>Aetheorhiza montana, commonly known as the mountain lichen, is a species of foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leaf-like thallus, which is typically green or yellowish in color. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, enabling it to photosynthesize. It is often found on tree trunks, rocks, and soil in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to air pollution, it is considered an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
