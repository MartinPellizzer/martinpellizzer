                    <h1>Acourtia dugesii</h1>
<p>Acourtia dugesii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woolly, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss, and it produces a milky sap that is toxic to some animals.</p>
<p>Acourtia dugesii plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies.</p>
