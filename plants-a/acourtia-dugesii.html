                <h1>Acourtia dugesii</h1>
<p>Acourtia dugesii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woolly, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss, and it produces a milky sap that is toxic to some animals.</p>
<p>Acourtia dugesii plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia dugesii has small, narrow, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-gray upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia dugesii is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in regions with specific climatic and soil conditions that support its growth. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and adequate sunlight. The distribution of Acourtia dugesii is closely linked to its ecological requirements and historical range.</p>
<p>It is an important species within its native habitat, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia dugesii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and abandoned pastures.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and full sunlight. This plant is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. Its introduction has led to its spread in both natural and human-altered environments.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
