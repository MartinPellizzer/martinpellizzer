                    <h1>Ajuga reptans</h1>
<p>Ajuga reptans, commonly known as carpet bugle or ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, often with a mint-like aroma.</p>
<p>Ajuga reptans is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to suppress weeds in woodland settings.</p>
