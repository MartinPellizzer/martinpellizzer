<p>Andropogon pseudauriculatus, commonly known as the false earleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often tinged with purple or reddish tones. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet environments, it is often used in restoration projects aimed at reclaiming degraded wetlands.</p>
