                <h1>Acer cinerascens f. longipes</h1>
<p>Acer cinerascens f. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed smoke tree, is a cultivar of the smoke tree species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, feathery, pinkish-white inflorescences that appear in early spring. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree is valued for its ornamental foliage and unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer cinerascens f. longipes has elongated, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a shrub-like growth pattern. The small, inconspicuous flowers are greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed capsule, which disperses by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cinerascens f. longipes is a rare maple variant native to the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it is now cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections around the world. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, typically found in forest understories. It is commonly found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer cinerascens f. longipes is a striking ornamental maple known for its unique elongated leaves and vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or groundcovers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer cinerascens f. longipes is a unique plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. This plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing the growth of surrounding flora. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and improving water retention.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports ecological benefits by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer cinerascens f. longipes is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>It has potential medicinal applications due to its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, though further research is needed. Industrially, it is not widely utilized, but its wood may have niche applications in specialty crafts or furniture. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in certain regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its role remains largely ornamental and ecological, contributing to biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer cinerascens f. longipes has a limited number of recognized cultivars, with 'Coral Bells' being one of the most popular for its vibrant red foliage.</p>
<p>It is occasionally hybridized with other maple species, though such hybrids are relatively rare in horticultural practice. The plant's unique coloration and compact growth make it a valuable addition to specialty gardens and botanical collections. Its horticultural importance lies in its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is often sought after by plant enthusiasts and nurseries specializing in rare and unusual maples.</p>
