                <h1>Adinandrella africana</h1>
<p>Adinandrella africana, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its thick, rough bark and large, palmate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by round, woody fruits containing a fatty seed kernel. The seeds are widely used for their high oil content, which is valuable in cosmetics and food products.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats and is also culturally significant to local communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandrella africana has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often branching, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in panicle-like inflorescences, blooming during the rainy season, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal ingestion and excretion.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandrella africana is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist lowland forests and along riverbanks, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. This species is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia, where it grows in similar ecological conditions. Its natural range extends across the African continent, with a preference for areas with rich, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adinandrella africana plays an important role in local ecosystems and has traditional uses in various African communities.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandrella africana was mainly introduced to regions where its natural habitat has been fragmented due to human activities.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields. This plant has adapted well to these new environments, often thriving in areas with poor soil quality. Its introduction has led to changes in local ecosystems, sometimes outcompeting native species.</p>
<p>The distribution of Adinandrella africana is now widespread in parts of Africa, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
