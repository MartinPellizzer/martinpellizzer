                    <h1>Angraecum urschianum</h1>
<p>Angraecum urschianum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and unique species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance, which attracts specific pollinators like moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
