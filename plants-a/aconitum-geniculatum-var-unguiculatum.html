<p>Aconitum geniculatum var. unguiculatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a tall, unbranched stem with palmately divided, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.</p>
