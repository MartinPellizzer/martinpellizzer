<p>Asplenium × nieschalkii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium ruta-muraria.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Asplenium × nieschalkii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
