                    <h1>Aristida adscensionis var. strictiflora</h1>
<p>Aristida adscensionis var. strictiflora, commonly known as the narrow-flowered threeawn, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences composed of closely spaced, awned lemmas. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in dry open areas. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from other Aristida species by its more compact inflorescence and reduced floral structure.</p>
