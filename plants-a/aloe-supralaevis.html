<p>Aloe supralaevis, commonly known as the smooth aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with yellow flowers, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is sometimes used for its soothing properties.</p>
<p>Aloe supralaevis is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
