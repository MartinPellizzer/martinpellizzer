<p>Atragene repens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>Atragene repens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
