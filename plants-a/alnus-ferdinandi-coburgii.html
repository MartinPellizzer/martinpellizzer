<p>It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval leaves and catkin-like flowers. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across rocky and well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
