                <h1>Acinodendron neurotrichum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron neurotrichum, commonly known as the velvetleaf acacia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with small, lance-shaped leaflets that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, it is often considered an invasive species in certain areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron neurotrichum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron neurotrichum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forests and is commonly found in areas with rich biodiversity. The plant is often associated with secondary growth forests and is adapted to the warm, moist climate of these regions. It plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron neurotrichum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fern-like foliage.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread to other tropical regions. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to monitor and manage its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
