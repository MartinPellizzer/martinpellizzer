                    <h1>Acinodendron neurotrichum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron neurotrichum, commonly known as the velvetleaf acacia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with small, lance-shaped leaflets that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, it is often considered an invasive species in certain areas.</p>
