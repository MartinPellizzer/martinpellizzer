                    <h1>Acacia clementii</h1>
<p>Acacia clementii, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of whitish hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact spikes, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Acacia clementii is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
