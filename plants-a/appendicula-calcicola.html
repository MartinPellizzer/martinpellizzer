                    <h1>Appendicula calcicola</h1>
<p>Appendicula calcicola, commonly known as the limestone appendicula, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions with calcareous soils.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
