                        <h1>Acacia decaisnei</h1>
<p>Acacia decaisnei, commonly known as the Decaisne's acacia, is a shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow, spherical flowers that are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Acacia decaisnei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia decaisnei is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry deciduous forests and spiny forests of the island. This species is adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat. It is commonly found in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Acacia decaisnei plays an important ecological role in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia decaisnei was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and adequate sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and degraded forests. This plant has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, where it has become naturalized. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions have contributed to its spread.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature and potential impact on native vegetation.</p>
