                <h1>Acer zarei</h1>
<p>Acer zarei, commonly known as the Zarei maple, is a species of deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.</p>
<p>The Zarei maple produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that disperse its seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer zarei has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a maple-like shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant red or orange in the autumn. The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's natural habitat in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer zarei is a rare tree species native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Himalayas, primarily found in countries like India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>Although its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to isolated populations in these mountainous areas. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, typically found in temperate forests. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer zarei is classified as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer zarei is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer zarei includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally suffer from aphids or leaf spot, and it benefits from companion planting with plants that improve soil health, such as comfrey or clover.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer zarei is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer zarei plays a role in carbon sequestration, helping to mitigate climate change impacts.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer zarei is a decorative tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage, making it a popular choice in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its ornamental value contributes to the aesthetic appeal of gardens and public spaces. In traditional medicine, its leaves and bark have been used to treat various ailments, though scientific validation of these uses is limited. Economically, it supports the ornamental plant industry, providing income for growers and landscapers.</p>
