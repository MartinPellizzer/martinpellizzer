<p>Avenula sulcata subsp.</p>
<p>gaditana, commonly known as the Iberian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, often reddish stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>
