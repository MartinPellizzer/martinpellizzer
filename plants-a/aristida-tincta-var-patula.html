<p>Aristida tincta var. patula, commonly known as purple threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and spikelets that are typically tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces small, bristly flowers that are wind-pollinated, and it thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in grasslands, deserts, and along roadsides, and it is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
