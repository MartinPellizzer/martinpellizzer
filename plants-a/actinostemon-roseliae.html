                <h1>Actinostemon roseliae</h1>
<p>Actinostemon roseliae, commonly known as the Roselie's star-stem, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features a short, sturdy stem with several whorls of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically blue or violet, with five petals that are slightly reflexed at the tips.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemon roseliae has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a slightly wavy margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon roseliae is primarily native to Brazil South.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of Brazil, particularly in the states of Paran√°, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul. This plant thrives in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in open woodlands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within this geographic region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon roseliae was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates where it can form dense, low-growing mats. Its introduction has been noted in several parts of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become a common ornamental plant in horticulture.</p>
