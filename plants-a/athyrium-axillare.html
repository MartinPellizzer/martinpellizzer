<p>Athyrium axillare, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, hairy structures along the veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices and forest understories. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Athyrium axillare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
