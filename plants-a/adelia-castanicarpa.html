                <h1>Adelia castanicarpa</h1>
<p>Adelia castanicarpa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia castanicarpa has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and displaying a deep green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and woody, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth when young and develops shallow fissures with age. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and relying on insect pollination, particularly by bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia castanicarpa is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. It is commonly associated with desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas where it can tolerate the harsh climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia castanicarpa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for erosion control.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread across various regions, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in a range of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, monitoring its spread is essential to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
