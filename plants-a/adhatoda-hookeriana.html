                <h1>Adhatoda hookeriana</h1>
<p>Adhatoda hookeriana, commonly known as the Indian Trumpet or Hooker's Trumpet, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>Adhatoda hookeriana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has also been used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda hookeriana has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, displaying a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a rough, bark-like texture, and grows in a climbing or shrub-like manner. Its flowers are tubular or bell-shaped, with a distinctive blue or violet color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda hookeriana is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, including countries such as India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions like Thailand and Malaysia. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly found in forests and along riverbanks where humidity is high.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely associated with areas that have a monsoonal climate pattern.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda hookeriana was mainly introduced to Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant has been introduced to these regions as part of horticultural trade and has become naturalized in some areas. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides, thriving in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
