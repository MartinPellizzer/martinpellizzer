                <h1>Achillea cuneata</h1>
<p>Achillea cuneata, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a distinctive grayish-green color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The flowers, which bloom in summer, are white to pale pink and are arranged in flat-topped clusters.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea cuneata has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged in a basal rosette and typically measuring about 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and arranged in flat, composite heads, blooming from late spring to early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, cylindrical achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea cuneata is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in countries such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of Italy.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions in the Mediterranean basin, where it has been introduced in some areas outside its native range. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Achillea cuneata is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea cuneata is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and yellow flowers, often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer, ensuring good germination rates. The plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea cuneata is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also offers shelter and habitat for various insects and small wildlife, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem. This plant acts as an effective erosion control species due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil. Additionally, it can function as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by improving soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological benefits make it an important component of sustainable landscaping and restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea cuneata is a flowering plant known for its potential medicinal uses, including anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that have been explored in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>It has also been studied for its possible applications in herbal remedies for skin conditions and digestive health. While not widely used in culinary contexts, it may have ornamental value in gardens due to its attractive yellow flowers. Its role in ecological settings, such as supporting pollinators, adds to its environmental significance.</p>
<p>However, its industrial and economic applications remain limited compared to other plants in the Asteraceae family.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea cuneata has several popular cultivars that are favored for their ornamental value, including 'Aurea' with its golden-yellow foliage and 'Paprika' known for its deep red flower heads.</p>
<p>While there are limited natural hybrids of Achillea cuneata, some horticulturalists have cross-bred it with other Achillea species to create new varieties with enhanced traits. These cultivars are often used in gardens for their drought tolerance and long-lasting blooms. Their horticultural importance lies in their ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and provide color throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea cuneata remains a valuable addition to native and low-maintenance landscapes.</p>
