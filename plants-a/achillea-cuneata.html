                <h1>Achillea cuneata</h1>
<p>Achillea cuneata, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its purported anti-inflammatory and astringent properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea cuneata has basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a woolly texture, arranged in a rosette formation and ranging from 2 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, growing from the base to a height of 30 to 60 cm. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disc flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea cuneata is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France.</p>
<p>It has been introduced to other regions, including parts of North America, where it is now found in gardens and disturbed soils. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes and grasslands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its non-native status in many areas and its ability to spread in cultivated settings, it is generally not considered a significant conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea cuneata is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and delicate white flowers, commonly cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of mature clumps, with division being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Achillea cuneata typically begins in early spring, with flowering occurring in late summer or early fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in poorly drained soil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like thyme or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea cuneata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense growth. This plant acts as an erosion control agent due to its deep root system, which stabilizes soil in disturbed areas. Additionally, it serves as a companion plant for other flora, enhancing biodiversity in native plant communities.</p>
<p>Its ecological benefits make it an important species in restoration and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea cuneata is a plant that has limited culinary use due to its bitter taste and lack of widespread culinary tradition.</p>
<p>It has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, though scientific validation is limited. In industrial and economic contexts, it is not widely utilized for commercial purposes. Culturally, it is not particularly symbolic in mainstream traditions, though it may hold local significance in certain regions.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications remain largely underexplored compared to more commonly known plants.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea cuneata has several popular cultivars such as 'Paprika', 'Orange Glow', and 'Temptation', which are prized for their vibrant flower colors and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>These cultivars are often used in garden settings for their ornamental value and hardiness. Hybrids of Achillea cuneata have been developed to enhance traits like disease resistance and extended blooming periods. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and its contribution to pollinator-friendly landscapes.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea cuneata remains a valuable addition to both wild and cultivated gardens.</p>
