                    <h1>Asparagus acutifolius var. eremicus</h1>
<p>Asparagus acutifolius var. eremicus, commonly known as the desert asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the Mediterranean and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features spiny, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, needle-like stems that are harvested in the summer. It is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in dry climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolutionary response to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
