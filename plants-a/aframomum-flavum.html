<p>Aframomum flavum, commonly known as the yellow cardamom, is a tropical plant native to Africa, particularly found in countries like Uganda and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by spadix-like inflorescences containing aromatic, yellowish fruits.</p>
<p>The fruits are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to cardamom, due to their distinct scent and flavor.</p>
