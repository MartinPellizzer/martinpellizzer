                <h1>Achyrophorus discolor</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus discolor, commonly known as the yellow sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus discolor has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, exhibiting a dark green color with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green to pale yellowish color, growing in a clump-like pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus discolor is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded woodlands and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in areas with rich, acidic soil and is often associated with mixed hardwood forests. Its distribution extends from New York to Georgia and westward into Tennessee and Kentucky.</p>
<p>It is a rare and endangered species, with limited populations in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus discolor was mainly introduced to the northeastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered an invasive species in several regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it difficult to control.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
