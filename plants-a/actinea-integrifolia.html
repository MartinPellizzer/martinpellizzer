                <h1>Actinea integrifolia</h1>
<p>Actinea integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf actinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems that are typically covered in soft, hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have smooth margins, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Actinea integrifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea integrifolia has palmate leaves that are typically 10â€“20 cm in diameter, with five to seven lobes that are smooth and lobed, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are a vibrant green, with a slightly glossy surface and a waxy cuticle. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unbranched and grows upright. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbel-like clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is primarily pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and feathery appendages.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea integrifolia is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded woodlands and along the edges of streams and rivers. This plant thrives in cool, humid climates and is often associated with deciduous forests. It is particularly abundant in the Appalachian region and parts of the Midwest.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches where it can receive adequate moisture and partial sunlight.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea integrifolia was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats, often near streams or in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with cool, temperate climates and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in parts of North America, particularly in the eastern United States. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activity, such as landscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is established.</p>
