                        <h1>Acarna gummifera</h1>
<p>Acarna gummifera, commonly known as the sticky acarna, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that exude a sticky substance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release its seeds.</p>
<p>Acarna gummifera is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acarna gummifera is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of moisture and suitable temperatures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acarna gummifera was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
