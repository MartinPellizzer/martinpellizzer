                    <h1>Arabidopsis mollissima</h1>
<p>Arabidopsis mollissima, commonly known as the woolly Arabidopsis, is a species of flowering plant in the mustard family, Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it a woolly appearance. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, rounded pods containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and genetic simplicity, it is sometimes used in ecological studies to understand plant adaptation to arid environments.</p>
