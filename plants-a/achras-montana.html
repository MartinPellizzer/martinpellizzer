                <h1>Achras montana</h1>
<p>Achras montana, commonly known as the mountain achiote, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small tree or shrub that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and palmate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange-red berries. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a woody stem, which contribute to its adaptability in various soil types.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras montana has leaves that are large, palmately lobed, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a spreading crown. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and have a yellowish-green color, blooming in the spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a woody, spherical capsule that splits open to release smooth, oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing water and nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras montana is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to specific areas in the Andes Mountains. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests, often growing near the forest floor. This species typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Achras montana is considered endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras montana is a striking plant known for its unique appearance and relatively easy care.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining the plant's characteristics. The growth cycle of Achras montana is slow, with the plant reaching maturity over several years, making it ideal for long-term landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can promote healthy growth, while pruning should be done sparingly to maintain its natural form. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or mealybugs, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like agave or yucca can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras montana is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in coastal ecosystems, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its dense growth also offers protection and nesting sites for birds and insects.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achras montana contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achras montana is a versatile plant with various uses and applications.</p>
<p>Its fruit, known as the "breadfruit," is commonly used in culinary practices across different cultures for its nutritious and starchy content. In medicinal applications, it has been traditionally used to treat ailments such as digestive issues and skin conditions. Industrially, the plant contributes to local economies through agriculture and trade, providing livelihoods for many communities.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some regions, representing sustenance and prosperity.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achras montana has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Carmen' and 'Aurea', which are known for their vibrant foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>While natural hybrids of Achras montana are relatively rare, some horticulturalists have successfully cross-bred it with related species to create new varieties with enhanced traits. These cultivars and hybrids are valued in landscaping for their ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Their adaptability and visual appeal make them important in both public and private gardens.</p>
<p>Overall, Achras montana contributes significantly to the diversity of ornamental plants in horticulture.</p>
