<p>Achras montana, commonly known as the mountain cholla, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, branching stems that store water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Achras montana is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
