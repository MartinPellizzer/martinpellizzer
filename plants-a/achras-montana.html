                <h1>Achras montana</h1>
<p>Achras montana, commonly known as the mountain cholla, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, branching stems that store water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Achras montana is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras montana has large, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, and can reach up to 60 cm in diameter, with a bright green color.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a solitary, upright shrub. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, with a simple structure, blooming in the spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras montana is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the region of the eastern rainforests. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to Madagascar, where it is an important component of the local flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras montana was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its striking appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil. The plant is often cultivated for its large, palm-like leaves and its ability to tolerate a variety of environmental conditions. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in certain regions where it establishes itself aggressively.</p>
