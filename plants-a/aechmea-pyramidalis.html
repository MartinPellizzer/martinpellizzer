<p>Aechmea pyramidalis, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant's inflorescence consists of a tall, spiky flower stem topped with colorful bracts that resemble a pineapple. Its foliage is often adorned with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Aechmea pyramidalis is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
