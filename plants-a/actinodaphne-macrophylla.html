                <h1>Actinodaphne macrophylla</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, glossy, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its aromatic leaves and bark contain essential oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor.</p>
<p>The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne macrophylla has large, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that has a slightly fibrous texture. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne macrophylla is primarily native to Jawa, Malaya, and Queensland.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical regions of these areas. It typically grows in lowland rainforests and moist environments. The plant is part of the Lauraceae family, known for its aromatic properties.</p>
<p>Its natural range includes parts of Southeast Asia and northern Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne macrophylla was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in shaded to semi-shaded environments. The plant has been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas. Its distribution is often associated with human activity, including horticultural trade and ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential invasiveness in non-native habitats.</p>
