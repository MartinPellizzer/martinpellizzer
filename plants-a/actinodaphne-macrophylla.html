                <h1>Actinodaphne macrophylla</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter beneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits. Its wood is valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine and incense.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne macrophylla has large, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and somewhat woody, with a grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers. It produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with a sweet scent, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed berry that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through birds and water.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne macrophylla is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution extends to parts of Indonesia and the Philippines, where it thrives in humid lowland forests. This species prefers warm, moist environments with high rainfall, typically found in shaded understory layers of tropical rainforests. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status is currently listed as vulnerable, highlighting the need for further protection efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne macrophylla is a tropical evergreen shrub known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for rapid growth. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically thriving in warm, humid climates with indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended. Common pests include scale insects and mealybugs, while root rot can occur if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or other shade-loving plants can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne macrophylla is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its fragrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of the local ecosystem. It also acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through mutualistic relationships. Additionally, its extensive root system helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil and preventing land degradation.</p>
<p>Overall, Actinodaphne macrophylla plays a crucial ecological role by supporting biodiversity and maintaining environmental balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
