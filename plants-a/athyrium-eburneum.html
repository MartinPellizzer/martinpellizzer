<p>Athyrium eburneum, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor.</p>
<p>Athyrium eburneum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded gardens.</p>
