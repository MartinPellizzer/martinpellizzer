                <h1>Adiantum obliquum</h1>
<p>Adiantum obliquum, commonly known as the zigzag water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that have a distinctive zigzag pattern along their edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, narrow pinnae that are slightly curved.</p>
<p>Adiantum obliquum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, indoor setting.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum obliquum has fern-like leaves that are triangular in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure between 10 to 20 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a delicate, feathery texture. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is covered in a smooth, pale green bark, growing in a clumping pattern.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, appearing in late spring to early summer. The fruit is a globose capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum obliquum is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil South, Brazil Southeast, Brazil West-Central, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Jamaica, Leeward Is., Mexico Gulf, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, Nicaragua, Panam√°, Peru, Puerto Rico, Suriname, Trinidad-Tobago, Venezuela, and Windward Is.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It is particularly prevalent in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. The plant's wide distribution suggests it has adapted to a variety of microhabitats across these regions.</p>
<p>Adiantum obliquum is a common species in the understory of forests and along stream banks in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum obliquum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories.</p>
<p>It is typically found in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. This plant prefers cool to temperate climates and is commonly associated with rocky or calcareous substrates. Its introduction is often linked to human activity, such as horticultural trade or accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has become naturalized in some regions outside its native range, posing potential ecological impacts.</p>
