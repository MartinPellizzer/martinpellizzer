                <h1>Aconitella teheranica</h1>
<p>Aconitella teheranica, commonly known as the Persian buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers are usually solitary, with a distinctive cup-like structure.</p>
<p>Aconitella teheranica is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitella teheranica has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm in length, displaying a dark green color with a slightly pubescent surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are blue to violet in color, arranged in racemose inflorescences, with five petals and a tubular corolla, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitella teheranica is primarily native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, specifically in parts of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>It grows in high-altitude habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant is adapted to cold and temperate climates, often found in areas with well-drained soil. It is commonly associated with the greater Caucasus mountain range, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitella teheranica was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has been found in regions with temperate climates, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. The plant's introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value, which contributes to its spread.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study in many regions.</p>
