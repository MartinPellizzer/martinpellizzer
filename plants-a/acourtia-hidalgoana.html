                <h1>Acourtia hidalgoana</h1>
<p>Acourtia hidalgoana, commonly known as Hidalgo's acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, while its flowers are small and yellow, often appearing in clusters.</p>
<p>Acourtia hidalgoana is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia hidalgoana has small, narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, semi-woody, and has a grayish-brown bark with a rough, fissured texture. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia hidalgoana is primarily native to the Mexico Gulf and Mexico Northeast regions.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the Gulf Coast. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Acourtia hidalgoana is often associated with maritime environments and can be found in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats in these geographic areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia hidalgoana was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides, open fields, and degraded grasslands. It has been observed spreading along the edges of agricultural areas and in urban landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in several states, including Texas and New Mexico.</p>
