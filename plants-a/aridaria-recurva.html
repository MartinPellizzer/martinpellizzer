                    <h1>Aridaria recurva</h1>
<p>Aridaria recurva, commonly known as the curled arid grass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that curl inward, reducing water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and drought-resistant foliage.</p>
<p>Aridaria recurva plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing minimal forage for desert wildlife.</p>
