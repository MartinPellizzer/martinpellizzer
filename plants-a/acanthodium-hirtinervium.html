<p>Acanthodium hirtinervium, commonly known as the hairy-veined acanthodium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are narrow and hairy, giving the plant its common name, while the veins are prominently raised and covered with fine hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
