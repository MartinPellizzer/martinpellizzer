<p>Aneilema neocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonia aneilema, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the island of New Caledonia in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by ornamental red berries that persist into the winter. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
