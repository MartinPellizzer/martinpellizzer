<p>Astragalus exasperatus, commonly known as the rough milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, serrated leaflets and produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Astragalus exasperatus is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range.</p>
