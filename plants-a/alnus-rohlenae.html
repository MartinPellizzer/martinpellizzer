<p>Alnus rohlenae, commonly known as the Robles alder, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in southern Peru.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Alnus rohlenae is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activities.</p>
