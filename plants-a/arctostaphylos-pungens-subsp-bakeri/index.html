                            <h1>Arctostaphylos Pungens Subsp. Bakeri</h1>
<p>Arctostaphylos pungens subsp. bakeri is a rare and hardy shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is known for its dense, evergreen foliage and its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. This subspecies is particularly adapted to high elevations where temperatures can be extreme and soil conditions are poor. Its small, leathery leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers make it a distinctive plant in its ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is often considered a valuable species for conservation efforts.</p>
