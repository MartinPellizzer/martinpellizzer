                    <h1>Amphithalea micrantha var. nitida</h1>
<p>Amphithalea micrantha var. nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf sandmat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, pubescent hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well-suited to harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
