<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer fauriei has palmately compound leaves that are typically 5–9 cm long, with ovate to elliptic leaflets arranged radiating from a central point, and a dark green upper surface with a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender and erect, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed capsule, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its natural habitat in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer fauriei is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in its native range and has been introduced to other parts of the world, including Japan and the United States, where it is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections. This plant thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soils in shaded to semi-shaded environments. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where it can withstand cooler temperatures and higher humidity.</p>
<p>Acer fauriei is considered a rare species, facing threats from habitat loss and over-collection, leading to its classification as endangered in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer fauriei is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seedlings requiring patience due to slow germination. The growth cycle of Acer fauriei includes a period of rapid growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and moderate watering, preferring full sun to partial shade. Regular fertilization in spring and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or scale insects.</p>
