                <h1>Acer × neglectum var. elongatum</h1>
<p>Acer × neglectum var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated maple, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Acer negundo and Acer pseudoplatanus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping growth habit and distinctive elongated leaves that are typically lobed and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × neglectum var. elongatum has elongated, ovate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, reaching up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are smooth and light gray, with a growth pattern that is upright and somewhat weeping, especially in mature plants. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, with two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting well to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × neglectum var. elongatum is a hybrid maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in areas of Sichuan and Hubei provinces.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America and Europe, where it is cultivated for ornamental purposes. This variety thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils along forest edges or in shaded understories. It typically occurs at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters, where it benefits from cool, humid conditions.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its limited natural habitat and hybrid origin raise concerns about its long-term conservation in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × neglectum var. elongatum is a unique ornamental tree known for its delicate, weeping form and vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings taken in early summer, which root easily under humid conditions. The growth cycle of this tree is relatively slow, with moderate growth rates that make it suitable for smaller gardens.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer × neglectum var. elongatum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers aesthetic value and can help support local ecosystems by creating microhabitats for insects and other small animals.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer × neglectum var. elongatum is a decorative tree commonly used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and unique branching structure.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its aesthetic value makes it popular in landscaping and urban gardening. In traditional medicine, it has been occasionally utilized for its potential anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific evidence is limited. The tree also holds cultural significance in some regions, where it is appreciated for its visual appeal in public spaces.</p>
<p>Economically, it contributes to the horticultural industry by providing ornamental value and supporting related businesses.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer × neglectum var. elongatum has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Aureum' with its golden foliage and 'Variegatum' featuring striking variegated leaves.</p>
<p>It is often hybridized with other maple species to create unique forms with enhanced growth habits or foliage characteristics. These hybrids are valued in horticulture for their adaptability to different climates and their ability to thrive in urban environments. The plant's versatility makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both aesthetic appeal and low maintenance.</p>
<p>Its cultivars and hybrids contribute significantly to the diversity of ornamental maples in landscape design.</p>
