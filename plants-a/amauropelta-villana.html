<p>Amauropelta villana, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, scale-like structures on the underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
