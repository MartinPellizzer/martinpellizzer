<p>Allocasuarina mackliniana subsp.</p>
<p>xerophila, commonly known as the Macklin's she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are adapted for water conservation.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its woody structure and reduced leaves are typical adaptations to its harsh, dry environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in sandy soils and is resilient to drought and high temperatures.</p>
