                    <h1>Allium tricoccum var. burdickii</h1>
<p>Allium tricoccum var. burdickii, commonly known as Burdick's ramps, is a variant of the wild leek native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, grass-like leaves and pale green, bulbous stems that emerge in early spring. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers arranged in a loose cluster, typical of the Allium genus. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, loamy soils.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique genetic variation and is closely related to other Allium species such as A. tricoccum and A. canadense.</p>
