<p>Aponogeton heudelotii, commonly known as the African water lettuce, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it stay afloat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by dark, spherical fruits. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in shallow waters, while its leaves provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Aponogeton heudelotii is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits.</p>
