                    <h1>Aspidium fraxinifolium</h1>
<p>Aspidium fraxinifolium, commonly known as the European water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet woodlands. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, allowing it to absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
