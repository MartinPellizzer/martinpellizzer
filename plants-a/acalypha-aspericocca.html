                <h1>Acalypha aspericocca</h1>
<p>Acalypha aspericocca, commonly known as the rough-leaved spurge, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Acalypha aspericocca is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha aspericocca has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes woody as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha aspericocca is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of the world, including tropical and subtropical regions, often as an introduced species. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in rainforests, shrublands, and along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and widespread distribution, it is generally not considered threatened, though its conservation status may vary by region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha aspericocca is a fast-growing, ornamental shrub known for its vibrant foliage and unique leaf patterns.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick results. This plant thrives in warm, sunny climates and follows a growth cycle that includes rapid growth during the growing season, followed by a period of dormancy in cooler months.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it requires well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilize it with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and prune to maintain shape and encourage bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
