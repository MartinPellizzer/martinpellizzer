                        <h1>Acalypha alopecuroidea lusus glanduligera</h1>
<p>Acalypha alopecuroidea lusus glanduligera, commonly known as the woolly acalypha, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage that gives it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, which contribute to its unique texture and appearance.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking visual appeal.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha alopecuroidea lusus glanduligera is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats like forest edges and agricultural lands. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to its ability to adapt to a variety of environmental conditions in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha alopecuroidea lusus glanduligera was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the early 20th century by horticultural enthusiasts and gardeners. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become a potential invasive species in certain regions of New Zealand. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds and can outcompete native vegetation in disturbed or poorly managed areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the importance of monitoring non-native plants for ecological impacts.</p>
