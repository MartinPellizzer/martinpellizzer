                    <h1>Allium scorodoprasum var. viviparum</h1>
<p>Allium scorodoprasum var. viviparum, commonly known as the wild garlic or ramsons, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, glaucous leaves and produces umbels of pale purple to white flowers. The plant is characterized by its strong garlic scent, which is due to the presence of sulfur compounds in its tissues. It reproduces both sexually through seeds and vegetatively via bulbils, which form along the flower stalks.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist woodland habitats and is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses.</p>
