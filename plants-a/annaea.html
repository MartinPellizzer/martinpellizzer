                    <h1>Annaea</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Annea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has thin, thread-like roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered critically endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
