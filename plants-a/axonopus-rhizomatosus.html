                    <h1>Axonopus rhizomatosus</h1>
<p>Axonopus rhizomatosus, commonly known as creeping spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a rhizomatous growth habit, forming dense mats of foliage that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
