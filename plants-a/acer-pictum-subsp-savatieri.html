                <h1>Acer pictum subsp. savatieri</h1>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>savatieri, commonly known as the Red Maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive red to orange-red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a serrated margin, often with a red or purple tinge during the growing season. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit.</p>
<p>The tree thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adaptable to a variety of light conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>savatieri has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“8 cm in length, with a bright red or orange coloration during the fall. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a vertical growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in catkins, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed, which is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>savatieri is a rare maple species native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Himalayas, primarily in Nepal and northern India. While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is restricted to a few isolated populations in these areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments such as montane forests and rocky slopes. This subspecies is typically found at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>savatieri is a striking maple known for its vibrant red and orange foliage, often cultivated for ornamental purposes. It can be propagated through seed or softwood cuttings, with cuttings being the more reliable method for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. This species has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years, making it suitable for long-term landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be moderate, with a balanced fertilizer applied in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and encourage healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or evergreens can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>savatieri is a valuable native plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in riparian and woodland areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil quality and offering habitat for small mammals and birds.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>savatieri is a lesser-known maple species native to specific regions of Eastern Europe, primarily valued for its ornamental appeal due to its striking foliage. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its wood has been historically utilized in small-scale woodworking for decorative purposes.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it has been explored for potential anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Culturally, it holds significance in local botany and horticulture, symbolizing resilience and natural beauty in certain communities.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems supports biodiversity, making it an important plant for conservation efforts in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pictum subsp.</p>
<p>savatieri has several popular cultivars such as 'Aureum', known for its bright yellow foliage, and 'Variegatum', which features striking variegated leaves. It also has hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the diversity of ornamental maples in horticulture.</p>
<p>These cultivars and hybrids are valued for their unique leaf patterns and color changes throughout the growing season. They are widely used in gardens and landscapes for their aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Their horticultural importance lies in their ability to add visual interest and color to temperate climates.</p>
