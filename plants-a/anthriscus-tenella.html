<p>Anthriscus tenella, commonly known as cow parsley, is a biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“90 cm and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are often used in salads or as a garnish, and the plant is also a host for certain butterfly species.</p>
<p>Anthriscus tenella is often mistaken for poison hemlock due to its similar appearance, but it is not toxic to humans or livestock.</p>
