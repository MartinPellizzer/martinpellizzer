                <h1>Aechmea poitaei</h1>
<p>Aechmea poitaei, commonly known as the Potho plant, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are thick, waxy, and often display vibrant green or variegated patterns. It produces striking inflorescences with colorful bracts that range from red to orange.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in humid, bright but indirect light conditions and is popular as a decorative houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea poitaei has rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow, sword-like, and arranged in a dense spiral, with a bright green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, fibrous base that supports the rosette structure. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by colorful bracts, typically in shades of red or orange, and bloom during the dry season, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains small seeds, which are dispersed by animals attracted to the fruit's scent and color.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the surrounding substrate.</p>
