                    <h1>Alchemilla vulgaris var. gracillima</h1>
<p>Alchemilla vulgaris var. gracillima, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of soft, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, ground-covering mats.</p>
