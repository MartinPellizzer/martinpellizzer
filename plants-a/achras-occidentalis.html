                <h1>Achras occidentalis</h1>
<p>Achras occidentalis, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Arecaceae and is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and a smooth, pale green trunk. The tree produces a fleshy, spiny fruit that contains a starchy, edible pulp and a central core of seeds. The plant is well adapted to warm, humid climates and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in both ecological systems and human agriculture, particularly in Pacific island cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras occidentalis has large, palm-like leaves that are typically broad, fan-shaped, and have a waxy green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant, and they can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, and they are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a spiny, globose structure that contains seeds dispersed by animals attracted to the fruit's scent and appearance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras occidentalis is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of South America, particularly in Brazil and the northern regions of Argentina. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and dry forests. It is commonly associated with sandy soils and is sometimes referred to as the "giant rat-tail cactus.".</p>
<p>Its natural range extends to the Florida Keys in the United States as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras occidentalis was mainly introduced to the Caribbean, Central America, and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites due to its tolerance for salty and sandy soils. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly its large, spiny fruit. It has been reported in Florida and the Gulf Coast of the United States as well.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
