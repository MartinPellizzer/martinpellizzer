                <h1>Achras occidentalis</h1>
<p>Achras occidentalis, commonly known as the "cotton tree," is a large, evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fibrous bark and large, palm-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, red berries containing seeds. Its trunk is known for producing a cotton-like fiber, which has been used traditionally for making ropes and textiles.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits in tropical regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras occidentalis has large, palm-like leaves that are typically fan-shaped, arranged in a rosette pattern, and can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is thick, woody, and covered in a smooth, greyish-brown bark, growing as a solitary trunk with no branches. It produces large, white or cream-colored flowers that are clustered in a spadix surrounded by a leaf-like bract, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals attracted to the fruit's scent and appearance.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and access water in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras occidentalis is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, specifically the Greater Antilles, including Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of southern Florida and has been introduced to other tropical regions around the world. This species thrives in moist, sunny environments such as coastal dunes and sandy soils near the ocean. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat faces threats from habitat loss and coastal development.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras occidentalis is a fast-growing, tropical plant known for its large, edible fruits and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seed propagation being the most common method. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, reaching maturity within a few years, and thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from fungal issues in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like basil or marigold can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras occidentalis is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing soil fertility and promoting biodiversity. Its deep root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological balance by supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achras occidentalis is a versatile plant with various uses across different fields.</p>
<p>Its fruit, known as the "breadfruit," is widely used in culinary applications, providing a nutritious and starchy food source in tropical regions. In traditional medicine, it has been utilized for its potential health benefits, including treating digestive issues and inflammation. Industrially, the plant contributes to local economies through agriculture and trade, supporting rural communities.</p>
