                        <h1>Acanthura mattogrossensis</h1>
<p>Acanthura mattogrossensis, commonly known as the Brazilian thornbush, is a shrub native to the Cerrado biome of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Acanthura mattogrossensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthura mattogrossensis is primarily native to the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso.</p>
<p>It is found in the central and southern regions of the state, particularly in the Cerrado biome. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and is commonly found in grassland and savanna ecosystems. It is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the seasonal climate of the region.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a regional endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthura mattogrossensis was mainly introduced to new habitats in South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It has been found in areas of Brazil, Paraguay, and Bolivia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant is often associated with disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in human-altered landscapes. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is now considered an invasive species in several regions where it has been introduced.</p>
