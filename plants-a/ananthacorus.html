                    <h1>Ananthacorus</h1>
<p>Ananthacorus, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant typically has a slender, creeping rhizome that supports its growth in shallow water environments. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe.</p>
<p>Ananthacorus is often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams, contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
