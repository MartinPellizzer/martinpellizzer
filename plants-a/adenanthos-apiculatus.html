                <h1>Adenanthos apiculatus</h1>
<p>Adenanthos apiculatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adenanthos, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered white or yellowish flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, round fruits that are typically edible.</p>
<p>It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos apiculatus has leaves that are narrow, linear, and slightly pointed, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unbranched and grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pale yellow petals and a distinctive tubular shape, blooming from late autumn to early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry, and the seeds are small and winged for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils in which the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos apiculatus is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the areas around the Fitzgerald River National Park and the Margaret River region. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and near-coastal habitats. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Adenanthos apiculatus is an important component of the local flora and is often found in open woodland and heathland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos apiculatus was mainly introduced to South Australia and southern New South Wales, where it has established populations in disturbed and open habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along coastal areas and in heathlands. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its vibrant yellow flowers and compact growth habit. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its spread beyond cultivated areas.</p>
