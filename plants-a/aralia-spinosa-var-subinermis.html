<p>Aralia spinosa var. subinermis, commonly known as the smooth aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves that are typically pinnately arranged, with serrated margins and a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and unique, spiny fruit structures.</p>
