                <h1>Acianthera pectinata</h1>
<p>Acianthera pectinata, commonly known as the feathered orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Acianthera pectinata is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera pectinata has leaves that are elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and a yellowish throat, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera pectinata is primarily native to Brazil South and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans these regions. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with rocky outcrops and secondary forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific areas within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera pectinata was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in forested regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments where there is ample sunlight and consistent moisture. This plant is commonly found in regions of South America, particularly in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>However, its introduction to new regions can sometimes lead to ecological impacts if it becomes invasive.</p>
