                    <h1>Agrostis tuvinica</h1>
<p>Agrostis tuvinica, commonly known as Tuvinian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences containing minute flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in harsh environments.</p>
