<p>Akebia trifoliata var. honanensis, commonly known as the Chinese honeylocust, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are composed of three heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that mature in late summer. Its stems are covered in distinctive, warty tubercles, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other Akebia species and is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
