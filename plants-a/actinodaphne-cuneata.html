                <h1>Actinodaphne cuneata</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces drupes that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its wood and essential oils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne cuneata has elliptical to ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and grayish-brown, with a straight growth pattern, and the bark is thin and slightly fissured. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers with a fragrant scent, blooming during the wet season, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through birds and water.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne cuneata is primarily native to the Indo-Pacific region, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forests, often in humid and tropical climates. This species thrives in shaded understory environments and is typically associated with secondary growth areas. It is also present in some regions of New Guinea and the western Pacific islands.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific ecological conditions, its distribution is relatively restricted to these tropical and subtropical areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne cuneata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in certain areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse soil conditions contribute to its spread.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still under study in many regions.</p>
