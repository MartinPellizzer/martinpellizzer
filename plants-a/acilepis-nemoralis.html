                <h1>Acilepis nemoralis</h1>
<p>Acilepis nemoralis, commonly known as the European rock rose, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rosaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in rocky or limestone soils. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acilepis nemoralis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis nemoralis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring between 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis nemoralis is primarily native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the dry zone of the island, particularly in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant is well adapted to the tropical climate and seasonal rainfall patterns of Sri Lanka. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the country.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis nemoralis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate temperatures and well-drained soils. The plant has been observed spreading through seed dispersal by wind and animals. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
