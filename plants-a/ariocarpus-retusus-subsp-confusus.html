<p>Ariocarpus retusus subsp.</p>
<p>confusus, commonly known as the "Lace Flower" or "Cactus of the Desert," is a rare and unique cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring, which are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its leaves are reduced to small, spine-like structures, and it has a distinctive root system that helps it survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is highly valued by cactus enthusiasts due to its ornamental appearance and ecological significance.</p>
