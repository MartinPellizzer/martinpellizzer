                <h1>Aconitum maowenense</h1>
<p>Aconitum maowenense, commonly known as Maowen aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to China.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its tall, sparsely leafy stems and striking blue to purple flowers. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically palmately divided. Aconitum maowenense contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>
<p>It is often found in moist, shaded environments in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum maowenense has large, compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, typically measuring up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and erect, covered with a rough, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and grows straight upward without branching. Its flowers are showy, blue-violet in color, arranged in racemes, and consist of five petals with a spurred lower petal; they bloom in late summer and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, serving as storage organs for nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum maowenense is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate and subalpine forests at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or forested slopes. It is endemic to the Maowen area, which is part of the Hengduan Mountains range.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
