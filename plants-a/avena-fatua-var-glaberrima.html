<p>Avena fatua var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth wild oat, is a variant of the wild oat species native to temperate regions.</p>

The inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers. Its seeds are typically matured in late summer and dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>This plant is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
