<p>Acacia erioclada, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stem and small, bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to leaflets. The plant produces yellow or pale yellow flowers arranged in compact, globular heads, which are a notable feature. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal areas.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil rehabilitation.</p>
