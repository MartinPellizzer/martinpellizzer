                    <h1>Ampelopsis tomentosa var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Ampelopsis tomentosa var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leafed bittersweet, is a climbing vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five ovate leaflets, often covered in a fine, woolly pubescence that becomes smoother as the plant matures. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into bright orange-red berries in the fall. These berries are a food source for birds and can persist on the plant through winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in partial to full sun and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks.</p>
