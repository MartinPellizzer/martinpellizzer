<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with a wide range of floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malvales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have showy flowers and include economically significant genera like cotton and hibiscus. Its family is Malvaceae, commonly known as the mallow family, characterized by their sympetalous flowers and often hairy leaves.
