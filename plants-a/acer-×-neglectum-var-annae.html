                <h1>Acer × neglectum var. annae</h1>
<p>Acer × neglectum var. annae, commonly known as the Ann Arbor maple, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange foliage in the autumn, making it a popular ornamental species. The tree typically grows to a height of 15–25 feet and has a rounded, upright form. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with finely serrated margins and a glossy green upper surface.</p>
<p>It prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, thriving in temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × neglectum var. annae has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface that turns red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin strips as the tree matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting well to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × neglectum var. annae is a hybrid maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan and Hubei.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and largely restricted to botanical gardens and private collections due to its rarity in the wild. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, typically found in temperate forests and rocky slopes. This species is generally found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited natural occurrence, Acer × neglectum var. annae is considered a conservation concern and is listed as endangered in some regional assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × neglectum var. annae is a slow-growing, ornamental maple known for its unique foliage and compact form.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree are recommended for optimal health and appearance.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care and companion planting such as lavender or marigold to deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer × neglectum var. annae is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed-species forests, enhancing overall plant health and resilience. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for a variety of organisms.</p>
