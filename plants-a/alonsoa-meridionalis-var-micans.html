                    <h1>Alonsoa meridionalis var. micans</h1>
<p>Alonsoa meridionalis var. micans, commonly known as the silverleaf alonsoa, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, soft pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to violet in color, blooming during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in arid regions for landscaping purposes.</p>
