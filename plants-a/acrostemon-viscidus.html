                <h1>Acrostemon viscidus</h1>
<p>Acrostemon viscidus, commonly known as the sticky acrostemon, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a red or purple throat. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in a sticky substance, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Acrostemon viscidus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostemon viscidus has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a sticky, viscid texture, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing upright with branching patterns. The flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, featuring showy violet petals with a yellow center, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, aiding in water absorption and stabilizing the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostemon viscidus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant is commonly associated with humid climates and is often seen in swampy or seasonally flooded areas. It is also present in parts of India and Sri Lanka, where it grows in similar moist environments.</p>
<p>Acrostemon viscidus is known for its striking yellow flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostemon viscidus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant spreads primarily through its rhizomes, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly. Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to control its spread and preserve local ecosystems.</p>
