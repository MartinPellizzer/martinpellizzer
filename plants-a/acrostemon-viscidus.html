<p>Acrostemon viscidus, commonly known as the sticky acrostemon, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy, sticky leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are often brightly colored, ranging from red to purple, and are attractive to pollinators like bees and birds.</p>
<p>Acrostemon viscidus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostemon viscidus has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and have a dark green color with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, green bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals with yellow stamens, and bloom during the summer months; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostemon viscidus is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
