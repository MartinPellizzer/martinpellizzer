                <h1>Adenodolichos obtusifolius</h1>
<p>Adenodolichos obtusifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved horsegram, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with rounded lobes and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often grown for its edible seeds, which are used in traditional cuisines.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos obtusifolius has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rounded or blunt tip, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, slightly pubescent bark that is light to mid-brown in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five pink to purple petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos obtusifolius is primarily native to southern and eastern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, savannas, and along roadsides in these regions. This plant thrives in temperate to warm climates and is often associated with disturbed soils. It is a legume, which means it can fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the African continent, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos obtusifolius was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a forage crop due to its high nutritional value for livestock. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native plants in certain regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in agricultural and pastoral areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
