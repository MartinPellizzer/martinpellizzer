                    <h1>Alexitoxicon cretaceum</h1>
<p>Alexitoxicon cretaceum, commonly known as the Cretaceous poison plant, is a rare and ancient species with unique botanical features.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from underground sources.</p>
<p>Due to its historical presence in the Cretaceous period, it is of significant interest to paleobotanists and conservationists.</p>
