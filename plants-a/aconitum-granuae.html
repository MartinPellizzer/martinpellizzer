                <h1>Aconitum granuae</h1>
<p>Aconitum granuae, commonly known as the Granua larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes along the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed divisions, and are often covered in a fine layer of hairs.</p>
<p>Aconitum granuae is adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum granuae has large, deeply lobed leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with a spurred petal and arranged in a raceme, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum granuae is primarily native to Hungary.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Carpathian Basin. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and along stream banks. It is commonly found in areas with rich, loamy soil.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Hungary.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum granuae was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and naturalized areas in the northeastern and northwestern regions of the country. Despite its beauty, it is considered invasive in some areas because of its ability to spread rapidly and outcompete native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
