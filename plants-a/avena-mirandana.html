                    <h1>Avena mirandana</h1>
<p>Avena mirandana, commonly known as the miracle oat, is a rare and endangered species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence that bears small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with poor soil. Its seeds are encased in a tough, fibrous hull, which makes them difficult to process and cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Avena mirandana is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
