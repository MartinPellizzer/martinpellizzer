                <h1>Achillea muenteriana</h1>
<p>Achillea muenteriana, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its slender stems and finely divided leaves are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions.</p>
<p>The pale yellow to white flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea muenteriana has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and range from 10 to 30 cm in length, with a grayish-green color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea muenteriana is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and open grasslands. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is also known to occur in parts of Oregon and Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to Mediterranean climate zones with dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea muenteriana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, sunny areas such as stream banks and meadows. This plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>Its spread is a concern for local ecosystems and land managers.</p>
