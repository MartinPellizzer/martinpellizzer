                    <h1>Aegilops ovata var. brachyathera</h1>
<p>Aegilops ovata var. brachyathera, commonly known as the short awn wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive awns that are shorter than those of the typical Aegilops ovata. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with leathery, dark brown glumes. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for forage and genetic diversity.</p>
