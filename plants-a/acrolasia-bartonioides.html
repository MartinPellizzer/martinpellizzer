                <h1>Acrolasia bartonioides</h1>
<p>Acrolasia bartonioides, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers have a strong, sweet fragrance that becomes more intense as night progresses.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique blooming habit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolasia bartonioides has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, bark that is reddish-brown in color and exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in the plant's ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia bartonioides is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. This plant thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and ample sunlight. It is often associated with forest understories and is part of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia bartonioides was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia, as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to warm climates.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond its initial introduction sites, establishing itself in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in low-nutrient environments have contributed to its widespread distribution. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists regarding its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
