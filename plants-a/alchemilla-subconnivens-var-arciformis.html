                    <h1>Alchemilla subconnivens var. arciformis</h1>
<p>Alchemilla subconnivens var. arciformis, commonly known as the silverweed or false spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in loose clusters atop slender stems. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
