                <h1>Acer rubrum f. rotundata</h1>
<p>Acer rubrum f. rotundata, commonly known as the red maple with round leaves, is a variant of the red maple tree characterized by its distinctive, more rounded leaf shape compared to the typical lobed leaves of the species.</p>
<p>This form exhibits the same vibrant autumn coloration as the standard red maple, with leaves turning shades of red, orange, and yellow. It is a deciduous tree that thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in eastern North America. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in landscaping for its seasonal display.</p>
<p>Its foliage and overall structure make it a popular choice for parks and gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum f. rotundata has rounded, palmately lobed leaves that are larger than typical red maples, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are smooth and reddish-brown, with a growth pattern that is upright and branching, forming a dense canopy. The flowers are small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring, with wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, providing strong anchorage and efficient water absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum f. rotundata is a rare variant of the red maple, native to the southeastern United States, primarily in Georgia and South Carolina.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Carolinas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mesic to wetland environments, often found in bottomlands and along stream banks. This species typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level to around 300 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum f. rotundata is a unique cultivar of red maple known for its rounded leaves and vibrant autumn color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings offering the most reliable results. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 10-20 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like aphids or verticillium wilt.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs like hydrangeas or perennials such as hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum f. rotundata is a unique variant of the red maple that plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its seeds are a food source for birds and small mammals. It acts as a companion plant in mixed hardwood forests, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a healthy ecosystem. The dense canopy it forms helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by shedding leaves that decompose and enrich the soil.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum f. rotundata is a unique cultivar of red maple known for its distinctive round, lobed leaves and vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>While it is primarily valued for its ornamental use in landscaping and gardens, it has limited direct culinary applications due to its bitter taste and toxic sap. Historically, some indigenous groups may have used parts of the plant for medicinal purposes, though specific applications are not well documented. In industrial contexts, it contributes to the timber and paper industries when used as a source of wood.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes beauty and seasonal change, making it a popular subject in art and literature.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum f. rotundata has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their unique leaf shapes and coloration, such as 'Crimson Queen' and 'Coral Maple,' which are known for their striking red foliage.</p>
<p>It also has several hybrids that combine the ornamental traits of Acer rubrum with those of other maple species, enhancing its adaptability and visual appeal. These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and disease resistance, making them more suitable for a wider range of climates. Horticulturally, Acer rubrum f. rotundata is important for its role in ornamental landscaping, providing year-round visual interest with its foliage and delicate flowers.</p>
<p>Its cultivars and hybrids are widely used in gardens and public spaces due to their aesthetic value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
