                    <h1>Acacia sciophanes</h1>
<p>Acacia sciophanes, commonly known as the shade acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has adapted to low-water environments through its deep root system and waxy leaf surfaces that reduce water loss. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the seed pods produce hard, angular seeds.</p>
<p>Acacia sciophanes is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of firewood in its native habitats.</p>
