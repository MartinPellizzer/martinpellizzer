                <h1>Acer decandrum</h1>
<p>Acer decandrum, commonly known as the sugar maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to nine lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests.</p>
<p>The sugar maple is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in the production of maple syrup.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer decandrum has palmately compound leaves that are typically 5-7 cm in length, with a bright green color during the growing season and a striking red or orange hue in autumn.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes furrowed with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated and have a simple structure with separate sepals and petals. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed pod that disperses by wind, allowing the seeds to travel several meters from the parent plant.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer decandrum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, primarily found in China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including North America and Europe, as an ornamental plant. It thrives in temperate climates, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils within forests or along stream banks. This species is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat faces threats from deforestation and climate change, leading to a decline in its wild populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer decandrum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant fall foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and regular watering, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while diseases like leaf spot can occur; companion planting with native grasses and wildflowers supports biodiversity and health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer decandrum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecosystem biodiversity. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil structure and promoting the growth of other plant species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer decandrum plays a role in improving air quality by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer decandrum is a species of maple known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its sap can be tapped and processed similarly to other maple species. In traditional medicine, various parts of the plant have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions. Industrially, it contributes to local economies through forestry and landscaping practices.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in regional art and botanical studies.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer decandrum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Crimson Sentinel,' known for their striking red foliage. It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer ginnala, to produce cultivars like 'Autumn Blaze' and 'October Glory.'. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced fall color and improved hardiness.</p>
<p>Horticulturally, Acer decandrum and its cultivars are important for landscape design, providing seasonal interest and structural beauty in gardens and parks.</p>
