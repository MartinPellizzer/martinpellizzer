                <h1>Acer decandrum</h1>
<p>Acer decandrum, commonly known as the sugar maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to nine lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, developing shallow furrows with age.</p>
<p>Acer decandrum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in parks and urban landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer decandrum has palmately compound leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a broad ovate shape, dark green on top and pale underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, with a simple structure and wind as the primary pollination method.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that disperse by wind, and the roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer decandrum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented, with populations primarily restricted to specific regions in China. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes, typically at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Acer decandrum is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer decandrum is a deciduous tree known for its striking red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves rapid growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Regular fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and health are essential. It is relatively pest and disease resistant but may occasionally face issues like aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer decandrum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy white flowers in spring. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by improving soil quality and offering habitat for numerous organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer decandrum is a species of maple known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds can be used in traditional remedies. The tree contributes to the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species, which has economic value in conservation and tourism. In some cultures, it is symbolically associated with resilience and growth due to its ability to thrive in diverse environments.</p>
<p>Its role in landscaping and as a native plant supports biodiversity and environmental sustainability.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer decandrum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are highly valued in horticulture.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame', known for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habit. It has been crossed with other maple species to produce hybrids like the 'Autumn Blaze' maple, which combines ornamental value with hardiness. These cultivars and hybrids are prized for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer decandrum plays a significant role in landscape design due to its visual impact and versatility.</p>
