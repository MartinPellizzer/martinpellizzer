                    <h1>Ambrosia orobanchifera</h1>
<p>Ambrosia orobanchifera, commonly known as the common ambrosia, is a parasitic flowering plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
