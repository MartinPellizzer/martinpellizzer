                    <h1>Alchemilla perrieri</h1>
<p>Alchemilla perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, which helps to retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Alchemilla perrieri is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high altitudes with cool, dry conditions.</p>
