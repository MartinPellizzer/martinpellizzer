                <h1>Acacia × tristis</h1>
<p>Acacia × tristis, commonly known as the weeping acacia, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Acacia robusta and Acacia decurrens.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive weeping habit, with long, pendulous branches that droop gracefully. The plant produces yellow globular flowers, which are followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. Native to Australia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental species.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and adaptability have contributed to its widespread cultivation in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia × tristis has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, rounded leaflets arranged in pairs along the stems, giving them a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, and they are alternate in arrangement, with each leaflet measuring about 1–2 cm in length. The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually a dull gray or brown, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are yellow and consist of a single globular head made up of numerous small, sessile flowers, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their small, lightweight nature.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia × tristis is a hybrid plant native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, where it occurs naturally in the coastal regions of the Eastern Cape.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes cultivation in various parts of the world, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions with suitable climates. It thrives in open, sunny environments such as coastal dunes, sandy soils, and disturbed areas. Acacia × tristis typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its widespread cultivation and adaptability, it is not considered threatened and is generally listed as a species of least concern in terms of conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia × tristis is a hybrid legume known for its hardy nature and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring scarification for better germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in spring and regular pruning to maintain shape are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or root rot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with legumes or nitrogen-fixing plants can enhance its growth and health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
