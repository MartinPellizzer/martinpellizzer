                <h1>Actinella fastigiata</h1>
<p>Actinella fastigiata, commonly known as the tall cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the high mountain regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. This plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Actinella fastigiata produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are often pink or white, which bloom in late summer.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella fastigiata has leaves that are elongated, linear, and slightly pointed, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a dark green color and a narrow width.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows vertically in a shrub-like form. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered at the base of the leaves, with a pale greenish-white color, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it splits open, and the seeds are tiny, winged structures that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella fastigiata is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of the country, particularly in the South Island. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with the presence of mosses and other ground-covering vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella fastigiata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, upright growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often along stream banks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists in the region.</p>
