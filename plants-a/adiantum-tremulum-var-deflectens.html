                    <h1>Adiantum tremulum var. deflectens</h1>
<p>Adiantum tremulum var. deflectens, commonly known as the wandering spleen, is a delicate fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that often trail from the plant, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant features small, bright green leaves with a finely toothed margin, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found growing along stream banks or in woodland areas.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ability to spread via runners, contributing to its common name.</p>
