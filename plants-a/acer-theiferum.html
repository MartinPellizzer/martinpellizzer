                <h1>Acer theiferum</h1>
<p>Acer theiferum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red foliage in autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small and green, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>Acer theiferum typically grows to a height of 10â€“25 meters and thrives in a variety of soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer theiferum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a samara, a winged seed case that disperses by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer theiferum is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>While its natural habitat was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations in the eastern Himalayas. It thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity, typically found in dense evergreen forests. This species grows at altitudes between 1,800 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, Acer theiferum is listed as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to prevent its extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer theiferum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant fall color and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle of Acer theiferum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with other ornamental plants like conifers and flowering shrubs.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer theiferum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other plant species. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for land restoration projects.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer theiferum supports ecological balance by offering habitat and resources throughout different seasons.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer theiferum is a species of maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential nutritional benefits. In traditional medicine, it has been used to treat various ailments, though scientific validation remains limited. Industrially, its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, contributing to local economies.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some regions, representing resilience and beauty in natural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer theiferum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Sutherlandii' and 'Meyeri', known for their striking foliage and unique growth habits. Hybrids such as Acer x carpinifolium and Acer x lindenii have been developed to enhance hardiness and visual appeal. These plants are important in horticulture for their ability to thrive in various climates and their decorative value in gardens.</p>
<p>Their adaptability makes them popular choices for landscaping and urban planting.</p>
