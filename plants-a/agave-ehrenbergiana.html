                    <h1>Agave ehrenbergiana</h1>
<p>Agave ehrenbergiana, commonly known as the Desert Agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a white, powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear yellow flowers, which are followed by small, fleshy fruits. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
