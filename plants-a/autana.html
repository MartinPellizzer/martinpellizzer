                    <h1>Autana</h1>
<p>Autana, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus *Conocarpus* and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and exudes a milky sap when injured. The plant has adapted to coastal environments, with salt-excreting leaves that help it thrive in saline conditions. Its small, white flowers are followed by winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Autana make it an important species in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
