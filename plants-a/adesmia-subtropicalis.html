                <h1>Adesmia subtropicalis</h1>
<p>Adesmia subtropicalis, commonly known as the tropical milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, round, greenish fruits that contain seeds with tufts of white hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils near roadsides or in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Adesmia subtropicalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia subtropicalis has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia subtropicalis is primarily native to Brazil South.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of Brazil, particularly in areas with a subtropical climate. This plant thrives in coastal and inland regions with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with dry to semi-arid habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Brazil's southern states.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia subtropicalis was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for coastal and lowland environments. This plant has been commonly introduced for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowering. It is also used in erosion control and as a cover crop in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native habitats.</p>
