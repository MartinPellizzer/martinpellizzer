<p>Athyrium sinense subsp.</p>
<p>longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed lady fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arching and gracefully tapered.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
