                    <h1>Anthoxanthum ovatum var. tenerum</h1>
<p>Anthoxanthum ovatum var. tenerum, commonly known as the soft brome grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous pale yellow to golden florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and adaptability, it is used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop.</p>
