<p>Acrostichum nivosum, commonly known as the snow fern, is a rare and unusual fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, clustered growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, delicate fronds with a pale, almost white or silvery appearance, which gives it its common name. It is often found growing on rock surfaces or in rocky crevices, demonstrating its adaptability to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Acrostichum nivosum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
