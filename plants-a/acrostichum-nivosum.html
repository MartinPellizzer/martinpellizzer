                <h1>Acrostichum nivosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum nivosum, commonly known as the snow fern, is a rare and unusual fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, clustered growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, delicate fronds with a pale, almost white or silvery appearance, which gives it its common name. It is often found growing on rock surfaces or in rocky crevices, demonstrating its adaptability to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Acrostichum nivosum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum nivosum has large, broad, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, measuring up to 1 meter in length and 30 centimeters in width, with a pale green color and a silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark brown, three-winged samara that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum nivosum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of freshwater bodies where the soil remains consistently moist. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems or coastal areas. Its distribution is also noted in parts of New Guinea and the islands of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Acrostichum nivosum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum nivosum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near water bodies or in swampy regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and moderate temperatures. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its invasive potential in certain habitats.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
