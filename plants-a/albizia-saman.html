                    <h1>Albizia saman</h1>
<p>Albizia saman, commonly known as the rain tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that turn bright yellow before falling in response to seasonal changes. The tree produces small, cream-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Its roots have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility.</p>
<p>Albizia saman is often planted for its ornamental value and ability to provide shade in urban and rural landscapes.</p>
