<p>Amyema strongylophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in Australia.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the winter months, which are followed by small, fleshy berries. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria that attach to the host tree, allowing it to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Amyema strongylophylla plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
