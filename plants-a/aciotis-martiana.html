                <h1>Aciotis martiana</h1>
<p>Aciotis martiana, commonly known as the Mexican sunflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant orange to yellow ray florets and dark brown disk florets, which give it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Aciotis martiana is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis martiana has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green color and slightly hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat woody at the base, with a rough texture and a grayish-brown color, exhibiting a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are clustered in racemes, with yellow petals and a prominent central disk, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis martiana is primarily native to South America, specifically found in countries such as Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in open grasslands and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly found in the Pantanal wetland area, which spans across Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Aciotis martiana is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis martiana was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed forests.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a temperate to subtropical climate. This plant is often invasive in non-native ranges due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It spreads primarily through wind-dispersed seeds and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in several regions where it has established itself aggressively.</p>
