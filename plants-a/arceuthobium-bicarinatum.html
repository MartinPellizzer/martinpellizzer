                    <h1>Arceuthobium bicarinatum</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium bicarinatum, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a holoparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish, leafless stems. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found growing on the roots of various grasses and shrubs in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
