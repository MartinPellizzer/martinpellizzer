                    <h1>Aloe gerstneri</h1>
<p>Aloe gerstneri, commonly known as the Gerstner's aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow to orange flowers, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Aloe gerstneri is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy.</p>
