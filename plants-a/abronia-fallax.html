                        <h1>Abronia fallax</h1>
<p>Abronia fallax, commonly known as the Florida beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, coastal environments. The plant produces small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Abronia fallax is adapted to salt spray and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia fallax is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and sandy soils along the Pacific coast. This plant thrives in areas with mild, wet winters and dry summers. It is often associated with dunes and other coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia fallax was mainly introduced to the western coast of the United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils where it thrives in full sun. This plant is known for its small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sand dunes.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
