                    <h1>Apera spica-venti f. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Apera spica-venti f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf windgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, tufted stems that are typically less than 10 cm in height, making it a compact and delicate plant. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
