                <h1>Acinodendron pseudocentrophorum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron pseudocentrophorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenia, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pseudocentrophorum has compound leaves that are pinnate, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, typically 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that has a slightly fissured texture. It produces small, clustered white flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pseudocentrophorum is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa, particularly in countries such as Cameroon, Gabon, and the Central African Republic.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these dense forests. The plant is commonly found in the understory layer, where it relies on the canopy for light and moisture. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that provide the necessary conditions for its growth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pseudocentrophorum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded understory environments, making it a common sight in secondary forests and along forest edges. The plant is often found in regions with high humidity and consistent rainfall, such as parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its introduction has been linked to both natural dispersal and human activities, including horticultural trade.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native flora.</p>
