<p>Achillea sibirica subsp.</p>
<p>ptarmicoides, commonly known as Siberian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are gray-green and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and steppe environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sibirica subsp.</p>
<p>ptarmicoides has basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a greyish-green color and a hairy surface. The stem is upright, with a smooth, greenish-gray bark, and exhibits a branching growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense, rhizomatous network, aiding in the plant's survival in dry, rocky habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sibirica subsp.</p>
<p>ptarmicoides is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, specifically found in regions of Kazakhstan, Russia, and Mongolia. Its current distribution includes parts of northern China and the Tibetan Plateau, where it thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. This subspecies typically grows in rocky soils and open grasslands at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,500 meters.</p>
<p>It is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although its habitat faces threats from climate change and land-use alterations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea sibirica subsp.</p>
<p>ptarmicoides is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a long growth cycle, blooming from late spring to early summer and maintaining its foliage throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
