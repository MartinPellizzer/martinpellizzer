                    <h1>Azorella trifoliolata</h1>
<p>Azorella trifoliolata, commonly known as the Chilean cushion plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that forms dense cushions of foliage, which help it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant has small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs, providing insulation against cold and wind. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typically appearing in late summer.</p>
<p>Azorella trifoliolata is well adapted to rocky, nutrient-poor soils and plays an important ecological role in its alpine habitat.</p>
