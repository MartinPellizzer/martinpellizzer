                    <h1>Alloiatheros aristatus</h1>
<p>Alloiatheros aristatus, commonly known as the spike-spike fern, is a rare and unusual member of the fern family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spike-like fronds that are both upright and densely clustered. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the fronds, making it less visible during the growing season.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
