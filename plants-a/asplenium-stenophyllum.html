<p>Asplenium stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. This plant is often found growing in rocky or crevice habitats, preferring moist and shaded environments. Asplenium stenophyllum has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in crevices and absorb nutrients from the surrounding substrate.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
