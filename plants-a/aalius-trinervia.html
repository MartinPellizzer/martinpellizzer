<p>Aalius trinervia, commonly known as the three-veined fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided segments that contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Aalius trinervia plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
