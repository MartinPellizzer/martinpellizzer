<p>Acantholimon glumaceum var. breviscapum, commonly known as the short-stemmed flaxvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers.

<p>This variety is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon glumaceum var. breviscapum is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of these regions. It is often seen in areas with mild, wet winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific coastal areas along the Pacific coast.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon glumaceum var. breviscapum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
