<p>Alisma geyeri var. giganteum, commonly known as the giant water plant, is a variant of the water plantain native to certain regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds. The plant features broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, aiding in photosynthesis. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters, typically from late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomatous root system helps it spread and establish itself in aquatic habitats.</p>
