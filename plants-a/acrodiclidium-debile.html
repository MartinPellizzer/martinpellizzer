<p>Acrodiclidium debile, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acrodiclidium debile is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
