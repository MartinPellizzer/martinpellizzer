                <h1>Actaea erythrocarpa</h1>
<p>Actaea erythrocarpa, commonly known as redfruit bugbane, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and showy, spiny seed pods that persist into winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea erythrocarpa has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are broadly ovate to ovate-lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and reddish-brown, with a slightly woody texture, and grows upright with a single main stem. The flowers are white to pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry containing small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by birds and mammals eating the berries.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant to store nutrients and survive in shaded, moist environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea erythrocarpa is primarily native to Altay, Amur, Buryatiya, China North-Central, Chita, East European Russia, Finland, Inner Mongolia, Irkutsk, Japan, Kamchatka, Kazakhstan, Khabarovsk, Korea, Krasnoyarsk, Kuril Is., Manchuria, Mongolia, North European Russia, Northwest European Russia, Primorye, Sakhalin, Sweden, Tuva, West Siberia, Yakutiya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas and mountainous regions across these regions. The plant thrives in temperate to subarctic climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It is known for its striking red berries and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its wide distribution reflects its adaptability to various ecological conditions across Eurasia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea erythrocarpa was mainly introduced to the Baltic States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive red berries and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in gardens and disturbed areas across Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. The plant's introduction has raised concerns due to its potential invasiveness and impact on native flora. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered a non-native species in these regions.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor its spread and manage its distribution to prevent ecological harm.</p>
