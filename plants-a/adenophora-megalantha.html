                <h1>Adenophora megalantha</h1>
<p>Adenophora megalantha, commonly known as the large-flowered bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called capsules, which contain numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adenophora megalantha is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora megalantha has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, somewhat hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are showy, bell-shaped, and clustered in inflorescences, displaying a pale blue to lavender color, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, aiding in water and nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora megalantha is primarily native to eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate regions, particularly in mountainous areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in forested environments and is often associated with rocky or partially shaded habitats. It is a perennial herb that can be found in both wild and cultivated settings.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to the climate and ecological conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora megalantha was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as gardening and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates, particularly in the Pacific Northwest of North America. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a non-native but not highly invasive species in most regions.</p>
