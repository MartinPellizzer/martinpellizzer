                <h1>Adenophorus abietinus</h1>
<p>Adenophorus abietinus, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the high altitudes of the European Alps and other mountainous regions of Europe. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with succulent, fleshy leaves. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, typically displaying white or pale blue petals.</p>
<p>Adenophorus abietinus is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophorus abietinus has needle-like leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath, arranged in a dense, compact rosette pattern, and measure approximately 1-2 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a rough, bark-like texture that is typically brown in color, and it grows in a low, shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with a yellowish-green color, and they bloom in late spring to early summer; the plant is primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophorus abietinus is primarily native to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the Hawaiian archipelago. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It is an important component of the native flora in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is limited and it is considered a rare species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophorus abietinus was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread across several states. This plant is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. It has become a common sight in natural areas and is often considered an invasive species.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have contributed to its widespread distribution.</p>
