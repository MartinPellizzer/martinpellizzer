                    <h1>Aplectra</h1>
<p>Aplectra, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has no leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, which is an unusual adaptation for an orchid. Its flowers are pale green or white, often resembling the shape of a ghost, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Aplectra is critically endangered due to habitat loss and environmental changes, making it a subject of conservation interest.</p>
