                    <h1>Agropyron ciliare var. lasiophyllum</h1>
<p>Agropyron ciliare var. lasiophyllum, commonly known as the roughleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which help it thrive in harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in dry meadows, where it plays a role in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important forage plant for livestock in dryland ecosystems.</p>
