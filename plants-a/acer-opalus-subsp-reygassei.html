<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>reygassei, commonly known as the Reygassei maple, is a rare and unique subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which features palmately lobed leaves with a striking combination of green and red hues.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that aid in its dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>
