                <h1>Acer opalus subsp. reygassei</h1>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>reygassei, commonly known as the Regasei maple, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while its fruit is a samara, typical of the maple genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>reygassei has palmately compound leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside. The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and smooth with a light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, arranged in drooping panicles, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>reygassei is a rare and endemic species native to the high mountain ranges of central and eastern Europe, particularly in regions of the Carpathian Basin. While its native range was historically more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in Hungary and parts of Austria.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, typically found in forested areas. This subspecies grows at altitudes ranging from 700 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>reygassei is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique branching pattern. It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. This species grows best in temperate climates, entering a dormant phase in winter and actively growing in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and encourage growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a healthy garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>reygassei is a deciduous tree that provides habitat and food for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing the overall health of the surrounding vegetation. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape and protecting against water runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shade and improves air quality, making it an important ecological asset in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>reygassei is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal. While it does not have widespread medicinal applications, some traditional practices may use its leaves or bark for local remedies.</p>
<p>In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to the timber and paper industries when harvested sustainably. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in regions where it is native, often representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems also supports biodiversity and soil stabilization in forest environments.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>reygassei has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Ebermeyer' and 'Crimson Queen', known for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habits. It is also used in hybridization to create new varieties that combine the best traits of different species, such as enhanced cold hardiness and improved form.</p>
<p>Hybrids involving this subspecies are often sought after by horticulturists for their adaptability and visual appeal in gardens. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a variety of climates and its role in landscape design.</p>
<p>Overall, it remains a valuable species in both traditional and modern horticultural practices.</p>
