<p>Athyrium decursivum, commonly known as the creeping lady fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Athyrium decursivum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
