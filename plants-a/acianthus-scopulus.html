                <h1>Acianthus scopulus</h1>
<p>Acianthus scopulus, commonly known as the rock heather, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its small, evergreen leaves are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white.</p>
<p>Acianthus scopulus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthus scopulus has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bright green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through a mechanism that allows them to be dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in rocky soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthus scopulus is primarily native to New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is typically found in coastal and sandy areas along the eastern coast of Australia. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly associated with rocky or shingle beaches. It is often seen in the lower elevations of coastal regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within New South Wales, making it a rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthus scopulus was mainly introduced to coastal areas with rocky substrates and high salinity.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with mild climates and minimal frost. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen growing in crevices along cliffs and sea walls. Its introduction has been primarily due to human activity, such as landscaping and coastal development.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in most of its current habitats.</p>
