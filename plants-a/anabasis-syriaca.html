                    <h1>Anabasis syriaca</h1>
<p>Anabasis syriaca, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems that help it retain water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, dry fruits containing seeds. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to quickly absorb moisture from the soil after rare rainfalls.</p>
<p>Anabasis syriaca is adapted to extreme temperatures and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
