                <h1>Acca lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Acca lanuginosa, commonly known as the wooly fruit tree, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its grayish-white, woolly leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, citrus-like fruits. Its leaves and flowers contain essential oils, which contribute to its aromatic properties.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acca lanuginosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spherical, fleshy berry that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by birds and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acca lanuginosa is a flowering plant native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is currently found in a limited area within the Geraldton area of the state. This species thrives in sandy soils and is typically found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. It grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acca lanuginosa is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and fragmentation, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acca lanuginosa is a tropical shrub known for its fragrant, edible fruits and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in climates with mild winters and hot, humid summers.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning after fruiting helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal infections in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acca lanuginosa is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its fruits for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a healthy ecosystem. Its dense growth also helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acca lanuginosa contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and offering shelter to various species.</p>
