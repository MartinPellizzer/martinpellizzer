                        <h1>Abarema levelii</h1>
<p>Abarema levelii, commonly known as the Brazilian flame tree, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Abarema levelii is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral display.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abarema levelii belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some green algae, characterized by their complex cellular structures and ability to perform photosynthesis. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes ferns, horsetails, and their relatives, known for their primitive features and spore-based reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many ancient and diverse species, often with primitive floral structures and a wide range of growth forms.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have compound leaves and flowers with a specific arrangement, including many legumes. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by their distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic bacteria. Its genus is Abarema, a group of flowering plants within the Fabaceae family, typically with small, clustered flowers and often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its species is Abarema levelii, a specific plant within the genus Abarema, distinguished by its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema levelii is primarily native to Brazil North and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical regions of these countries. It thrives in humid, forested environments. The plant is commonly associated with the Atlantic Forest biome.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema levelii was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in regions with warm climates, including parts of Argentina and Paraguay.
