                    <h1>Anthocerastes muelleri</h1>
<p>Anthocerastes muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's horned fern, is a unique member of the Anthocerotales order, characterized by its distinctive, horn-like spore capsules.</p>
<p>It is a tropical epiphytic plant, typically found growing on trees in humid environments. The plant's structure includes a short, creeping stem with specialized leaves that form a rosette. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered at the tips of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Anthocerastes muelleri is notable for its primitive morphology and is of interest to botanists studying early land plant evolution.</p>
