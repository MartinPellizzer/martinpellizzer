                <h1>Achillea speciosa</h1>
<p>Achillea speciosa, commonly known as the showy yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has feathery, aromatic leaves and a compact, upright growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower meadows.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and other composite flowers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea speciosa has compound, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and somewhat woody at the base, with a pale green to reddish-brown bark. Its flowers are flat-topped clusters of small, yellowish-white blooms that appear in early summer, and they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea speciosa is primarily native to the western United States, including parts of California, Nevada, and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky areas and open woodlands. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often associated with coastal and inland mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into southern British Columbia in Canada as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea speciosa was mainly introduced to enhance ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its attractive, fern-like foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in regions with temperate climates where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has the potential to spread beyond cultivated areas and become invasive in natural habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its unchecked growth and preserve local biodiversity.</p>
