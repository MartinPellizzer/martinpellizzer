<p>Acer diffusum, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn bright yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Acer diffusum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams.</p>
