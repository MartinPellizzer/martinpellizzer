<p>Astragalus leptostachys, commonly known as the slender-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, elliptical to ovate leaves that are often hairy and adapted to reduce water loss. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Astragalus leptostachys is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits and is also used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
