                    <h1>Asarca heteroglossa</h1>
<p>Asarca heteroglossa, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bright yellow to golden-green fronds that give it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
