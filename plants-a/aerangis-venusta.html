<p>Aerangis venusta, commonly known as the elegant orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, while its leaves are broad and waxy to reduce water loss.</p>
