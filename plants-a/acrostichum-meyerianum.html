<p>Acrostichum meyerianum, commonly known as Meyer's fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swampy areas or near water bodies. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to tolerate waterlogged soils makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
