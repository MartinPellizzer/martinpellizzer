                <h1>Aegilotriticum sancti-andreae</h1>
<p>Aegilotriticum sancti-andreae, commonly known as the San Andrea's grass, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilotriticum sancti-andreae has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and range from 10 to 20 cm in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and creeping, with a smooth, light green bark that grows close to the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed achene, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to their feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>
