                    <h1>Anacyclus × prostratus</h1>
<p>Anacyclus × prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a compact cluster, which bloom in spring and early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
