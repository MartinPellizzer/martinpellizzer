                            <h1>Alectorolophus × Puberulus</h1>
<p>Common spurge, scientifically known as Alectorolophus × puberulus, is a strikingly beautiful yet potentially hazardous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. Its bright yellow flowers and milky sap make it both visually appealing and a source of caution for those who handle it. Despite its ornamental qualities, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause skin irritation and more severe reactions if ingested. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its beauty and danger, it is important to approach this plant with care and knowledge.</p>
