                    <h1>Aristida dispersa var. nana</h1>
<p>Aristida dispersa var. nana, commonly known as dwarf scattered grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It typically reaches heights of less than 10 inches, with dense, tufted clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, a key feature of its survival strategy in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens.</p>
