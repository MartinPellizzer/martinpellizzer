<p>Atriplex cyclostegia, commonly known as the sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and gray-green foliage, which is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, typical of the Chenopodiaceae family. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Atriplex cyclostegia plays a role in stabilizing soils in sandy environments and is sometimes used in restoration projects.</p>
