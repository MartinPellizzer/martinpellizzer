                <h1>Acrostichum erythrotrichum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum erythrotrichum, commonly known as the red-haired fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense, rusty-colored pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the leaves, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The red-haired fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum erythrotrichum has elongated, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a feathery appearance and a size ranging from 30 to 60 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows horizontally along the ground, forming dense mats. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, blooming from late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, round drupe that splits open to release smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum erythrotrichum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along riverbanks where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant is also present in parts of the Caribbean, including islands such as Cuba and Hispaniola. It prefers nutrient-rich soils and is often associated with disturbed or flooded habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range includes countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum erythrotrichum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. This plant is often associated with disturbed or flooded soils and can thrive in both freshwater and brackish environments. It is known for its dense, bright green foliage and is sometimes used for erosion control in wetland restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
