<p>Acrostichum erythrotrichum, commonly known as the red-haired fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense, rusty-colored pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the leaves, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The red-haired fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
