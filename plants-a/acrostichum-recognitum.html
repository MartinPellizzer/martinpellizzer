                <h1>Acrostichum recognitum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum recognitum, commonly known as the common brake fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Acrostichum recognitum make it an important component of wetland and forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum recognitum has large, feather-like leaves that are typically broad and lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture. The stem is erect and woody, with a rough, bark-like texture that is generally brown in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum recognitum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, riverbanks, and wetlands where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. This plant is also present in parts of the Caribbean, such as the Greater and Lesser Antilles. It is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and can tolerate brackish water conditions.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends from southern Mexico through the Caribbean islands to northern Argentina.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum recognitum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in urban environments where soil conditions are altered. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and can spread rapidly due to its rhizomatous growth habit. Its introduction has led to its establishment in regions outside its native range, sometimes competing with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it is not naturally occurring.</p>
