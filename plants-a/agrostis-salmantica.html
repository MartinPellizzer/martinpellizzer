<p>Agrostis salmantica, commonly known as the Salamanca grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, compact flower clusters.</p>
<p>Agrostis salmantica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
