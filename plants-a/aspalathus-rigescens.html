<p>Aspalathus rigescens, commonly known as the silver bush, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to the semi-arid climate of its native habitat, with small, leathery leaves that reduce water loss. It is often found growing in rocky, well-drained soils and is a member of the legume family.</p>
<p>Aspalathus rigescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
