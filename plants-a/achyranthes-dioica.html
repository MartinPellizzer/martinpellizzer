                <h1>Achyranthes dioica</h1>
<p>Achyranthes dioica, commonly known as sandbur, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is an annual herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture.</p>
<p>Achyranthes dioica is known for its adaptability to arid environments and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes dioica has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, branched, and covered with fine hairs, exhibiting a reddish-brown color and a somewhat woody texture as it matures. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in dense spikes, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elongated seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes dioica is primarily native to southern and eastern Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with warm, humid climates and is often associated with disturbed soils and agricultural areas. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, growing along roadsides, in fields, and in open woodlands. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Caribbean, where it has been introduced as an ornamental or weed species.</p>
<p>Its native range highlights its adaptability to a variety of soil types and environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes dioica was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has established itself in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and roadside ditches. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal via water and wind. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded over the past few decades, raising concerns among local ecologists.</p>
