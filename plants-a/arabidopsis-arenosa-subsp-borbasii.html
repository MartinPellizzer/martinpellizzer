<p>Arabidopsis arenosa subsp.</p>
<p>borbasii, commonly known as the Borbasii mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to central and eastern Europe. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, basal rosette of hairy leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to Arabidopsis thaliana, it is of interest in plant biology research.</p>
