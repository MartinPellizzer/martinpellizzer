                    <h1>Acacia tetragonocarpa f. scabra</h1>
<p>Acacia tetragonocarpa f. scabra, commonly known as the rough acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular (four-sided) stems and compound leaves that are typically covered in fine, rough hairs. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that are clustered in dense spikes, which are a key feature for identification. Its small, leathery seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited to dry environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.</p>
