                <h1>Adenanthos obovatus</h1>
<p>Adenanthos obovatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adenanthos, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal regions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces yellowish-white flowers that attract nectar-feeding insects.</p>
<p>Adenanthos obovatus is a perennial shrub that is well adapted to the dry, temperate climate of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos obovatus has leaves that are broadly ovate to obovate in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a slightly hairy texture, arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are upright and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, featuring white petals with a yellow center, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos obovatus is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the south-western region of the state, particularly in the area known as the Fitzgerald River National Park. This species typically grows in sandy soils and is often associated with open habitats such as heathlands and woodland edges. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with a long summer dry period.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its attractive pink or red flowers that bloom during the warmer months.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos obovatus was mainly introduced to South Australia and parts of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along coastal areas and in disturbed habitats. This plant is often associated with open woodlands and shrublands. It has been introduced as a garden ornamental due to its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions where it can spread beyond cultivated areas.</p>
