<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>mayrii, commonly known as the Mayr's maple, is a rare and distinctive species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring palmately lobed leaves with a striking combination of green and red hues.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range.</p>
