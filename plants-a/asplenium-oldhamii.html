<p>Asplenium oldhamii, commonly known as Oldham's spleenwort, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its small, fern-like fronds.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial or epiphytic fern, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a compact rosette structure with closely spaced, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium oldhamii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in moist, well-drained soil.</p>
