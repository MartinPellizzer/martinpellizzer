                <h1>Acmella parvifolia</h1>
<p>Acmella parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered false spurge, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant features palmate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Acmella parvifolia prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella parvifolia has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, yellow, and daisy-like, with a central disk and ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that disperses seeds through wind, and the seeds are small and flat.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella parvifolia is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Paraguay.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in these areas, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including some regions of the United States and Australia. It thrives in moist, sunny environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This species is typically found at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as data deficient, highlighting the need for further research and protection.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella parvifolia is a compact, flowering plant known for its vibrant orange and yellow blooms.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a short growth cycle, typically blooming within a few months after planting, making it suitable for seasonal gardens.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmella parvifolia is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which feed on its seeds. The plant acts as a companion plant in agricultural settings, helping to deter pests and improve soil health. Additionally, its dense growth habit aids in erosion control by stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Acmella parvifolia contributes to biodiversity and supports ecological balance in its native habitats.</p>
