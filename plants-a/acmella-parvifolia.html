                <h1>Acmella parvifolia</h1>
<p>Acmella parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered triggerplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive spurred petals and vibrant yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and marshes. Its foliage is alternate, with lance-shaped leaves that have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acmella parvifolia is known for its unique ability to attract pollinators with its specialized floral structure.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella parvifolia has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a light green color and a slightly hairy texture, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are tiny, yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming throughout the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant absorb moisture from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella parvifolia is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the understory of rainforests. This plant is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of rivers in these areas. It is well adapted to the high rainfall and warm climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it plays an important role in the biodiversity of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella parvifolia was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, including parts of South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in garden landscapes for its vibrant blooms. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain ecosystems, outcompeting native flora.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been cultivated in various horticultural settings around the world.</p>
