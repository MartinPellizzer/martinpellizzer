<p>Arnica nudicaulis, commonly known as the slender mountain arnica, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive tubular shape. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Arnica nudicaulis is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is often used externally due to its potential toxicity when ingested.</p>
