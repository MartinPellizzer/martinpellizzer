                            <h1>Astragalus Hilariae</h1>
<p>Hilaria milkvetch, scientifically known as Astragalus hilariae, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. This species is part of the legume family, known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to ecosystem health. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique plant from threats such as habitat loss and climate change.</p>
