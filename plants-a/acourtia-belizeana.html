                <h1>Acourtia belizeana</h1>
<p>Acourtia belizeana, commonly known as the Belize dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Belize.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its yellow flowers bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Acourtia belizeana is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia belizeana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a light brown bark with a rough texture, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia belizeana is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central America, specifically Belize and southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the lowland areas, particularly in the southern part of Belize. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often associated with limestone soils. It is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia belizeana was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Florida, as well as parts of California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along utility lines. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats and is often associated with sandy or gravelly soils. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native regions, where it can sometimes outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies in some areas, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
