                <h1>Acourtia belizeana</h1>
<p>Acourtia belizeana, commonly known as the Belize sunflower, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Belize.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers that resemble sunflowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching.</p>
<p>Acourtia belizeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its bright, showy blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia belizeana has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a waxy green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring yellow petals and a greenish center, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia belizeana is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America, specifically Belize and southern Mexico.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within its native range, primarily in the southern part of Belize. It thrives in humid, lowland tropical environments, often found in shaded, moist forest understories. Acourtia belizeana grows at altitudes between 100 and 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acourtia belizeana is a unique flowering plant native to Central America, known for its striking blue flowers and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a relatively short growth cycle, blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot, while fertilization with a balanced mix during the growing season promotes healthy growth. Pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms, though it is generally resistant to pests and diseases.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
