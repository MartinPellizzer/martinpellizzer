                <h1>Adhatoda spicata</h1>
<p>Adhatoda spicata, commonly known as the Indian Trumpet or Blue Trumpet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant is evergreen, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas.</p>
<p>Adhatoda spicata is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda spicata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age, exhibiting a creeping growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda spicata is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is now found in various regions of South and Southeast Asia, though its distribution has become more fragmented. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adhatoda spicata is considered to be of low conservation concern, but its habitat is increasingly threatened by deforestation and land-use changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda spicata is a fast-growing, semi-evergreen shrub native to tropical regions, known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within 1-2 years under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and encourage bushiness are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adhatoda spicata is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of neighboring flora by improving soil conditions. Additionally, its dense root system helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil and preventing runoff.</p>
<p>Adhatoda spicata also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.</p>
