                <h1>Adhatoda spicata</h1>
<p>Adhatoda spicata, commonly known as the Indian Trumpet or Spiky Adhatoda, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Adhatoda spicata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda spicata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, brownish bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with some branching. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda spicata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with wetlands and swampy environments. It is also found in parts of southern China and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other regions with similar climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda spicata was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. This plant has been introduced as an ornamental species due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. However, it can become invasive in some environments if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its distribution is often linked to human activity, including horticultural trade and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
