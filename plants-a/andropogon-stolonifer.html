                    <h1>Andropogon stolonifer</h1>
<p>Andropogon stolonifer, commonly known as flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spreading growth habit due to its stolons, which root at the nodes and form a thick mat. The plant has narrow, flat leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat.</p>
