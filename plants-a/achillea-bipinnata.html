                <h1>Achillea bipinnata</h1>
<p>Achillea bipinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat, clustered flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and thrives in full sun and well-drained soils. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Achillea bipinnata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and has historical medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea bipinnata has compound, bipinnate leaves that are finely divided, with a gray-green color and a silvery white underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, with a rough, hairy texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright and branching towards the top. The flowers are yellow, forming flat-topped clusters called cymes, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and feathery structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea bipinnata is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as southern France, Spain, Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula, though it is now considered rare. It thrives in dry, sunny environments like rocky slopes, grasslands, and coastal areas. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Achillea bipinnata is listed as critically endangered in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea bipinnata is a hardy perennial plant known for its attractive, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the root system in early spring. The growth cycle of Achillea bipinnata begins in early spring with new growth, followed by flowering in late summer, and it goes dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea bipinnata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, due to its bright yellow flowers and abundant nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by attracting beneficial insects. Additionally, its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing slopes and degraded lands.</p>
<p>Achillea bipinnata also contributes to biodiversity by supporting a variety of ecological interactions in its habitat.</p>
