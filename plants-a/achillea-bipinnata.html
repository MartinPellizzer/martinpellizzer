                <h1>Achillea bipinnata</h1>
<p>Achillea bipinnata, commonly known as the doubleleaf yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and dry grasslands.</p>
<p>Achillea bipinnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea bipinnata has leaves that are pinnately compound, with finely divided, linear to filiform leaflets arranged in a bipinnate pattern, giving the plant a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green, with a slightly hairy surface, and they are alternate in arrangement along the stem. The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea bipinnata is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in countries such as France, Spain, and Italy.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to parts of North Africa and the Middle East, though its presence is less widespread. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and coastal areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Achillea bipinnata is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea bipinnata is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and vibrant yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The growth cycle begins with spring growth, followed by flowering in late summer, and it enters dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune back spent flowers to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or rust in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea bipinnata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also attracts beneficial insects and birds, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land in various habitats.</p>
<p>Achillea bipinnata offers ecological benefits by supporting wildlife and improving soil structure.</p>
