                <h1>Aconitum hebegynum</h1>
<p>Aconitum hebegynum, commonly known as the broad-leaved aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, it thrives in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum hebegynum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, typically greenish with a slightly hairy texture, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem, with a complex structure featuring showy petals and spurs, blooming in late summer and attracting pollinators like bees through nectar. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fibrous, and adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>
