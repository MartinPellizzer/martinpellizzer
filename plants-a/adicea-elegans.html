                <h1>Adicea elegans</h1>
<p>Adicea elegans, commonly known as the elegant adicea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>Adicea elegans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea elegans has slender, upright stems that are smooth and slightly hairy, with a pale green to reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers.</p>
<p>Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a bright green color with a slightly serrated margin, typically measuring 2â€“5 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with four petals, ranging in color from white to pale pink, which bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea elegans is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically from Virginia to Florida.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. This plant thrives in coastal dunes and maritime hammocks, where it benefits from the saline and well-drained conditions. It is also occasionally seen in disturbed areas and along roadsides in its native range.</p>
<p>Adicea elegans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea elegans was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread rapidly in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and minimize its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
