                    <h1>Astragalus vescus</h1>
<p>Astragalus vescus, commonly known as bitter milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Its seeds are small and typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across dry landscapes.</p>
