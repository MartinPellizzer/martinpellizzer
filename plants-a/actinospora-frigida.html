                <h1>Actinospora frigida</h1>
<p>Actinospora frigida, commonly known as the cold-tolerant liverwort, is a species of moss-like plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with cool climates. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, contain spores that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Actinospora frigida plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinospora frigida has leaves that are broadly ovate, with a waxy, silver-green upper surface and a pale green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a creeping manner along the ground. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, rocky soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinospora frigida is primarily native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes Mountains in South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the rocky and alpine environments of countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. This plant thrives in cold, temperate climates and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. It is often seen growing on steep slopes and in areas with poor soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinospora frigida was mainly introduced to cold and temperate regions where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures, making it suitable for regions with cool summers and mild winters. This plant has been reported in several European countries, particularly in the northern parts of France and Germany. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its limited spread, Actinospora frigida remains a subject of study for its ecological impact and adaptability.</p>
