                    <h1>Acronia volcanica</h1>
<p>Acronia volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils typical of volcanic terrain. Its leaves are narrow and adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Acronia volcanica plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
