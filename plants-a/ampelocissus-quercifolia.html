<p>Ampelocissus quercifolia, commonly known as the African ivy, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or structures.</p>
<p>Ampelocissus quercifolia thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively low-maintenance once established.</p>
