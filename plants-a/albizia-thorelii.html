<p>Albizia thorelii, commonly known as the African white siris, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and showy, fragrant white to pale yellow flowers. The tree produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in savannas and woodland areas, and it plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>Albizia thorelii is also valued for its timber and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
