                    <h1>Artemisia nitida</h1>
<p>Artemisia nitida, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are typically clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Artemisia nitida is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
