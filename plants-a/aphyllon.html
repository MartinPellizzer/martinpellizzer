                    <h1>Aphyllon</h1>
<p>Aphyllon, commonly known as the leafless plant, is a unique species characterized by its lack of true leaves.</p>
<p>Instead of leaves, it possesses modified stems that perform photosynthesis. This adaptation allows it to thrive in environments where traditional leaf structures may be disadvantageous. The plant typically grows in arid or rocky habitats, where water conservation is crucial.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its specialized morphology and ecological niche.</p>
