                    <h1>Anacampseros livida</h1>
<p>Anacampseros livida, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the growing season, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it well adapted to dry conditions.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Aizoaceae, also known as the ice plant family.</p>
