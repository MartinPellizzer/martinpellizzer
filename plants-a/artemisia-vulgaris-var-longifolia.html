                    <h1>Artemisia vulgaris var. longifolia</h1>
<p>Artemisia vulgaris var. longifolia, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and strong, camphor-like scent.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other artemisia species and is used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent.</p>
