                    <h1>Anarthria calovaginata</h1>
<p>Anarthria calovaginata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant lacks leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, which is a unique adaptation to its habitat. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, typically blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited range, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
