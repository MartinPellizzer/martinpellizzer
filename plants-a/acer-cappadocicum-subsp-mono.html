<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>mono, commonly known as the single-leaf maple, is a rare and distinctive species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically single rather than compound.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
