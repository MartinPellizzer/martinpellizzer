                <h1>Actinodaphne blumei</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne blumei, commonly known as the Blume's camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in catkins, followed by elliptical, dark blue-black berries. It is valued for its essential oils, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor.</p>
<p>The species is often found in lowland rainforests and is adapted to humid, warm climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne blumei has simple, elliptical leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 10â€“15 cm in length and have a smooth texture. The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, round drupe that disperses its seeds through animal consumption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne blumei is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly India, and parts of Southeast Asia, including Myanmar, Thailand, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded areas within evergreen forests. This plant thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it a common understory species in humid tropical climates. Its distribution extends to parts of Peninsular Malaysia and the Nicobar Islands as well.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne blumei is also occasionally found in the Andaman Islands, where it contributes to the local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne blumei was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. This plant is commonly cultivated for its ornamental value due to its fragrant leaves and attractive appearance. Its introduction has sometimes led to naturalization in new environments, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
