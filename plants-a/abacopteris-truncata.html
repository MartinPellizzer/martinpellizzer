                    <h1>Abacopteris truncata</h1>
<p>Abacopteris truncata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and trifoliate leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded areas.</p>
<p>Abacopteris truncata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
