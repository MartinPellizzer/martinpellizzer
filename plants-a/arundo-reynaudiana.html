<p>Arundo reynaudiana, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-green foliage and can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant has hollow, jointed stems and produces feathery, grayish-blue flower spikes in late summer. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive.</p>
