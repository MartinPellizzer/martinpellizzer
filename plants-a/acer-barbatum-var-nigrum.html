                        <h1>Acer barbatum var. nigrum</h1>
<p>Acer barbatum var. nigrum, commonly known as the black-haired maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It prefers well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer barbatum var. nigrum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, specifically China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>This variety of maple is commonly found in temperate forests at higher elevations. It thrives in areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with rocky slopes and shaded understories in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its natural range reflects its adaptation to the specific environmental conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer barbatum var. nigrum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its unique dark red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in the eastern and midwestern regions. The introduction of this plant has led to its establishment in some natural areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Despite its aesthetic appeal, its invasive potential remains a topic of ongoing study and monitoring.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its spread into sensitive habitats.</p>
