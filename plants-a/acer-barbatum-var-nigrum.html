<p>Acer barbatum var. nigrum, commonly known as the black-haired maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It prefers well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and seasonal color changes.</p>
