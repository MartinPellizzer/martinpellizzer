                <h1>Aconitum divergens</h1>
<p>Aconitum divergens, commonly known as the European monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with five to nine lobes, and its stems are often hairy and erect. Aconitum divergens contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring caution in handling.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum divergens has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are large, typically 10-20 cm in diameter, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and often covered with a thick, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple spurs, arranged in a raceme, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in moist, shaded habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum divergens is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky soils at high elevations. This species is commonly found in the Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges, where the climate is cold and the terrain is rugged. It is also occasionally reported in parts of northern China and western Mongolia.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and localized plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum divergens was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly in the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It has since become established in various regions, especially in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a range of soil types, contributing to its spread. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued in horticulture for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
