                    <h1>Asplenium × antilahimenae</h1>
<p>Asplenium × antilahimenae, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between *Asplenium antiquum* and *Asplenium trichomanes*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
