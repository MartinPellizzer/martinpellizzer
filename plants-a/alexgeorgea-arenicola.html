<p>Alexgeorgea arenicola, commonly known as the sandhill lichen, is a unique member of the Lecanoromycetes class.</p>
<p>It is a crustose lichen, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces, typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic partnership between a photobiont (usually a green alga) and a fungal component. It thrives in regions with low moisture and high sunlight exposure, often growing on sandstone or limestone.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and specialized habitat make it an important indicator of environmental stability in desert ecosystems.</p>
