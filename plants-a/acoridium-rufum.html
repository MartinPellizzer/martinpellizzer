                <h1>Acoridium rufum</h1>
<p>Acoridium rufum, commonly known as the red-flowered acoridium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acoraceae family, which includes aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are long and narrow, typically submerged or floating in water, adapting to its wetland habitat.</p>
<p>Acoridium rufum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium rufum has leaves that are elongated, narrow, and blade-like, arranged in a helical pattern along the stem, with a bright green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium rufum is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly Florida and Texas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. This plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often associated with disturbed or transitional habitats. It is also present in parts of Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>Acoridium rufum plays an important role in aquatic and wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium rufum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, where it thrives in areas with limited competition. The plant's ability to spread rapidly has led to its establishment in regions outside its native range. It is often considered an invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now expanding as a result of intentional planting and accidental dispersal.</p>
