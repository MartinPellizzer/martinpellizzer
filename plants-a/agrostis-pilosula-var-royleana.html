<p>Agrostis pilosula var. royleana, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry blades and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which allows it to thrive in rocky and arid environments. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance and aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to poor soils.</p>
