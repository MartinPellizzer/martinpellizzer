                        <h1>Acacia derwentii</h1>
<p>Acacia derwentii, commonly known as the Derwent acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stem and small, bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to spines in mature plants. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that appear in late winter to early spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The wood of Acacia derwentii is hard and durable, historically used by indigenous communities for tool-making and construction.</p>
