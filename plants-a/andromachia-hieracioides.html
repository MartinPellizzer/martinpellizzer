<p>Andromachia hieracioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. Its succulent leaves help it conserve water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment.</p>
<p>Andromachia hieracioides is often found in sandy soils and is considered an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
