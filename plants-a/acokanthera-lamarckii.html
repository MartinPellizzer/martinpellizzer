                <h1>Acokanthera lamarckii</h1>
<p>Acokanthera lamarckii, commonly known as the poison arrow tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many plants with milky sap and toxic properties. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant produces a milky latex that is highly poisonous.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic compounds, it has been traditionally used in the preparation of poison-tipped arrows by indigenous communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acokanthera lamarckii has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera lamarckii is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Senegal, Gambia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist lowland forests and swampy areas. This plant is also present in parts of southern and eastern Africa, including Tanzania, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained to slightly waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Acokanthera lamarckii is known for its toxic properties and has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of poisons for hunting.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera lamarckii was mainly introduced to new environments as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in various regions with suitable climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. The introduction of this species has raised concerns due to its potential invasiveness and impact on native ecosystems. Despite its aesthetic value, its spread requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed habitats, which contributes to its ability to colonize new areas rapidly.</p>
