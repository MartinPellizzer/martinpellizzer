<p>Acokanthera lamarckii, commonly known as the poison arrow tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many plants with milky sap and toxic properties. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant produces a milky latex that is highly poisonous.</p>
