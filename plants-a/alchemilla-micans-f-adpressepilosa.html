                    <h1>Alchemilla micans f. adpressepilosa</h1>
<p>Alchemilla micans f. adpressepilosa, commonly known as the velvet-leaved lady's mantle, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb with dense, mat-forming foliage.</p>
<p>Its leaves are broadly ovate to round, with a soft, velvety texture due to the presence of fine, short hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, arranged in loose clusters atop the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland gardens or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The variety adpressepilosa is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and denser foliage compared to the typical form.</p>
