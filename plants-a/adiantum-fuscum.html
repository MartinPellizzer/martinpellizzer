                <h1>Adiantum fuscum</h1>
<p>Adiantum fuscum, commonly known as the rusty maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a rusty or reddish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with each leaflet (pinna) having a narrow, linear shape.</p>
<p>Adiantum fuscum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum fuscum has fern-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure between 10 to 30 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a delicate, finely divided structure. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is smooth and grayish in color, growing from a rhizome. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-yellow in color, appearing in early spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's spread.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum fuscum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, India, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in humid forests and mountainous areas. This species thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often associated with rocky or forested habitats. It is also known to occur in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Adiantum fuscum is a versatile fern that adapts well to a variety of microhabitats within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum fuscum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been reported in Oregon and Washington, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant is often found in forest understories and along stream banks. Its introduction is likely due to human activity, such as horticultural trade or accidental spread.</p>
<p>It is considered a non-native species in these areas, though it has become established in the local ecosystem.</p>
