<p>Aristolochia pallida, commonly known as the yellow Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a strong, unpleasant odor to attract its primary pollinator, the carrion beetle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>The genus Aristolochia includes many species with similar morphological features and ecological roles.</p>
