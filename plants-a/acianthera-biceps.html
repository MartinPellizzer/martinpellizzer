                <h1>Acianthera biceps</h1>
<p>Acianthera biceps, commonly known as the two-armed orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, with two distinct arms or lobes on each petal. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink.</p>
<p>Acianthera biceps is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera biceps has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically measuring around 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanging throughout the plant's life. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and a tubular structure that facilitates pollination by small insects such as flies and beetles, primarily during the summer months. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera biceps is primarily native to Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the Andean foothills and cloud forests. This orchid species thrives in humid, shaded environments with high biodiversity. Its native distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Ecuador's diverse ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acianthera biceps is an important part of the local flora and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera biceps was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned fields. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often seen in regions with seasonal rainfall patterns. Its introduction has been documented in several parts of Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and parts of South America.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become a common ornamental species in horticulture.</p>
