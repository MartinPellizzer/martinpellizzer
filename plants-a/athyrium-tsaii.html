<p>Athyrium tsaii, commonly known as the Tsai's lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous sheath, which helps anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
