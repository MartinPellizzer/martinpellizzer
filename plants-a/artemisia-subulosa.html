                    <h1>Artemisia subulosa</h1>
<p>Artemisia subulosa, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Artemisia subulosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to dry, rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
