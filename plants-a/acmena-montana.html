                <h1>Acmena montana</h1>
<p>Acmena montana, commonly known as the mountain acmena, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded areas of rainforests and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Acmena montana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing food for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena montana has simple, elliptic to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are borne in clusters, have five petals, and bloom during the summer months, being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical berry that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena montana is primarily native to eastern Australia, including parts of New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in subtropical and tropical rainforests, often growing in shaded, moist environments. This species thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is typically associated with coastal and mountainous regions within its native range.</p>
<p>Acmena montana is an important component of the understorey vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena montana was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in regions with a subtropical or tropical climate. The plant is often cultivated for its glossy leaves and ability to thrive in partial shade. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread in non-native habitats.</p>
