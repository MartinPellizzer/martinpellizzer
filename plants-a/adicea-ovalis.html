                <h1>Adicea ovalis</h1>
<p>Adicea ovalis, commonly known as the oval leaf adicea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like species. The plant is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Adicea ovalis is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique floral structure.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea ovalis has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically 2â€“5 cm in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, erect, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, bloom during the spring, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea ovalis is primarily native to South America, specifically found in countries such as Brazil, Peru, and Colombia.</p>
<p>It is commonly associated with tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is typically found in the understory of rainforests, where it thrives in high humidity and partial sunlight. Its distribution is largely confined to the Amazon Basin and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Adicea ovalis is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea ovalis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1970s and has since spread throughout the North Island. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Its introduction is believed to be due to human activity, such as the movement of contaminated soil or horticultural materials.</p>
<p>It is considered a potential weed in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas.</p>
