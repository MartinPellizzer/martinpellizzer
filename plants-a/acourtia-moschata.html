                <h1>Acourtia moschata</h1>
<p>Acourtia moschata, commonly known as the musk acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, linear leaves. It produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acourtia moschata is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia moschata has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a pale greenish-brown bark that remains smooth as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia moschata is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Northeast, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in regions characterized by arid and semi-arid climates. It thrives in rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Acourtia moschata is well adapted to the environmental conditions of these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific areas within Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia moschata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and land development.</p>
<p>It has established itself in various regions, often in disturbed soils and open areas. The plant's spread has been facilitated by its ability to thrive in a range of environmental conditions. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful monitoring is necessary to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
