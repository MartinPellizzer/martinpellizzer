<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia moschata has leaves that are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, winged seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
