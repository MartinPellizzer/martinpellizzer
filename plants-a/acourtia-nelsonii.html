                <h1>Acourtia nelsonii</h1>
<p>Acourtia nelsonii, commonly known as Nelson's acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Acourtia nelsonii is often found in coastal and inland deserts, showcasing its resilience to harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia nelsonii has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>Its root system is shallow and fibrous, adapted to nutrient-poor soils and arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia nelsonii is primarily native to Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. It is commonly associated with desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific locations within this geographic range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia nelsonii was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of California, particularly in the northern part of the state.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy and rocky habitats along the shoreline. This plant is often associated with dunes and other coastal environments where it can thrive in salty and windy conditions. It has become an important part of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has also raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
