                    <h1>Acacia lanei</h1>
<p>Acacia lanei, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, globular inflorescences, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its seed pods are elongated and woody, containing numerous small, hard seeds.</p>
<p>Acacia lanei plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
