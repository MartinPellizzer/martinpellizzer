                <h1>Acer dasycarpum weiri-laciniatum</h1>
<p>Acer dasycarpum weiri-laciniatum, commonly known as the Weiri-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The plant's unique foliage and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for landscaped gardens and urban settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum weiri-laciniatum has compound leaves that are palmately lobed, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface that turns red in autumn; the leaves are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated and have a simple structure with four sepals and four petals. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread efficiently.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum weiri-laciniatum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan and Hubei.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates. This plant typically grows in mixed forests at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation and habitat fragmentation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum weiri-laciniatum is a unique maple variety known for its ornamental value and distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like ferns or heathers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum weiri-laciniatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity through its canopy structure. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding land.</p>
<p>It plays a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by offering ecological benefits that support a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum weiri-laciniatum is a less commonly studied plant, primarily noted for its ornamental value in horticulture due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may have potential in traditional herbal medicine for its reported anti-inflammatory properties. Its wood, though not extensively utilized industrially, could be considered for small-scale woodworking or crafts. Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local communities where it is native, representing resilience or natural beauty.</p>
<p>Further research is needed to fully explore its economic and medicinal potential.</p>
