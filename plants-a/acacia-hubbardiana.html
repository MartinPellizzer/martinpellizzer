                    <h1>Acacia hubbardiana</h1>
<p>Acacia hubbardiana, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow to golden yellow flowers in clusters, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Acacia hubbardiana is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems and a high tolerance for heat and poor soil.</p>
<p>It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>
