<p>Anathallis asperilinguis, commonly known as the rough-tongued spider orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a spurred labellum adapted for pollination by specific insects. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on decomposing organic matter. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with a dense, hairy coating, which helps retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Anathallis asperilinguis is noted for its specialized relationship with certain species of flies, which are its primary pollinators.</p>
