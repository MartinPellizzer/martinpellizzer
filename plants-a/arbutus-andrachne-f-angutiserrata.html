                    <h1>Arbutus andrachne f. angutiserrata</h1>
<p>Arbutus andrachne f. angutiserrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bearberry, is a subspecies of the bearberry plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically narrow and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its often harsh, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
