                    <h1>Aloe buhrii</h1>
<p>Aloe buhrii, commonly known as the "lizard's tail," is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are adorned with white or yellow tubercles. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Aloe buhrii is adapted to survive in drought conditions, storing water in its thick leaves.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
