<p>Adonis vernalis var. acutiflora, commonly known as the spring adonis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its short, stout stems that rise from the ground to bear the blooms. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and early flowering, it is cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, early-season display.</p>
