                    <h1>Agalinis levigata</h1>
<p>Agalinis levigata, commonly known as the smooth agalinis, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and roadside ditches. The plant has slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, and its small, pale blue to lavender flowers appear in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that release tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Agalinis levigata plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered an indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
