                    <h1>Agrostis canina var. stolonifera</h1>
<p>Agrostis canina var. stolonifera, commonly known as the bentgrass or creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread horizontally and form dense mats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its fine texture and ability to withstand foot traffic make it a popular choice for turfgrass applications.</p>
