<p>Arenaria neelgherrensis, commonly known as the Neelgherrensis sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
