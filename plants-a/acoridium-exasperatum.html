                <h1>Acoridium exasperatum</h1>
<p>Acoridium exasperatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowhead, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the substrate, while its leaves provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Acoridium exasperatum is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium exasperatum has leaves that are typically lance-shaped, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, usually ranging from 10 to 20 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that exhibits a slight fibrous texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, featuring a greenish-yellow color, and bloom during the spring season; they are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium exasperatum is primarily native to the western and central regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This plant typically grows in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained to moderately moist soils.</p>
<p>Acoridium exasperatum is often associated with shaded undergrowth in dense forest environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium exasperatum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of South Africa, where it has become established in sandy and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found along the shores of False Bay and the West Coast, thriving in the mild, temperate climate. The plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It spreads primarily through its rhizomes and seeds dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
