<p>Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus subsp.</p>
<p>albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered crassula, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often borne on short, lateral branches. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range.</p>
