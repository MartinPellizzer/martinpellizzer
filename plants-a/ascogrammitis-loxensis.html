<p>Ascogrammitis loxensis, commonly known as the Loxense water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its rhizomes form a network that anchors it to substrates and facilitates nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
