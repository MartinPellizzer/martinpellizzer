                    <h1>Achillea absinthifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea absinthifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, gray-green leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its historical use in herbal medicine and as a source of absinthe is closely tied to its botanical characteristics.</p>
