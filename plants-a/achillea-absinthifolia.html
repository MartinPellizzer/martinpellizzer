                <h1>Achillea absinthifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea absinthifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, gray-green leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its historical use in herbal medicine and as a source of absinthe is closely tied to its botanical characteristics.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea absinthifolia has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and covered with fine hairs, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in flat-topped clusters called cymes, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea absinthifolia is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly the Pyrenees and the Alps.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Spain, France, Italy, and Switzerland, though it has been introduced to other areas with similar climates. This species thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>The conservation status of Achillea absinthifolia is considered stable, though it is vulnerable to habitat loss and overgrazing in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea absinthifolia is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity within two to three years, and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Regular watering is needed during dry periods, but it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune spent flowers to encourage rebloom. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
