                <h1>Adiantum nervosum</h1>
<p>Adiantum nervosum, commonly known as the veined maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are deeply divided and have a distinctive veining pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, which helps in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>Adiantum nervosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum nervosum has delicate, finely divided leaves that are typically triangular in shape, arranged in a feather-like pattern along the stem, and measure about 10-15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green, with a smooth texture and a pale underside. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a single, unbranched pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters during late spring, with yellowish-green structures that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum nervosum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in forested areas with high humidity. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and New Guinea.</p>
<p>Adiantum nervosum is a versatile plant that adapts well to various microhabitats within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum nervosum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in temperate climates, particularly in the eastern United States. It is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its delicate fronds.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
