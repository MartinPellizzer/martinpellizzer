                <h1>Actephila championiae</h1>
<p>Actephila championiae, commonly known as the Champion's actephila, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies, where it relies on specific ecological conditions for survival. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth surface, and the flowers are often white or pale pink, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Actephila championiae is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila championiae has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat hairy, with a pale greenish-brown color and a climbing growth pattern that allows it to ascend trees or shrubs. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale pink, consisting of five petals and five sepals, and bloom from April to June, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant to the substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila championiae is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state. This plant typically grows in rainforests and moist woodland areas. It is often associated with rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Queensland's northern and central regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila championiae was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in moist, shaded areas along the edges of forests and in disturbed habitats. The plant's introduction is likely due to accidental dispersal through human activities or natural wind transport. It has shown adaptability to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, its spread is currently limited and does not pose a significant threat to native plant communities.</p>
