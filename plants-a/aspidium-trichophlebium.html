Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation.</p>
