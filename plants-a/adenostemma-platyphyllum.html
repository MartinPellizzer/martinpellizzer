                <h1>Adenostemma platyphyllum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma platyphyllum, commonly known as the flat-leaved milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and typically grows as an erect, herbaceous annual or perennial. The plant features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are clustered in whorled inflorescences, with tubular corollas that are often pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Adenostemma platyphyllum is known for its milky sap and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma platyphyllum has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and somewhat woody with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in loose inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming from summer to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma platyphyllum is primarily native to Bolivia, Brazil North, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Galápagos, Honduras, Panamá, Peru, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed areas, and along roadsides. The plant is well adapted to the diverse climates and soil conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for sunny environments with moderate to high rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma platyphyllum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and degraded grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant has become a weed in several parts of the world, including Australia and the United States. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce prolifically make it a competitive species in invaded ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is often classified as a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
