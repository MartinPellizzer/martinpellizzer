                <h1>Aconitum lasiostomum</h1>
<p>Aconitum lasiostomum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces follicles containing toxic alkaloids, which make it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated margins, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often cultivated in controlled environments for its ornamental value rather than in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum lasiostomum has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, woody, and has a rough, grayish-brown bark with a fibrous texture. The flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, thick, and fibrous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum lasiostomum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant is adapted to cool, temperate climates and is commonly found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum lasiostomum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue-violet flowers and ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>It was first introduced in the early 20th century by horticulturalists who sought to add unique color and texture to landscape designs. Despite its beauty, it has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native plant species and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind and water.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is now classified as a noxious weed in several states across the United States.</p>
