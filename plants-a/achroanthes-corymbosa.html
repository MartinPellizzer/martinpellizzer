                <h1>Achroanthes corymbosa</h1>
<p>Achroanthes corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered star-milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in its native ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achroanthes corymbosa has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in corymbs, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achroanthes corymbosa is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and the edges of ponds. This species thrives in areas with consistently moist soil and high humidity. It is often associated with pine flatwoods and cypress domes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achroanthes corymbosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, disturbed forests, and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and prefers well-drained soils. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
