                <h1>Achyrachaena mollis</h1>
<p>Achyrachaena mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, soft pubescence, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields due to its adaptability.</p>
<p>Achyrachaena mollis is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrachaena mollis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in terminal panicles, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in moisture absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrachaena mollis is primarily native to California, Mexico Northwest, and Oregon.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky soils and open landscapes, often growing in coastal and inland habitats. The species is known for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to the diverse climates of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrachaena mollis was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and construction sites. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded in regions with warm climates and low rainfall.</p>
