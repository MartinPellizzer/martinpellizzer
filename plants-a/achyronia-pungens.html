                <h1>Achyronia pungens</h1>
<p>Achyronia pungens, commonly known as the spiny hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has thick, waxy leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia pungens has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy green color and serrated edges.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a rough, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia pungens is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the Appalachian Mountains region.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. This plant is commonly found in Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia. It prefers partial to full shade and is often seen in rich hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of Georgia and South Carolina as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia pungens was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used as a biocontrol agent due to its ability to feed on weeds. The plant is native to South America but has been introduced to several regions worldwide. It thrives in disturbed soils and can quickly colonize open areas.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive itself in some ecosystems.</p>
