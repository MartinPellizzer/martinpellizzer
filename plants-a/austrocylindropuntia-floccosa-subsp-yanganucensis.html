<p>Austrocylindropuntia floccosa subsp.</p>
<p>yanganucensis, commonly known as the Yanganucensis Cactus, is a rare cactus species native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically covered with dense, white, woolly hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its hairy foliage. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
