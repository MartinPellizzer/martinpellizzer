<p>Acanthophyllum alexandrae, commonly known as the Alexandra's thorn, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its spines serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and also help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum alexandrae plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
