                <h1>Acourtia pinetorum</h1>
<p>Acourtia pinetorum, commonly known as the pine mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Acourtia pinetorum has small, hairy leaves and produces a capsule-like fruit that contains numerous seeds.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in full sun and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia pinetorum has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals that bloom in late spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia pinetorum is primarily native to Mexico Northwest.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in the mountainous regions of the state of Durango. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often in open woodlands or grasslands. Acourtia pinetorum is adapted to the cooler and drier climates of this region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the northwest of Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia pinetorum was mainly introduced to areas with sandy soils and open habitats, particularly in the western United States.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. The plant thrives in full sun and has adapted well to drier conditions. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land development and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species and can sometimes outcompete native vegetation in certain regions.</p>
