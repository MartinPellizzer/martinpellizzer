<p>Asplenium trichomanes nothosubsp.</p>
<p>barreraense, commonly known as the Barrera's maidenhair fern, is a rare fern species native to specific regions in Mexico. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is distinguished by subtle morphological differences from the typical A. trichomanes, making it a subject of interest in botanical taxonomy.</p>
