<p>Agave perbella, commonly known as the blue agave, is a succulent plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing small, white or pale green flowers. Agave perbella is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in the production of tequila.</p>
