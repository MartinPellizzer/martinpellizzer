                <h1>Acer hyrcanum subsp. reginae-amaliae</h1>
<p>Acer hyrcanum subsp.</p>
<p>reginae-amaliae, commonly known as the Persian maple, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall, adding visual interest to gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in temperate to cold climates. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds that aid in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of conservation interest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum subsp.</p>
<p>reginae-amaliae has palmate leaves that are typically 5â€“7 lobed, with a broad, rounded shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 5 to 12 cm in diameter, displaying a vibrant green on the upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form, often forming dense clumps.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread over short distances.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum subsp.</p>
<p>reginae-amaliae is a rare subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in parts of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. While its native range was once broader, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Tien Shan and Pamir mountain ranges.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid to semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. This subspecies is typically found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is listed as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum subsp.</p>
<p>reginae-amaliae is a rare and ornamental maple known for its striking foliage and unique growth habits. It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining cultivar characteristics.</p>
<p>This species has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and encourage air circulation are essential for its health.</p>
<p>While it is generally pest and disease resistant, it may occasionally be affected by aphids or fungal infections, which can be managed with proper care and companion plants like lavender or marigolds.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum subsp.</p>
<p>reginae-amaliae is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in mixed landscapes, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a diverse array of insects and animals in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum subsp.</p>
<p>reginae-amaliae is a rare and ornamental tree native to Central Asia, known for its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and vibrant autumn colors. While it is primarily valued for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture and landscaping, it has limited culinary use due to its small, non-edible fruits.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, its bark and leaves have been used in some regions for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. Economically, it contributes to the ornamental plant trade, supporting local industries in its native regions.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and natural beauty, often featured in local art and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum subsp.</p>
<p>reginae-amaliae has several popular cultivars, including 'Reginae-Amaliae' and 'Sibiricum,' which are prized for their vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value. It is also used in horticultural breeding programs to create hybrids that enhance traits such as cold hardiness and color display.</p>
<p>These hybrids often combine the ornamental qualities of Acer hyrcanum with the adaptability of other maple species. The subspecies is valued in gardens for its unique leaf patterns and ability to thrive in cooler climates.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance lies in its contribution to the diversity of maple trees in landscaping and ornamental horticulture.</p>
