<p>Amyema aquilonia, commonly known as the coastal rock fig, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy berries that are a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and arid conditions.</p>
<p>Amyema aquilonia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native fauna.</p>
