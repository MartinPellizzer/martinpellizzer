                <h1>Acronema johrianum</h1>
<p>Acronema johrianum, commonly known as the Kashmir bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan regions of Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
<p>Acronema johrianum is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronema johrianum has leaves that are opposite in arrangement, ovate in shape, with a smooth texture, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
