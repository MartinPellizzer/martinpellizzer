                    <h1>Allium sativum f. pekinense</h1>
<p>Allium sativum f. pekinense, commonly known as the Peking garlic, is a botanical variant of garlic characterized by its distinct bulb structure and growth habits.</p>
<p>This form is native to northern China and is adapted to cooler climates, making it well-suited for temperate regions. The bulbs are typically smaller than standard garlic, with a more compact and uniform shape. It possesses a milder flavor compared to common garlic, which makes it popular in certain culinary traditions.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is distinguished by its genetic variations that influence its aroma, taste, and storage properties.</p>
