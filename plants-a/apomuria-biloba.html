<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bifurcated leaves, which are divided into two lobes at the base, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a subject of study in plant taxonomy and evolutionary biology.</p>
