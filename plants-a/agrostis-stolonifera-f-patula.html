<p>Agrostis stolonifera f. patula, commonly known as the mat grass or mat-forming meadowgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit, which forms a compact turf. This form is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its fine texture and ability to form a lush, uniform surface. Botanically, it has slender, wiry stems that spread via stolons, and its leaves are narrow with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks.</p>
