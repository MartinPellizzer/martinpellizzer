                    <h1>Abies firma</h1>
<p>Abies firma, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramid-shaped crown and silver-blue needles that are shorter than those of other fir species. The cones of Abies firma are typically conic and pendulous, with prickly bracts, and they mature to a reddish-brown color. This species thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Its wood is valued for its strength and fine grain, making it useful in construction and furniture-making.</p>
