                <h1>Achimenes longiflora var. rosea</h1>
<p>Achimenes longiflora var. rosea, commonly known as the pink flame flower, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant pink to red tubular flowers that bloom in clusters throughout the growing season. The plant features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Achimenes longiflora var. rosea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes longiflora var. rosea has heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size of about 5-7 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its flowers are showy, with a tubular shape and a prominent spathe, displaying a striking pink to rose-red color, blooming from late spring to early autumn. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes longiflora var. rosea is a tropical flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Central and South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to cultivation in botanical gardens and private collections due to habitat loss and overharvesting. It thrives in warm, moist environments with partial shade, typically found in tropical rainforests near streams or in shaded undergrowth. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted natural habitat and threats from deforestation, Achimenes longiflora var. rosea is considered endangered in the wild and is protected in many countries.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achimenes longiflora var. rosea is a vibrant, flowering plant known for its showy, rose-colored blooms.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This tropical plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period during winter, requiring cool temperatures to trigger blooming in spring.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent moisture, though it should not be overwatered. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or root rot if conditions are not properly managed.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>
