                    <h1>Anathallis ova-trochilorum</h1>
<p>Anathallis ova-trochilorum, commonly known as the hummingbird orchid, is a rare and specialized epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features a modified leaf-like structure called a "spathe" that encloses the actual flower. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with a distinctive coloration that attracts specific pollinators, primarily hummingbirds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in the understory of dense tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
