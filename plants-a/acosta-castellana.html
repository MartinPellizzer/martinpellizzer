                <h1>Acosta castellana</h1>
<p>Acosta castellana, commonly known as the Castilian acosta, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and smartweeds. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating.</p>
<p>Acosta castellana is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta castellana has simple, alternate leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta castellana is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes within the Andes Mountains. This plant thrives in temperate to cool climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with mountainous ecosystems and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a regional endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta castellana was mainly introduced to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool and temperate climates. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its introduction to these areas has been largely through human activity, including cultivation and accidental dispersal.</p>
<p>However, its natural distribution remains limited to specific ecological zones within the Andes.</p>
