                <h1>Acosta castellana</h1>
<p>Acosta castellana, commonly known as the Castilian acosta, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta castellana has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a glossy green color and a slightly serrated margin, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta castellana is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high Andean regions of Bolivia.</p>
<p>Its native range is restricted to the eastern slopes of the Andes in the department of Potos√≠. Currently, it is found in a few isolated locations within its original habitat, primarily in the dry valleys of the Bolivian highlands. It thrives in arid environments with well-drained soils and is typically found at altitudes between 3,500 and 4,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat degradation, Acosta castellana is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acosta castellana is a resilient plant commonly grown for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for rapid growth. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in moderate climates and reaching maturity within 2-3 years.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushiness are essential for optimal growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by aphids and root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acosta castellana is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the local biodiversity. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, improving soil fertility and supporting the growth of other plants in its vicinity. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in rocky or degraded areas.</p>
<p>Overall, it plays a vital ecological role in maintaining the balance of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
