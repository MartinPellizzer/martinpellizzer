                    <h1>Arundo purpurea</h1>
<p>Arundo purpurea, commonly known as purple reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are often tinged with purple, especially along the edges, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become invasive in some regions.</p>
