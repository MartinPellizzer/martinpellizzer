                <h1>Acrolasia integrifolia</h1>
<p>Acrolasia integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leafed acrolasia, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive structure that aids in pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Acrolasia integrifolia is often found in moist, tropical environments and is valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolasia integrifolia has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface, and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm long and arranged spirally along the stem. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, blooming in spring, and is pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia integrifolia is primarily native to the eastern and southeastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and parts of Texas.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. This plant is often associated with freshwater habitats and is known for its attractive, showy white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including pollinators and waterfowl.</p>
<p>Acrolasia integrifolia is also sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia integrifolia was mainly introduced to control invasive weeds in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in regions with Mediterranean climates due to its drought tolerance. The plant's rapid growth and ability to establish quickly make it effective for land stabilization. However, it can become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited to areas where it is cultivated for erosion control.</p>
