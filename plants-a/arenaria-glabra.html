<p>Arenaria glabra, commonly known as smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant has small, succulent leaves that are smooth and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters and blooming in early spring.</p>
<p>Arenaria glabra is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its ornamental appeal in rock gardens.</p>
