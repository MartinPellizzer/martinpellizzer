<p>Agrostis canina var. umbellata is a unique grass species known for its distinctive floral structure and ecological significance. This variant of Agrostis canina is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and the presence of umbel-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining soil stability makes it an important plant in grassland ecosystems. Despite its modest appearance, this plant plays a vital part in the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
