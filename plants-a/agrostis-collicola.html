                    <h1>Agrostis collicola</h1>
<p>Agrostis collicola, commonly known as the mountain bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils, often found in mountainous and alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Agrostis collicola is also a food source for various grazing animals and insects.</p>
