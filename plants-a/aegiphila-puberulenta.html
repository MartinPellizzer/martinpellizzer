                <h1>Aegiphila puberulenta</h1>
<p>Aegiphila puberulenta, commonly known as the hairy aegiphila, is a perennial shrub native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or limestone habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in tropical regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila puberulenta has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in fine pubescence, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soils it inhabits.</p>
