                <h1>Acrostichum fasciculatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum fasciculatum, commonly known as the dwarf hibiscus, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in wet, shady environments and is often found in marshy areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum fasciculatum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are broad and leathery, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat fibrous, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a dense, clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum fasciculatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of rivers. This plant thrives in humid, moist environments with rich, organic soil. It is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its native range extends from Florida in the United States through the Caribbean to northern South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum fasciculatum was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in coastal areas of Florida and the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and can spread rapidly in these environments. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native vegetation.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete local plants.</p>
