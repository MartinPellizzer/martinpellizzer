                <h1>Achillea baikalensis</h1>
<p>Achillea baikalensis, commonly known as the Siberian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Siberia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It is known for its aromatic foliage and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Its resilience to cold climates makes it a notable species in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea baikalensis has basal leaves that are lanceolate to elliptic in shape, with a grayish-green color and a hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-gray bark that becomes more woody as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green composite inflorescences composed of ray and disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea baikalensis is a perennial flowering plant native to the Altai Mountains in southern Siberia, Russia.</p>
<p>It is currently found in isolated populations across the region, primarily in the area around Lake Baikal. This species thrives in dry, rocky slopes and grasslands, often in well-drained soils. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat fragmentation, Achillea baikalensis is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea baikalensis is a hardy perennial known for its fluffy, yellow flower heads and fern-like foliage, often cultivated for its ornamental value and ease of care.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer, with division being the most reliable method. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, going through active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a period of rest in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea baikalensis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts various wildlife, including insects and small mammals, which rely on its seeds and foliage for food. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil in sandy or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological balance by promoting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea baikalensis is a flowering plant native to the Altai region of Russia, known for its medicinal properties and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It has been traditionally used in folk medicine to treat respiratory ailments and skin conditions due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial compounds. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its essential oils are occasionally utilized in the perfume and cosmetic industries. The plant also holds cultural significance in some regions, symbolizing resilience and healing.</p>
<p>However, its industrial and economic applications remain limited compared to other members of the Asteraceae family.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea baikalensis has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Marmalade' and 'Purpurea,' which are known for their vibrant yellow and purple flowers, respectively. While hybrids of Achillea baikalensis are less common, some horticulturists have developed crosses with other yarrow species to enhance bloom color and hardiness. These cultivars and hybrids are prized in gardens for their drought tolerance and long-lasting flowers.</p>
<p>Their horticultural importance lies in their ability to thrive in a variety of conditions, making them a versatile choice for landscape design.</p>
