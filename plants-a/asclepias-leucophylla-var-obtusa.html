                    <h1>Asclepias leucophylla var. obtusa</h1>
<p>Asclepias leucophylla var. obtusa, commonly known as the obtuse milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white or grayish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers with distinctive, hooded structures that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its milky sap, typical of the milkweed genus, contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly and plays a significant role in supporting local ecosystems.</p>
