                <h1>Acrocephalus linearifolius</h1>
<p>Acrocephalus linearifolius, commonly known as the linear-leaved bulrush, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is often used in wetland restoration projects to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus linearifolius has linear, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a grass-like appearance, typically measuring up to 10 cm in length and 2 mm in width, and have a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and cylindrical, with a smooth, slightly hairy surface, and grows in dense tufts or clumps. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled capsule that releases tiny seeds through dryness, dispersing by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and anchor itself in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus linearifolius is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of rice fields. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and abundant water. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of suitable aquatic environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus linearifolius was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and gardening.</p>
<p>It has been found in regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. The plant spreads primarily through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and animals. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation in certain environments.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
