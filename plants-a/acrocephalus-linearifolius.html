                    <h1>Acrocephalus linearifolius</h1>
<p>Acrocephalus linearifolius, commonly known as the linear-leaved bulrush, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is often used in wetland restoration projects to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
