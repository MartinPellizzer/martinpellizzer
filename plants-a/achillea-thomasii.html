                <h1>Achillea thomasii</h1>
<p>Achillea thomasii, commonly known as Thomas' yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat, composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes.</p>
<p>Thomas' yarrow is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically for its medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea thomasii has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually gray-green in color, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, slightly hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing in a clumping pattern. Its flower heads are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from June to August and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea thomasii is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California.</p>
<p>It is found in coastal and inland regions, particularly in the northern and central parts of the state. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, and sandy soils, often growing in open habitats such as grasslands and chaparral. It is commonly associated with areas along the Pacific coast and in the Sierra Nevada foothills.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea thomasii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. Despite its initial popularity, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in open habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
