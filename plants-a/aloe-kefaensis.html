                    <h1>Aloe kefaensis</h1>
<p>Aloe kefaensis, commonly known as the Kefa aloe, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their healing properties, though it is not as widely cultivated as other aloe species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Aloe kefaensis is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
