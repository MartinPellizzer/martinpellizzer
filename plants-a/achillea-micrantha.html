<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea micrantha has leaves that are narrow, linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and typically range from 2 to 6 inches in length, with a gray-green color due to a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly woody at the base, with a reddish-brown color and a growth pattern that is usually branching from the base. The flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white petals and yellow centers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant to stabilize in rocky or dry soils.</p>
