                    <h1>Aegilops speltoides var. typica</h1>
<p>Aegilops speltoides var. typica, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, open habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets with awns, which are bristle-like structures. It is known for its genetic contribution to modern wheat varieties due to its wild relatives' genetic diversity.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in agricultural research for improving wheat resilience and yield.</p>
