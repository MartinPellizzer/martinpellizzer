<p>Asplenium bulbiferum subsp.</p>
<p>gracillimum, commonly known as the graceful water fern, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. One of its notable features is its ability to produce plantlets along the edges of its fronds, a trait shared with its parent species.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its humid, tropical habitat.</p>
