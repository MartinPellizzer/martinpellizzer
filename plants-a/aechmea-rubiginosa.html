                <h1>Aechmea rubiginosa</h1>
<p>Aechmea rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant red bracts that surround its showy inflorescence, giving it its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aechmea rubiginosa is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea rubiginosa has leaves that are broad, strap-like, and arranged in a rosette formation, typically reaching up to 30 cm in length, with a waxy, dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, instead having a short, fibrous rhizome that supports the rosette structure. Its flowers are clustered in a dense inflorescence, featuring showy, red or orange bracts with small, white to pink flowers, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind and insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in rocky or acidic soil.</p>
