<p>Anosporum piliferum, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually whorled and covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in buoyancy and protection.</p>
<p>Anosporum piliferum is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the consumption of prey for nutrition.</p>
