                            <h1>Agrostis Alba Var. Scabriglumis</h1>
<p>Scabrous bentgrass, scientifically known as Agrostis alba var. scabriglumis, is a lesser-known grass species that thrives in moist, temperate environments. It is characterized by its wiry stems and coarse, bluish-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. This variant of bentgrass is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along the edges of streams where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Despite its modest size, Scabrous bentgrass has ecological significance, contributing to the health of grassland ecosystems. Its resilience and adaptability make it an intriguing subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
