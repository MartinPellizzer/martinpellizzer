                    <h1>Angelica biserrata</h1>
<p>Angelica biserrata, commonly known as the double-toothed angelica, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in summer. Angelica biserrata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its morphology and ecological role.</p>
