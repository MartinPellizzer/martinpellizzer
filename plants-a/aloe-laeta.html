                    <h1>Aloe laeta</h1>
<p>Aloe laeta, commonly known as the silver aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically pale green with a silvery-blue hue due to a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in spring. Aloe laeta is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its leaves are often used for their gel, which has mild healing properties.</p>
