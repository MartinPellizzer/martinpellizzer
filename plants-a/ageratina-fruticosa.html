<p>Ageratina fruticosa, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to blueish flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall, creating a mist-like appearance. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs, which contribute to its distinctive, somewhat fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Ageratina fruticosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees.</p>
