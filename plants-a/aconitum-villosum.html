                <h1>Aconitum villosum</h1>
<p>Aconitum villosum, commonly known as the soft-hairy monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple to blue flowers that are arranged in a hooded shape, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has hairy stems and leaves with a distinctive palmate structure. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum villosum has leaves that are compound, consisting of several ovate to elliptical leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, typically reaching up to 1.5 meters in height, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age. The flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense, conical clusters at the top of the plant, and bloom from late summer to early autumn; they are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storing nutrients and supporting the plant's growth.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum villosum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Russia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing at elevations between 1,500 and 3,500 meters. This species is commonly found in rocky soils and open slopes, where it benefits from cool, moist conditions. It is also present in some areas of northern China and the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by grazing animals and is considered a characteristic plant of high-altitude environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum villosum was mainly introduced to North America through intentional cultivation by horticulturists and gardeners who appreciated its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shaded areas, often along stream banks or in disturbed sites. The plant has spread beyond its original cultivation areas, becoming naturalized in some regions, particularly in the eastern United States. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems due to its competitive growth habit.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is highly toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
