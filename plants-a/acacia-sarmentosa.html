                    <h1>Acacia sarmentosa</h1>
<p>Acacia sarmentosa, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that form dense mats, which help stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in globular clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval leaflets.</p>
<p>Acacia sarmentosa is adapted to saline and arid conditions, making it a hardy species for coastal environments.</p>
