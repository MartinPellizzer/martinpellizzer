                <h1>Aegiphila arborescens</h1>
<p>Aegiphila arborescens, commonly known as the tree-like aegiphila, is a shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its branching structure, lance-shaped leaves, and small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Aegiphila arborescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila arborescens has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small shrub or tree with a spreading growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals, and they bloom during the dry season, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
