                    <h1>Aspalathus stricticlada</h1>
<p>Aspalathus stricticlada, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, leathery leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Aspalathus stricticlada is closely related to the more commercially known rooibos species, Aspalathus linearis.</p>
