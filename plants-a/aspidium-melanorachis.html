<p>Aspidium melanorachis, commonly known as the black-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often have a bluish tint. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
