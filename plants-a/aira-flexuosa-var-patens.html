                    <h1>Aira flexuosa var. patens</h1>
<p>Aira flexuosa var. patens, commonly known as the spreading false oat, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ability to spread vegetatively makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
