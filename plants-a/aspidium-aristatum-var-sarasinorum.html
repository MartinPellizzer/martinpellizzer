                    <h1>Aspidium aristatum var. sarasinorum</h1>
<p>Aspidium aristatum var. sarasinorum, commonly known as the Sarasin's water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial aquatic fern characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
