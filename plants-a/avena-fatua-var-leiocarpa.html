                    <h1>Avena fatua var. leiocarpa</h1>
<p>Avena fatua var. leiocarpa, commonly known as smooth field grass, is a variant of the common oat that is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and culms.</p>
<p>It is an annual grass that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in a bract-like structure and are often dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>This variant is considered a weed in many agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and ability to compete with crops.</p>
