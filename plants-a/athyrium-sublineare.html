<p>Athyrium sublineare, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese shield fern, is a species native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
