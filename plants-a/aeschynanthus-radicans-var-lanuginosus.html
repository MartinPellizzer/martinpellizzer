                    <h1>Aeschynanthus radicans var. lanuginosus</h1>
<p>Aeschynanthus radicans var. lanuginosus, commonly known as the woolly ivy or velvet ivy, is a trailing evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it a soft, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom throughout the year. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its trailing habit makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and as a ground cover in shaded garden areas.</p>
