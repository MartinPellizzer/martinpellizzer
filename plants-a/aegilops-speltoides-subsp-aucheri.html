<p>Aegilops speltoides subsp.</p>
<p>aucheri, commonly known as the goat grass, is a wild cereal grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, blue-green leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant produces distinctive, two-rowed spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic improvement in wheat varieties.</p>
