                    <h1>Arachnorchis formosa</h1>
<p>Arachnorchis formosa, commonly known as the Fairy Orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that resemble spiders, hence its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive three-lobed lip.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is classified as vulnerable, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
