                <h1>Acalypha saxicola</h1>
<p>Acalypha saxicola, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree with distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters. It is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species for rocky or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and resilience make it popular in xeriscaping and as a landscape plant in dry climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha saxicola has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a bright green color and slightly hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often branching, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with yellow stamens and pale green petals, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind after maturity.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha saxicola is a perennial shrub native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, particularly in tropical and subtropical climates. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. It typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Acalypha saxicola is currently listed as vulnerable in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha saxicola is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions, prized for its vibrant foliage and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seed, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in warm climates with minimal care once established.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and requires infrequent watering to prevent root rot, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in spring, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourages bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with succulents or cacti is recommended to create a low-maintenance, drought-resistant garden display.</p>
