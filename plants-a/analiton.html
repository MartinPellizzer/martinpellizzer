                    <h1>Analiton</h1>
<p>Analiton, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water plant native to Asia, particularly found in ponds and slow-moving rivers.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, slender stems above the water surface. The plant has broad, rounded leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. Analiton is known for its ability to purify water and is often associated with spiritual and cultural significance in various traditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical name, Nelumbo nucifera, reflects its importance in both ecological and symbolic contexts.</p>
