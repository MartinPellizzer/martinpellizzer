<p>Angraecum dives, commonly known as the star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a dark center. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by moths, with long nectar spurs that match the proboscis of specific moth species.</p>
<p>Angraecum dives is also noted for its ability to store water in its pseudobulbs, allowing it to survive in dry periods.</p>
