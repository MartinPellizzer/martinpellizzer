<p>Acantholimon bodeanum subsp.</p>
<p>pilosum, commonly known as the hairy stonecress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>

<p>pilosum belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and their closest algal relatives. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and their allies, characterized by their vascular systems and spore reproduction.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a large group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species. Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants with showy flowers and often succulent leaves. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly known as the leadplant family, which includes many shrubs and herbs. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid regions, characterized by their spiny stems and small, often blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon bodeanum, a specific type within the genus, which is further divided into subspecies like pilosum, known for its distinctive features and habitat preferences.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>

<p>pilosum is primarily native to Iran. This subspecies is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous areas. The plant is adapted to withstand the harsh climate conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is known for its hardy and resilient nature.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon bodeanum subsp.</p>
<p>pilosum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically found in Mediterranean climate regions. It is commonly found in rocky soils and gravelly slopes, where it thrives in dry, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. It has been introduced to parts of California and other arid regions in the United States.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas, where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
