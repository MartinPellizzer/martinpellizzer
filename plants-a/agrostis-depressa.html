                    <h1>Agrostis depressa</h1>
<p>Agrostis depressa, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled or folded, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth habits allow it to spread readily and form extensive colonies.</p>
<p>Agrostis depressa is valued in horticulture for its fine texture and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
