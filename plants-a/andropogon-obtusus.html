<p>Andropogon obtusus, commonly known as bluntleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Andropogon obtusus plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems.</p>
