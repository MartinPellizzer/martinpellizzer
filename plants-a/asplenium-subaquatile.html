<p>Asplenium subaquatile, commonly known as the water shield, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae).</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic fern that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. Its rhizomes are anchored in the substrate, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Asplenium subaquatile plays a role in stabilizing aquatic environments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
