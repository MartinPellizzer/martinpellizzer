                    <h1>Agrostis verticillata var. acutiglumis</h1>
<p>Agrostis verticillata var. acutiglumis, commonly known as the acuteawn bentgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, bogs, and wet meadows, and is often found in temperate regions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are usually hairless or sparingly hairy, with a distinctive acute awn at the base of each lemma.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting diverse invertebrate life.</p>
