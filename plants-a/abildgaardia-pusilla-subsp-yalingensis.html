<p>Abildgaardia pusilla subsp.</p>
<p>yalingensis, commonly known as the Yalingensis bellflower, is a small flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia pusilla subsp.</p>
<p>yalingensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. This subspecies thrives in humid, shaded environments within subtropical forests.</p>
<p>It is commonly found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. The plant is adapted to the cool, moist climate of these high-altitude areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats, making it a rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia pusilla subsp.</p>
<p>yalingensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often associated with temperate climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is commonly found in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. It is particularly adapted to growing in the shade of larger trees, making it a valuable component of understory vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been noted in several regions where similar ecological conditions exist.</p>
