                <h1>Acronychia halmaheirae</h1>
<p>Acronychia halmaheirae, commonly known as the Halmahera acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the island of Halmahera in Indonesia, where it grows in lowland and montane rainforests. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia halmaheirae has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that develops fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, blooming during the wet season, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia halmaheirae is primarily native to the eastern part of the island of Savo in the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>This species is found in the lowland rainforests and coastal areas of this region. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with high rainfall. The plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in secondary growth forests.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution makes it a rare and locally significant species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia halmaheirae was mainly introduced to urban and coastal areas due to its adaptability to disturbed soils and salt spray.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in landscaped gardens and along roadways in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its introduction has been noted in several island nations in the Pacific and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
