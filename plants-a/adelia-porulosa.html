                <h1>Adelia porulosa</h1>
<p>Adelia porulosa, commonly known as the Porcupine Cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, tuberculate bumps. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but striking in appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Adelia porulosa is a slow-growing plant that requires minimal water and is well-suited for rock gardens or arid landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia porulosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a rough, bark-like texture, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia porulosa is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Australia, particularly in the states of New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, often found in dunes or near the edges of beaches. This plant is well adapted to the harsh coastal environment, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Adelia porulosa is a low-growing shrub that is often used in coastal restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia porulosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils. This plant is particularly common in the eastern United States, including states like Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a nuisance in native plant communities.</p>
