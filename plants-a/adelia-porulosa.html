<p>Adelia porulosa, commonly known as the Porcupine Cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, tuberculate bumps. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but striking in appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Adelia porulosa is a slow-growing plant that requires minimal water and is well-suited for rock gardens or arid landscapes.</p>
