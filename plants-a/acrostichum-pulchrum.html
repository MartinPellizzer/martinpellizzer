                <h1>Acrostichum pulchrum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum pulchrum, commonly known as the beautiful brake, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its feather-like fronds that are typically bright green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Acrostichum pulchrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pulchrum has leaves that are elongated, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it grows in a climbing or trailing manner. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pulchrum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is commonly found in lowland areas with rich, moist soil. This plant is often associated with coastal and mangrove ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing shorelines. It is also found in tropical rainforests, growing in shaded understory environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can occasionally be seen in disturbed or secondary growth habitats within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pulchrum was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in regions with high rainfall and rich, organic soil. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value due to its attractive, feathery foliage. It has been introduced to several island nations in the Pacific and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
