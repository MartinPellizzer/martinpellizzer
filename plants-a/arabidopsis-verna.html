                    <h1>Arabidopsis verna</h1>
<p>Arabidopsis verna, commonly known as the early Arabidopsis, is a small flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. This species is characterized by its delicate, four-petaled flowers and linear, grass-like leaves. Arabidopsis verna typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its short life cycle and genetic simplicity, it is sometimes used in botanical studies, though it is less commonly cultivated than its more famous relative, Arabidopsis thaliana.</p>
