                <h1>Actinodaphne perlucida</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne perlucida, commonly known as the translucent laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy, and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by dark blue berries. Its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it useful in traditional craftsmanship.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne perlucida has elliptical,革质 (leathery) leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that exudes a faint resinous scent. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the rainy season, which are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release bright red seeds, dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Its roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the moist, shaded environments where it typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne perlucida is primarily native to Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the southern and central areas. This plant typically grows in lowland forests and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the warm and humid climate of Vietnam.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to specific ecological zones within the country.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne perlucida was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas across Southeast Asia. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and fragrant leaves. It has been introduced to several regions beyond its native range, including parts of the Pacific Islands and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
