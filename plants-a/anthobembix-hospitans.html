                    <h1>Anthobembix hospitans</h1>
<p>Anthobembix hospitans, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically golden in color, especially when young. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in small, cup-like formations on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anthobembix hospitans is considered a conservation concern.</p>
