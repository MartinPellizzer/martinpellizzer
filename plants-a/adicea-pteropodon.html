<p>Adicea pteropodon, commonly known as the winged hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Adicea pteropodon is typically found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea pteropodon has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and reddish-brown in color, with a climbing growth pattern that allows it to ascend supports. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea pteropodon is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific islands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can be found in a variety of ecological zones within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea pteropodon was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban areas, where it thrives in nutrient-rich conditions. This plant has spread across various regions, often outcompeting native species due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to become invasive.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to control its spread and protect local biodiversity.</p>
