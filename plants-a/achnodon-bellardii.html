                <h1>Achnodon bellardii</h1>
<p>Achnodon bellardii, commonly known as the bellard's cress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, calcareous soils along streams and in wet meadows. The plant has basal leaves that are pinnately divided, and its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in racemes. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat preferences, it is often considered a rare or endangered species in many regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnodon bellardii has small, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a grass-like appearance, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length and a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching in a dense, shrub-like pattern. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, with a pale yellow color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnodon bellardii is primarily native to the Mediterranean Basin, including regions such as southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is commonly found in areas with a climate characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on limestone or sandy soils. Its distribution includes countries like Spain, Italy, France, Morocco, and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnodon bellardii was mainly introduced to the southern regions of the United States, particularly in Texas and California.</p>
<p>It has been documented in wetland and riparian habitats where it thrives in moist soil conditions. The plant's introduction is primarily associated with human activities such as land development and water management projects. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded over the past few decades, raising concerns among ecologists and land managers.</p>
