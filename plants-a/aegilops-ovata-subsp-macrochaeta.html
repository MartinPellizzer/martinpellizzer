<p>Aegilops ovata subsp.</p>
<p>macrochaeta, commonly known as the long-hair wild rye, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant produces awned lemmas, which are bristle-like structures that give it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is closely related to wheat and has been studied for its potential in breeding programs due to its genetic diversity.</p>
