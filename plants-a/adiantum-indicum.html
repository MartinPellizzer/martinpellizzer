                <h1>Adiantum indicum</h1>
<p>Adiantum indicum, commonly known as the Indian maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are bipinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shady, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a distinctive, arching growth habit.</p>
<p>Adiantum indicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum indicum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually small, ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, and have a dark green color with a silvery underside. The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, light green bark that grows in a simple, unbranched pattern. It produces inconspicuous, greenish flowers in the summer, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a small, spore-bearing sorus that disperses via wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum indicum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in moist, shaded forest environments. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often associated with rocky or clayey soils. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Adiantum indicum is well adapted to wet conditions and is often seen growing near streams or in marshy areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum indicum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it a common ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens. This distribution is largely due to its adaptability to humid climates and its ability to grow in partial to full shade. It is also frequently cultivated for its delicate, fern-like foliage.</p>
<p>The plant's introduction to new regions is often associated with horticultural trade and landscaping efforts.</p>
