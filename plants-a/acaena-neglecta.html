                <h1>Acaena neglecta</h1>
<p>Acaena neglecta, commonly known as New Zealand thistle, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features spiny, glandular stems and leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red or orange burrs that contain seeds. Its foliage is often used in traditional M훮ori medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Acaena neglecta is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acaena neglecta has small, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, and are typically less than 2 cm in length, appearing dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stems are upright and somewhat woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and they exhibit a bushy growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense heads, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a burr-like structure containing several seeds, which are dispersed by animals that brush against the prickly bracts.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena neglecta is a flowering plant native to New Zealand, where it is found primarily in the South Island.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that includes both mainland New Zealand and some nearby islands, though it is less common in the North Island. This species thrives in a variety of environments, including grasslands, shrublands, and disturbed soils, often growing in sunny, open areas. It is typically found at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to around 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Acaena neglecta is listed as a species of conservation concern in New Zealand due to habitat loss and the impact of invasive species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acaena neglecta is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to New Zealand, known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the existing plant, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle of Acaena neglecta is perennial, with active growth during the warmer months and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization is minimal, and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally pest and disease resistant, though it may attract aphids in some conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other drought-tolerant species can enhance its growth and provide ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acaena neglecta is a low-growing shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, yellow flowers. The plant acts as a valuable companion plant in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its dense growth habit also helps in reducing soil erosion along slopes and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acaena neglecta contributes to ecological biodiversity by supporting a range of native fauna and flora in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acaena neglecta is a flowering plant native to New Zealand, known for its small, spiky fruits and its role in traditional M훮ori culture.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, it has been historically used in traditional M훮ori medicine for its purported healing properties. The plant's hardy nature makes it suitable for ecological restoration projects, contributing to its industrial and economic value in environmental conservation. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance for the M훮ori people, representing resilience and connection to the land.</p>
<p>Its potential for sustainable land management and traditional uses continues to be explored in modern ecological and cultural studies.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acaena neglecta has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson Star' and 'Golden Glory', which are known for their vibrant foliage and compact growth habit. While natural hybrids of Acaena neglecta are relatively rare, some horticultural hybrids have been developed to enhance flower color and disease resistance. These cultivars are widely used in gardens and landscapes for their hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Overall, Acaena neglecta holds significant horticultural importance due to its adaptability and visual appeal in diverse growing conditions.</p>
