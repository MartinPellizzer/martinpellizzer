<p>Achillea glaberrima, commonly known as the rough yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and features basal rosettes of gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flower heads, which are surrounded by pale yellow ray florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea glaberrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea glaberrima has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they range in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a grayish-green color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and attached pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea glaberrima is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is now also distributed in parts of the Middle East and has been introduced to other regions with similar climates. This species thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to around 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>The conservation status of Achillea glaberrima is currently listed as least concern, though local populations may face threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea glaberrima is a hardy perennial known for its feathery foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer to early fall. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, going through active growth in spring and summer, with a rest period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flower stems after blooming to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and care.</p>
