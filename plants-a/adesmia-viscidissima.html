                <h1>Adesmia viscidissima</h1>
<p>Adesmia viscidissima, commonly known as the sticky adesmia, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, sticky glandular hairs covering its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its fruits are legumes that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Adesmia viscidissima is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia viscidissima has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green color and a sticky surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a rough, woody texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, clustered in racemes, and bloom during the spring and early summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia viscidissima is primarily native to Chile Central and Chile North.</p>
<p>This species is found in the temperate regions of these areas. It typically grows in dry to semi-arid environments. The plant is adapted to the specific climate and soil conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays a role in the local ecosystem and is part of the native flora of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia viscidissima was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become established in several regions across the country. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest margins. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to its classification as a potential environmental weed.</p>
<p>However, it is currently considered to have limited ecological impact compared to other invasive species in New Zealand.</p>
