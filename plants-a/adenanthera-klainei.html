                <h1>Adenanthera klainei</h1>
<p>Adenanthera klainei, commonly known as the African burr legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, feather-like leaflets.</p>
<p>Adenanthera klainei is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in challenging climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthera klainei has compound, trifoliate leaves that are pinnately arranged, with each leaflet being elliptical in shape, medium green in color, and ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin layers as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a pale yellow to greenish color, blooming during the dry season and being pollinated by wind. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and helping it absorb nutrients from the sandy soils it typically inhabits.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera klainei is primarily native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodland and savanna habitats. The plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and a warm, humid climate. It is often used in traditional medicine for its various health benefits.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also noted in parts of southern Africa, including Zimbabwe and Mozambique.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera klainei was mainly introduced to South Africa as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and fast growth rate.</p>
<p>It was also introduced for use in erosion control and as a source of fodder for livestock. However, its rapid spread has led to it becoming an invasive species in several regions, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can establish itself in both rural and urban environments.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is now considered a problematic weed in many parts of the country.</p>
