                <h1>Acosta pseudorhenana</h1>
<p>Acosta pseudorhenana, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta pseudorhenana has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white and pink, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, helping it anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
