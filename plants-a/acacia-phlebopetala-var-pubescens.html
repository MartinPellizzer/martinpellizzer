<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia phlebopetala var. pubescens is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>This variant of the species is found in the southern and southwestern regions of the state. It typically grows in sandy soils and is commonly associated with coastal and inland areas. The plant is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in the local flora and is often found in shrublands and open woodlands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia phlebopetala var. pubescens was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it suitable for xerophytic environments. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of fodder for livestock. Its introduction has been primarily for ecological restoration and land rehabilitation projects.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent potential invasiveness in non-native habitats.</p>
