<p>Anthyllis vulneraria subsp.</p>
<p>linnaei, commonly known as the Linnaean broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the legume family. It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, and it is characterized by its slender, branched stems. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
