<p>Aspidium viviparum subsp.</p>
<p>rhizophorum, commonly known as the root fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique rhizome structure. It is a fern that produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are typically clustered in groups called sori.</p>
<p>The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, serving as a storage organ and aiding in its survival in various habitats.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its viviparous reproduction, where sporangia are produced directly on the rhizome rather than on specialized leaves.</p>
