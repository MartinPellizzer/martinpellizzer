<p>Arabis allionii subsp.</p>
<p>sudetica, commonly known as the Sudetic rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Central European region, particularly the Sudetes mountains. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas.</p>
