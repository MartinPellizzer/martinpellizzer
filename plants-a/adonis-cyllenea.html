                <h1>Adonis cyllenea</h1>
<p>Adonis cyllenea, commonly known as the Cyprus bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant produces a cluster of small, hairy fruits.</p>
<p>Adonis cyllenea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis cyllenea has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, dark green, and slightly hairy, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and reddish-brown, with a branching pattern that becomes more complex as the plant matures. The flowers are showy, with yellow petals and a central greenish-yellow disk, blooming in early spring and attracting pollinators like bees through their nectar. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis cyllenea is primarily native to Greece.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Peloponnese and the northern Aegean islands. This plant thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often growing in open woodland and scrub habitats. It is commonly seen in areas with mild, Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Greece, making it a relatively rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis cyllenea was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds and can thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
