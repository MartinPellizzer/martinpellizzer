                <h1>Adenocalymma bullatum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma bullatum, commonly known as the woolly adenocalymma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is a perennial shrub that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with compound leaves and small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and moderate watering.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma bullatum has leaves that are broadly ovate to rounded, with a waxy surface and a bluish-green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and grows as a shrub with a compact growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma bullatum is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the humid tropical regions of this area. The plant thrives in dense forest understories and areas with high rainfall. It is commonly associated with rocky and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the southeastern part of Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma bullatum was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and growth habit. Its introduction has led to its presence in several non-native areas, including parts of the southern United States and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts on local flora and fauna.</p>
