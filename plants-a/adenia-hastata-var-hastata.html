<p>Adenia hastata var. hastata, commonly known as the variable adenia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are often visited by birds and insects.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia hastata var. hastata has compound, pinnate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with lanceolate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is woody with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grey to brown in color, and it grows in a scrambling or climbing habit. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in panicle-like inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, helping the plant anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia hastata var. hastata is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat is primarily found in the humid, cool climates of high-altitude rainforests. While its native range is limited to this specific area, it is now also cultivated in some botanical gardens and conservation programs. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,200 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is currently listed as endangered, requiring careful conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenia hastata var. hastata is a striking tropical plant known for its unique foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant follows a seasonal growth cycle, typically thriving in warm climates and entering a dormant phase during cooler months.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or root rot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like hibiscus or croton can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a healthier garden environment.</p>
