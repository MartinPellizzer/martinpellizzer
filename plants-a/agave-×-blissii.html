                    <h1>Agave × blissii</h1>
<p>Agave × blissii, commonly known as the hybrid agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern, with thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-gray in color. The plant produces tall, flowering stalks that bear clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are typical of the Agavaceae family. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Agave × blissii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance.</p>
