<p>Abies wilsonii, commonly known as the Wilson's fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces cones that are typically 5â€“8 centimeters long, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
