                        <h1>Acer glabratum</h1>
<p>Acer glabratum, commonly known as the coast redwood, is a deciduous tree native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed evergreen forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and limited range, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
