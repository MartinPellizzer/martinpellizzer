                <h1>Acer glabratum</h1>
<p>Acer glabratum, commonly known as the coast redwood, is a deciduous tree native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed evergreen forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and limited range, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer glabratum has palmately compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged oppositely on the stem, and measuring about 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and smooth, with a light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer glabratum is a rare species of maple native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils within shaded, forested environments. This plant typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Acer glabratum is classified as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer glabratum is a small, ornamental maple native to the western United States, prized for its striking red foliage and compact growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. This plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 10 to 15 years, making it ideal for smaller gardens.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent moisture, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications in early spring, and pruning is best done in late winter to shape the tree and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant shrubs like lavender or sage can enhance its growth and provide a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer glabratum is a small, deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The tree also acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of nearby species through improved soil conditions. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer glabratum plays a vital ecological role in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer glabratum is a deciduous tree native to the western United States, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to biodiversity and supports local wildlife, though it does not have significant commercial use. Culturally, it is appreciated in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents resilience and adaptability in natural environments.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer glabratum has several popular cultivars that are favored for their ornamental value, including 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame,' which are known for their vibrant fall colors.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer rubrum, to produce cultivars that exhibit enhanced growth habits and coloration. These hybrids often display improved adaptability to different climates and soil conditions. Horticulturally, Acer glabratum and its cultivars are valued for their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of garden settings.</p>
<p>Their use in landscaping highlights their importance in both residential and public horticultural landscapes.</p>
