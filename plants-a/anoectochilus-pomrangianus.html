<p>Anoectochilus pomrangianus, commonly known as the Pomrangian wax orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Thailand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in primary forests. Its leaves are革质 (leathery) and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
