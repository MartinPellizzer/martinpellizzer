                    <h1>Androsace umbellata</h1>
<p>Androsace umbellata, commonly known as the snow bell or fairy bell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and adaptability to harsh climates, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
