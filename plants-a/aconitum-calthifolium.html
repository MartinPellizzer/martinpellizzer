                <h1>Aconitum calthifolium</h1>
<p>Aconitum calthifolium, commonly known as the lady's mantle aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmate leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and stream sides.</p>
<p>Aconitum calthifolium contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring caution when handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum calthifolium has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, dark purple bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spikes, and bloom in late summer; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a slit, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and store nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum calthifolium is primarily native to Myanmar.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the northern and eastern parts. This plant thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. It is commonly associated with rocky and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat supports a diverse range of flora and fauna in Myanmar's ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum calthifolium was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue-violet flowers and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the continent in the 19th century by horticulturists and botanical enthusiasts who admired its aesthetic value. Despite its beauty, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native plant species and altering local ecosystems. Its spread has been facilitated by its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments and its prolific seed production.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued in some gardens for its unique appearance and historical medicinal uses.</p>
