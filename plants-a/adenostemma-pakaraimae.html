                <h1>Adenostemma pakaraimae</h1>
<p>Adenostemma pakaraimae, commonly known as the Pakaraima milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, making it a plant to handle with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma pakaraimae has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, exhibiting a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a slightly hairy texture, and has a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with tubular petals, typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma pakaraimae is primarily native to the island of Mauritius.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the island, particularly in the central and southern parts. This plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils. It is adapted to the tropical climate of Mauritius.</p>
<p>Adenostemma pakaraimae is considered an endemic species, meaning it is not found anywhere else in the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma pakaraimae was mainly introduced to the African continent, particularly in countries like South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It was initially brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. However, it has since become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its spread has been facilitated by its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its rapid reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its proliferation and mitigate its environmental impact.</p>
