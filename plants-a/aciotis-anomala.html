                <h1>Aciotis anomala</h1>
<p>Aciotis anomala, commonly known as the wild dandelion, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features basal leaves that are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and produce small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Aciotis anomala is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis anomala has leaves that are oblanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dull green color and slightly hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis anomala is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in lowland areas and is often associated with disturbed habitats like roadside verges and forest edges. It is also known to occur in parts of northern Australia and New Guinea.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Indo-Malesian region, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis anomala was mainly introduced to the eastern coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It has become a significant invasive species in these areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and along roadsides, spreading rapidly through seeds. Its introduction has led to ecological imbalances and reduced biodiversity in affected habitats.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
