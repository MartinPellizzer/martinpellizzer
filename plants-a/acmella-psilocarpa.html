                <h1>Acmella psilocarpa</h1>
<p>Acmella psilocarpa, commonly known as the golden cress or false piper, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It has a short life cycle, blooming and setting seed within a few months.</p>
<p>Despite its modest appearance, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella psilocarpa has small, ovate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, typically measuring up to 2 cm in length, with a dark green color and slightly hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is generally branching. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in groups, blooming during the warm season, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella psilocarpa is primarily native to Argentina Northeast and Brazil South.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil. The species is often associated with grasslands and open forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella psilocarpa was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and open areas, making it a potential invasive species in certain ecosystems. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
<p>Further monitoring is needed to assess its ecological impact in non-native environments.</p>
