<p>Arenaria deflexa subsp.</p>
<p>microcepala, commonly known as the dwarf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand extreme temperatures make it a characteristic species of high-altitude and polar ecosystems.</p>
