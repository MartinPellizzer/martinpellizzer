                        <h1>Abronia cycloptera</h1>
<p>Abronia cycloptera, commonly known as the rockdove or desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and sandy plains. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Abronia cycloptera is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is known for its resilience in extreme climates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia cycloptera is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in areas with minimal vegetation. This species thrives in the Mediterranean climate of these regions, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is typically associated with dune ecosystems and is often found in association with other coastal flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Abronia cycloptera is considered a rare and endemic plant species in its native region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia cycloptera was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils along the Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. This plant is often found in areas with minimal vegetation cover and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities in these regions.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
