                <h1>Achyranthes amabilis</h1>
<p>Achyranthes amabilis, commonly known as the Indian knotweed, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which help it store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in moist soils along riverbanks and in cultivated fields.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes amabilis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with pale yellow petals and a short corolla, blooming in the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes amabilis is primarily native to South Asia, including countries such as India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in moist and shady areas. This plant thrives in forest understories and along stream banks, where it benefits from high humidity and partial sunlight. It is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other regions for ornamental and medicinal purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes amabilis was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in roadsides, wastelands, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. It is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become naturalized in many regions outside its native habitat.</p>
