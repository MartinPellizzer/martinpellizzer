<p>Arthrocnemum terminale, commonly known as saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It possesses succulent leaves and stems that store water, aiding survival in dry conditions. The plant has a deep root system that helps it access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. It is widely distributed across the arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
