<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum f. rubrifolium is a variant of the bigleaf maple, native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the coastal and foothill areas of these states. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mixed evergreen forests and along streambanks, typically at elevations between 300 and 1,200 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, it is considered threatened or endangered in many areas.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its populations in the wild.</p>
