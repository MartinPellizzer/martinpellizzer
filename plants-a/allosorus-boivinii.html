<p>Allosorus boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy leaves and delicate, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded forest environments and requires specific microclimatic conditions to flourish. Allosorus boivinii is closely related to other ghost orchids and is part of the Dendrophylleae tribe.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
