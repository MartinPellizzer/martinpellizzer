                <h1>Acinodendron foveolatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron foveolatum, commonly known as the African star apple, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, greenish fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns yellow or red, and it contains a single large seed.</p>
<p>Acinodendron foveolatum is valued for its edible fruit and is also used in traditional medicine for its various therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron foveolatum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron foveolatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas where the climate is warm and humid. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rainforest ecosystems. Its distribution extends to parts of the Indian subcontinent, particularly in regions with similar climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron foveolatum was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. The plant is often spread through human activities, including seed dispersal via vehicles and livestock. It has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
