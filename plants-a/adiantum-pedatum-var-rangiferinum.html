<p>Adiantum pedatum var. rangiferinum, commonly known as the northern maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow in the dark, a unique trait among ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately divided with lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled at the tips.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to tolerate a range of soil types and its role in ecological succession in forest ecosystems.</p>
