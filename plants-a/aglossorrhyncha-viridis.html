                    <h1>Aglossorrhyncha viridis</h1>
<p>Aglossorrhyncha viridis, commonly known as the green leafless orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking greenish-yellow floral structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's unique morphology, including its reduced foliage and specialized floral morphology, reflects adaptations to its ecological niche. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with intricate petal arrangements that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Aglossorrhyncha viridis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
