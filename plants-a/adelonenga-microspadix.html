                <h1>Adelonenga microspadix</h1>
<p>Adelonenga microspadix, commonly known as the small-spadix cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a dense, spadix-like structure that bears both male and female flowers. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, requiring well-drained soil and plenty of sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelonenga microspadix has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops shallow grooves as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green, consisting of five petals and stamens, and bloom in late spring; they are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonenga microspadix is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei.</p>
<p>This species thrives in humid, shaded environments within these dense forest ecosystems. It is commonly found in the understory layers of primary and secondary forests. The plant plays a role in the ecological balance by providing habitat and food for various insect and vertebrate species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, its distribution has become increasingly fragmented.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonenga microspadix was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where the climate supports its growth. This plant has been introduced to several islands in the Pacific Ocean, including Hawaii and Tahiti. It thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become an invasive species in these environments.</p>
