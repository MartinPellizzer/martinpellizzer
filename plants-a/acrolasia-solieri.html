                <h1>Acrolasia solieri</h1>
<p>Acrolasia solieri, commonly known as the red-flowered acrolasia, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking red and purple flowers that bloom throughout the dry season. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are often woody and branched. Acrolasia solieri is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolasia solieri has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, typically measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branched pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, blooming from March to May, and they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia solieri is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often seen growing in the understory of humid forests or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific islands where the environmental conditions match its ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia solieri was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It was brought there intentionally for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas, particularly in disturbed habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is now considered a potential invasive species in some regions of Hawaii.</p>
