                    <h1>Arabidopsis sarbalica</h1>
<p>Arabidopsis sarbalica, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops like broccoli and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. Arabidopsis sarbalica typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its short life cycle and genetic simplicity make it a potential candidate for ecological and evolutionary studies.</p>
