<p>Angianthus humifusus, commonly known as the dwarf angianthus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat, often growing close to the ground. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
