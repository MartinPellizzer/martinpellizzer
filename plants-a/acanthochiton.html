                    <h1>Acanthochiton</h1>
<p>Acanthochiton, commonly known as the acanthochiton, is a genus of sea snails belonging to the family Acanthochitonidae.</p>
<p>These marine gastropod mollusks are characterized by their heavy, calcareous shells that are often covered in spines or tubercles. They are typically found in shallow marine environments, such as rocky shores and tide pools, where they cling to surfaces using a muscular foot. The shells of Acanthochiton species can vary in color and pattern, providing camouflage against their rocky habitats.</p>
<p>These organisms play a role in marine ecosystems as both prey and scavengers, contributing to the ecological balance of their environment.</p>
