<p>Avena sterilis var. minor, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild annual grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in many regions but has also been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
