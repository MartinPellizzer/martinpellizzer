<p>Asyneuma compactum var. eriocarpum, commonly known as the velvetleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and hairy, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape and have a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
