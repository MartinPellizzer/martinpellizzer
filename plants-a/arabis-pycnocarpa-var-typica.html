                    <h1>Arabis pycnocarpa var. typica</h1>
<p>Arabis pycnocarpa var. typica, commonly known as the dense-fruited rockcress, is a perennial herb native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round, green fruits that mature to a dark red or black. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in crevices or on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
