                    <h1>Athyrium tripinnatum</h1>
<p>Athyrium tripinnatum, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is native to eastern Asia. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
