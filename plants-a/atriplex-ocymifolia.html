                    <h1>Atriplex ocymifolia</h1>
<p>Atriplex ocymifolia, commonly known as silver leaf shadscale, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to saline soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing soils in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Atriplex ocymifolia is also used in traditional medicine by some Native American tribes for its purported health benefits.</p>
