<p>Adiantopsis alata, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate and graceful fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are covered in a layer of tiny, specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Adiantopsis alata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
