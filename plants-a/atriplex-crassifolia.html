<p>Atriplex crassifolia, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in saline and alkaline soils. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Atriplex crassifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
