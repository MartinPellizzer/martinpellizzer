                <h1>Adenostylis emarginata</h1>
<p>Adenostylis emarginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sea hare, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of grasses. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>Adenostylis emarginata plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostylis emarginata has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, brownish bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale blue petals, blooming in spring, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostylis emarginata is primarily native to the western coast of North America, specifically from southern British Columbia through California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and maritime chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. It is often associated with areas that experience frequent wind and salt spray.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the temperate climate and unique ecological conditions of the Pacific coast.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostylis emarginata was mainly introduced to coastal areas of New Zealand, where it has since become naturalized.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the shores of the North and South Islands. This plant is often associated with disturbed or degraded coastal habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora in these sensitive ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is considered a weed in some regions, particularly where it invades dune systems.</p>
