<p>Agrostis subrepens, commonly known as mat grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Agrostis subrepens is also a common component of lawns and meadows, contributing to biodiversity in these habitats.</p>
