                    <h1>Athyrium myriomerum</h1>
<p>Athyrium myriomerum, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
