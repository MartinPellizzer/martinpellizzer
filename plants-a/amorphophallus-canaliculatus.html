                    <h1>Amorphophallus canaliculatus</h1>
<p>Amorphophallus canaliculatus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a floating canopy on the water's surface. The plant's flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a strong, unpleasant odor that attracts pollinators like flies. Its rhizome system allows it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it can become invasive in non-native regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
