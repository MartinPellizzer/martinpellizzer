                <h1>Achilleanthus schmutzii</h1>
<p>Achilleanthus schmutzii, commonly known as the Schmutzii achillea, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features showy yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of smaller florets. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure includes narrow, linear leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achilleanthus schmutzii has simple, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slightly fibrous texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achilleanthus schmutzii is primarily native to the Lesser Sunda Islands.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical regions of Indonesia, specifically within the archipelago of the Lesser Sunda Islands. It thrives in humid and warm climates, often growing in forested areas or near coastal regions. The plant is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of this region, including high rainfall and rich soil.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific islands, making it a regionally endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achilleanthus schmutzii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread rapidly in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
