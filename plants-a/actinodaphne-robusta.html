<p>Actinodaphne robusta, commonly known as the robust daphne, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, cinnamon, and avocado. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and fragrant, small white flowers that appear in clusters. Its fruit is a woody drupe containing a single seed.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne robusta is often valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne robusta has elliptical or ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a leathery texture and a smooth margin; they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and cylindrical, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a tendency to branch out. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in spikes, featuring yellowish-green petals and a single pistil, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns from green to red when mature, dispersing by birds that eat the flesh and excrete the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne robusta is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of eastern India and the Andaman Islands, though it remains most commonly associated with its native range. It thrives in humid, lowland rainforests and is often found in secondary growth areas. The species typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status is currently listed as least concern, but it faces threats from deforestation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne robusta is a tropical evergreen tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid climates with indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree are recommended. Common pests include scale insects and mealybugs, while diseases like root rot can occur if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving ferns or orchids can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne robusta is a valuable plant species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds, contributing to the health of the local ecosystem. The plant also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other flora in the understory of tropical forests.
