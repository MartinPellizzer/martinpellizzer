                <h1>Actinodaphne robusta</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne robusta, commonly known as the robust daphne, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland forests and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its fruits are small, round drupes that contain a single seed, and the tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne robusta plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne robusta has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 10â€“15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a slightly fibrous texture. The flowers are small, greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the rainy season; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne robusta is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of the Malay Archipelago. The plant thrives in humid and warm climates, commonly growing in lowland and hill forest areas. It is often seen in secondary growth and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and localized species within Borneo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne robusta was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as India, Indonesia, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its introduction has sometimes led to invasiveness in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections worldwide.</p>
