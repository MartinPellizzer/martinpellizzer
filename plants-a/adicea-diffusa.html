                <h1>Adicea diffusa</h1>
<p>Adicea diffusa, commonly known as the spreading adicea, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a fibrous root system and erect, branched stems that are often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a rough texture.</p>
<p>Adicea diffusa is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and rocky habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea diffusa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green, glossy upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green color, growing upright with a branched pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea diffusa is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly distributed across West and Central Africa, where it plays a role in local ecosystems. It is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, though its primary range remains in Africa.</p>
<p>Adicea diffusa is known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies by local communities.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea diffusa was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has established itself in regions with warm, moist climates, often thriving in disturbed soils. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds and rhizomes contribute to its successful colonization of new areas. It is commonly found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed forest edges.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation in certain ecosystems.</p>
