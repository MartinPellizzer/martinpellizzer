                <h1>Adromischus pachylophus</h1>
<p>Adromischus pachylophus, commonly known as the fat-tailed ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or container planting.</p>
<p>Adromischus pachylophus requires minimal water and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adromischus pachylophus has fleshy, thick, and rounded leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy surface and a bright green color that may turn reddish under full sun.</p>
<p>The stem is short and often buried, with a smooth, pale green to reddish bark that remains relatively inconspicuous. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently in its native arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adromischus pachylophus is primarily native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Eastern Cape Province. This species grows in rocky, well-drained soils. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in quartzitic hills.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adromischus pachylophus was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-draining soils.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and attractive, fleshy leaves. This species is native to South Africa but has been introduced to various regions, including parts of the United States and Australia. It prefers full sun to partial shade and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
