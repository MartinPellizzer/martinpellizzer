                <h1>Actinella richardsonii</h1>
<p>Actinella richardsonii, commonly known as the Richardson's actinella, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky slopes. It has finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Actinella richardsonii is often found in association with other alpine flora and is adapted to cold, high-elevation climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella richardsonii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth surface, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, relying on wind pollination for reproduction. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella richardsonii is primarily native to the western United States, specifically in the mountainous regions of Washington, Oregon, and northern California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in cool, humid climates and is often associated with coniferous forests. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella richardsonii was mainly introduced to areas with moist, temperate climates, particularly in regions with rich, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments, making it common in forest understories and along stream banks. The plant is often found in the Pacific Northwest of North America, where it has been established in both natural and disturbed habitats. Its introduction has been associated with horticultural trade and accidental dispersal through seed transport.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems remains largely unstudied.</p>
