                <h1>Achillea millefolium var. litoralis</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. litoralis, commonly known as sea yarrow, is a coastal variant of the common yarrow.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with feathery, finely divided leaves and flat clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. This variety is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its growth habit is low and spreading, making it suitable for erosion control in coastal environments.</p>
<p>The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, typical of its coastal habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. litoralis has narrow, linear leaves that are finely divided and arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-gray color due to dense pubescence.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a greenish-gray bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, allowing wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it thrive in coastal or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. litoralis is a coastal variant of yarrow that is native to the western coasts of North America, including regions in California, Oregon, and Washington.</p>
<p>It is now found along rocky shorelines and sandy beaches from British Columbia to California. This plant thrives in saline and wind-exposed environments, often growing in tidal zones and near the water's edge. It typically occurs at low to moderate altitudes, usually below 300 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of concern in some areas, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. litoralis is a coastal variant of yarrow known for its hardy, drought-tolerant nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing established clumps, with division being most effective in early spring or fall. This plant has a perennial growth cycle, thriving in full sun and requiring well-drained soil, though it can tolerate a range of soil types. Minimal fertilization is needed, and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its compact shape.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions, and it pairs well with other drought-tolerant plants like lavender or sedum in coastal gardens.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. litoralis is a coastal plant that provides food and shelter for various insects and small wildlife.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its bright yellow flowers. It acts as a companion plant in coastal ecosystems, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its presence also enhances biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the habitat by improving soil structure and reducing erosion along shorelines.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. litoralis is a coastal variant of yarrow known for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it has been historically used in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. In industrial contexts, it contributes to biodiversity and ecological balance in coastal ecosystems. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and healing, often found in herbal remedies and folklore.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting local wildlife also highlights its ecological importance in maritime environments.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. litoralis has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Aurea' with its bright golden foliage and 'Silver King' known for its silvery-gray leaves.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other Achillea species to create varieties that offer extended blooming periods and enhanced disease resistance. These hybrids often exhibit improved hardiness and a wider range of color variations. Horticulturally, this variety is valued for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and its low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Its use in rock gardens and coastal landscapes highlights its adaptability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
