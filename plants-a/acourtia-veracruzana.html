                <h1>Acourtia veracruzana</h1>
<p>Acourtia veracruzana, commonly known as the Veracruz acourtia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green or white ray florets, and it produces small, hard fruits.</p>
<p>Acourtia veracruzana is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia veracruzana has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, grayish bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's native arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia veracruzana is primarily native to southern Mexico, particularly in the states of Veracruz and Oaxaca.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. This species thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, often in the understory of evergreen forests. It is also occasionally found in parts of Central America, including Guatemala and Honduras.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia veracruzana was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with mild winters and well-drained soils, such as California and Texas. The plant has been reported in both cultivated gardens and naturalized areas, often thriving in disturbed soils. Its introduction has raised concerns among native plant conservationists due to its potential to outcompete local flora.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, its spread requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
