                <h1>Adenophora tatewakiana</h1>
<p>Adenophora tatewakiana, commonly known as the Japanese bellflower, is a perennial herb native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forests and stream sides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adenophora tatewakiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora tatewakiana has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a bushy pattern. Its flowers are bell-shaped, with five lobes, and are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that contains small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, helping it thrive in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora tatewakiana is a rare flowering plant native to the Korean Peninsula, specifically found in the mountainous regions of South Korea.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations, primarily in the southern part of the country. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky slopes and forest understories. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Adenophora tatewakiana is listed as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenophora tatewakiana is a flowering plant known for its delicate blue-violet flowers and upright growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of established clumps, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. This perennial plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by slugs and powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
