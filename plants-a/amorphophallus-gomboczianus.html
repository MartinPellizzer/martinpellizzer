                    <h1>Amorphophallus gomboczianus</h1>
<p>Amorphophallus gomboczianus, commonly known as the Hungarian giant hogweed, is a striking plant native to the Carpathian region of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped leaves and towering, spiky inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces white flowers arranged in a complex, branched structure, typical of the Araliaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an aggressive colonizer in its native habitat.</p>
<p>However, due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
