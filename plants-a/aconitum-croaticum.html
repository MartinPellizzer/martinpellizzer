                <h1>Aconitum croaticum</h1>
<p>Aconitum croaticum, commonly known as Croatian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple spurred flowers. The plant features palmate leaves with deep lobes and produces toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum croaticum has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring up to 15 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and unbranched, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, arranged in a raceme, and have five petals with a spurred structure; they bloom in late summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum croaticum is primarily native to the Balkan Peninsula, including parts of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Albania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions and alpine meadows, often growing in moist, calcareous soils. This species thrives in temperate climates and is typically associated with forest edges and rocky habitats. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking purple or blue flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and endemic plant in certain areas of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum croaticum was mainly introduced to specific regions of Europe, particularly in the Balkans, as a decorative ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It was popularized for its striking blue or purple flowers and its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native flora. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to control its spread and mitigate its impact on natural habitats.</p>
