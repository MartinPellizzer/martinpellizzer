                <h1>Acriopsis gracilis</h1>
<p>Acriopsis gracilis, commonly known as the slender cowparsley, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Acriopsis gracilis is often mistaken for other similar species due to its delicate appearance and growth habits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acriopsis gracilis has slender, upright stems that are usually green or slightly hairy, with a branching growth pattern.</p>
<p>Its leaves are narrow, linear, and alternate along the stem, typically measuring up to 5 cm in length and displaying a pale green color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis gracilis is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils in lowland and montane forest areas. Acriopsis gracilis plays a role in the local ecosystem as both a food source and habitat provider.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the western and eastern regions of Borneo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis gracilis was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open habitats. This plant is often associated with areas that have been impacted by human activity. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>However, its spread remains limited compared to other invasive plants in the region.</p>
