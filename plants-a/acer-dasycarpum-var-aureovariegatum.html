                <h1>Acer dasycarpum var. aureovariegatum</h1>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. aureovariegatum, commonly known as the golden variegated maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking foliage, featuring a mix of green, yellow, and white variegation on its leaves. The tree produces small, red samaras that are distinctive in appearance. It typically grows to a moderate height and has a rounded, spreading canopy.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is valued for its vibrant seasonal color changes and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. aureovariegatum has palmately compound leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a bright yellow-green variegation pattern, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 10 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, with a simple structure and wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to their light weight and aerodynamic shape.</p>
<p>The root system is shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. aureovariegatum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of Europe and North America, often as an ornamental plant. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, typically found in forested areas. This species grows at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation and climate change, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. aureovariegatum is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant yellow variegated leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining variegation. This slow-growing tree thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soil, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead wood.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, and companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. aureovariegatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its showy yellow leaves attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and supporting other plant growth. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by improving air quality and offering aesthetic value to its surroundings.</p>
