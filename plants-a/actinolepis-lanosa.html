                <h1>Actinolepis lanosa</h1>
<p>Actinolepis lanosa, commonly known as the woolly actinolepis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers are often violet or purple in color and attract pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers well-drained conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinolepis lanosa has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they are covered in soft, woolly hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a pale greenish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinolepis lanosa is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and along stream banks. This species is adapted to the warm, humid climate of the region and is often associated with sandy or loamy substrates. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in some parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinolepis lanosa was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, roadsides, and abandoned fields. This plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in regions where it has become established.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
