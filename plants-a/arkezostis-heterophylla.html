                    <h1>Arkezostis heterophylla</h1>
<p>Arkezostis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a wide range of morphological variation in its leaf-like structures.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate and subtropical regions. The thallus is usually pale to dark green, with a dense, leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. Its ability to thrive in diverse environments makes it a common indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphological plasticity is a key feature of its survival strategy in fluctuating habitats.</p>
