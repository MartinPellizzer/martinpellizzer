                    <h1>Athyrium subfluviale</h1>
<p>Athyrium subfluviale, commonly known as the river fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
