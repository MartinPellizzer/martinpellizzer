                <h1>Aclisia secundiflora</h1>
<p>Aclisia secundiflora, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Aclisia secundiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aclisia secundiflora has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aclisia secundiflora is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, as well as in dry, sunny environments. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with coastal scrub and maquis vegetation. It is particularly prevalent in countries such as Spain, Italy, and Morocco.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aclisia secundiflora was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers and compact growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly problematic in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has led to increased management efforts to control its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
