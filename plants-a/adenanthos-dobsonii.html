                <h1>Adenanthos dobsonii</h1>
<p>Adenanthos dobsonii, commonly known as the mountain adenanthos, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and it often forms dense shrubs.</p>
<p>Adenanthos dobsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos dobsonii has leaves that are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a compact, shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, tubular, and pale yellow, arranged in dense spikes, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to nutrient-poor soils and helping the plant retain moisture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos dobsonii is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the Fitzgerald River National Park and the surrounding areas. This plant typically grows in sandy soils within open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. It is well adapted to the local climate, which includes dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Adenanthos dobsonii is an important component of the native flora in this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos dobsonii was mainly introduced to South Australia, where it has established itself in various habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and dune environments, thriving in sandy soils. The plant is known for its striking pink flowers, which appear in spring and attract pollinators. While it is considered a weed in some regions, it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded due to human activity and its adaptability to different environmental conditions.</p>
