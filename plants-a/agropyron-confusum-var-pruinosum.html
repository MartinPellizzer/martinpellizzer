                    <h1>Agropyron confusum var. pruinosum</h1>
<p>Agropyron confusum var. pruinosum, commonly known as the pruinose wheatgrasses, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
