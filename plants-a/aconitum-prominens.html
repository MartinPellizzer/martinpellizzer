                <h1>Aconitum prominens</h1>
<p>Aconitum prominens, commonly known as the tall monkshood, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, hooded blue to purple flowers that are arranged in a raceme, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a distinctive appearance that adds to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Aconitum prominens is known for its toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires caution when handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum prominens has large, compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a smooth, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple spathaceous inflorescences that bloom in late summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storage and anchoring in moist, temperate soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum prominens is primarily native to Tibet.</p>
<p>It grows in the alpine regions of this high-altitude area. This plant is commonly found in meadows and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters. It thrives in the cool and moist climate typical of Tibetan highlands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Tibet due to its particular ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum prominens was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of the European flora during the 19th century.</p>
<p>It was brought intentionally for its ornamental value due to its striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in moist, shaded areas of forest margins and along stream banks. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas of the country.</p>
