                <h1>Achnatherum mesatlasicum</h1>
<p>Achnatherum mesatlasicum, commonly known as the western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Achnatherum mesatlasicum is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum mesatlasicum has narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in length from 5 to 15 centimeters.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green to grayish hue, growing upright and branching sparsely. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and appendage-like structures.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapted to stabilize the plant in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum mesatlasicum is primarily native to Central Asia, including regions such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and parts of China.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly in steppes and grasslands. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It is often part of the vegetation in dry plains and foothills.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum mesatlasicum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high precipitation and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in temperate climates, particularly in the northern hemisphere. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
