                <h1>Acourtia rzedowskii</h1>
<p>Acourtia rzedowskii, commonly known as the Mexican dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features basal leaves that are typically narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in spring, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Acourtia rzedowskii is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia rzedowskii has leaves that are narrowly elliptical, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, slightly hairy bark that is typically reddish-brown in color, and it grows in a sprawling or ascending manner. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming from spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the arid environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia rzedowskii is primarily native to Mexico Central and the Mexico Gulf regions.</p>
<p>This plant is found in specific habitats within these areas, typically in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. It is often associated with arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in regions with low precipitation. The distribution of Acourtia rzedowskii is limited to certain geographic areas within these regions, reflecting its adaptation to local climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in parts of central and southern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia rzedowskii was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, gravel bars, and agricultural fields. This plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often associated with xeric environments. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions where it competes with native flora.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in the ecological landscapes of these areas.</p>
