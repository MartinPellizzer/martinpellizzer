                    <h1>Alyssum dasycarpum var. minus</h1>
<p>Alyssum dasycarpum var. minus, commonly known as the dwarf alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
