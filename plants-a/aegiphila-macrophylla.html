                <h1>Aegiphila macrophylla</h1>
<p>Aegiphila macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila macrophylla has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
