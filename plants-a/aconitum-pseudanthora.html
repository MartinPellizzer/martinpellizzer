                <h1>Aconitum pseudanthora</h1>
<p>Aconitum pseudanthora, commonly known as the Tibetan aconite, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy flowers. The plant produces blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are palmately divided with a distinctive appearance. Aconitum pseudanthora contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant of both botanical interest and caution.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum pseudanthora has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, typically green with a slightly hairy surface, and can reach up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is tall, upright, and cylindrical, with a smooth, dark green to greyish bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in a spicate inflorescence, and consist of showy, spurred petals; they bloom in late summer, attracting insects for pollination. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum pseudanthora is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine environments, often found in rocky slopes and meadows at high elevations. This species is adapted to cold climates and is commonly associated with arid and semi-arid habitats. Its natural range extends into parts of Siberia and the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not commonly found outside of these geographic regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum pseudanthora was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas like forests and along streambanks. This plant has been reported in several regions across Europe, including France, Italy, and Switzerland. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential invasiveness and toxic properties.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains localized and not yet widespread in natural ecosystems.</p>
