                <h1>Acrostichum acutum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum acutum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum acutum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum acutum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are elongated, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is thick and woody with a rough, fibrous bark. The plant produces inconspicuous, spadix-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow, blooming in the summer and relying on wind pollination.</p>
<p>Its fruits are small, three-lobed berries that disperse via animals, and the roots are fibrous and form a dense network to anchor the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum acutum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove forests, and along riverbanks where there is high humidity and saline soil. This plant thrives in brackish or freshwater environments and is often associated with wetland habitats. It is also present in parts of the Caribbean and the Florida Keys in the United States.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends from Mexico through the Caribbean islands to northern South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum acutum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and wetlands in the southern United States, particularly in Florida and the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, making it a common sight in estuaries and mangrove swamps. This plant is often found growing along the edges of tidal flats and in marshes where it can tolerate fluctuating water levels. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions where it competes with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, altering local ecosystems.</p>
