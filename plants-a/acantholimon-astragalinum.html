                        <h1>Acantholimon astragalinum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon astragalinum, commonly known as the Astragalus thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and spiny stems. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is considered a valuable species for ecological studies and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon astragalinum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and their closest algal relatives, characterized by the presence of a complex life cycle involving alternation of generations. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and often possessing spore-producing structures. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many of the earliest diverging lineages of angiosperms, characterized by their primitive floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes many succulent and halophytic species, often with specialized adaptations to arid or saline environments. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly known as the leadplant family, characterized by their often blue or purple flowers and medicinal properties. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid regions, characterized by their succulent stems and small, often clustered flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon astragalinum, a specific plant within the genus Acantholimon, known for its adaptations to harsh environments and its presence in specific geographic regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon astragalinum is primarily native to Iraq.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. It is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of the region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Iraq where the environmental conditions are suitable for its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon astragalinum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in dry, open habitats such as coastal dunes, rocky slopes, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and is typically found in temperate climates. This plant is commonly associated with maritime environments and can tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for coastal restoration projects. It is often used in ecological landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>However, its introduction can sometimes lead to competition with native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
