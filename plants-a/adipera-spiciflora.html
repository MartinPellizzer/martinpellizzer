                <h1>Adipera spiciflora</h1>
<p>Adipera spiciflora, commonly known as the spikeflower mallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its sparsely branched stems and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Adipera spiciflora is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adipera spiciflora has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing in a single, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikelike inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipera spiciflora is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, South Africa, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in grassland and shrubland habitats. This species is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate periods of drought. It is often seen growing in open areas with minimal vegetation cover.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the specific environmental conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipera spiciflora was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun exposure and moderate moisture levels. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly. It has been reported in several regions of Australia and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
