                    <h1>Asclepias conzattii</h1>
<p>Asclepias conzattii, commonly known as the Conzattii milkweed, is a rare and endangered species native to the arid regions of Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking yellow-orange flowers with distinctive, hooded structures called galeae. The plant's milkweed sap contains latex, which is toxic to many animals but serves as a defense mechanism. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is critically important for conservation efforts to protect its dwindling populations.</p>
