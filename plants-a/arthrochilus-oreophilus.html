                    <h1>Arthrochilus oreophilus</h1>
<p>Arthrochilus oreophilus, commonly known as the mountain greenhood, is an orchid species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its terrestrial growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are often hooded, a feature typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, which is essential for its survival in nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
<p>Arthrochilus oreophilus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
