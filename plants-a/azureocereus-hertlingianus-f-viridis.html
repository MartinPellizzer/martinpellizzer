                    <h1>Azureocereus hertlingianus f. viridis</h1>
<p>Azureocereus hertlingianus f. viridis, commonly known as the green cactus or green hedgehog cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, globular shape, often covered in a waxy, greenish coating. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically nocturnal in bloom. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in dry environments.</p>
