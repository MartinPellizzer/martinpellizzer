                    <h1>Acinos vulgaris</h1>
<p>Acinos vulgaris, commonly known as the common acinos, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage with small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its often harsh alpine habitat. It is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a common sight in high-altitude meadows.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest.</p>
