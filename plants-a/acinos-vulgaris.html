                <h1>Acinos vulgaris</h1>
<p>Acinos vulgaris, commonly known as the common acinos, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage with small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its often harsh alpine habitat. It is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a common sight in high-altitude meadows.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos vulgaris has small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems, and measure about 1 to 2 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often branching, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are simple, five-petaled, and white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds through mechanical means when the capsules dry and split open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos vulgaris is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in countries such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of Italy.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, often growing in areas with poor soil conditions. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is well adapted to the harsh environments of the Pyrenees and the Iberian Peninsula. It is also present in some parts of North Africa, including Morocco and Algeria.</p>
<p>Acinos vulgaris is a hardy species that plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos vulgaris was mainly introduced to North America and parts of Europe as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silvery foliage and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to its establishment in wildlands, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation. Despite its aesthetic value, it is considered invasive in some areas where it disrupts local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native plant communities.</p>
