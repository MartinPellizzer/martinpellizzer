                    <h1>Aechmea isabellina</h1>
<p>Aechmea isabellina, commonly known as the pink pineapple plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety coating of trichomes, which help collect and retain moisture. The plant produces a striking pink or red flower spike that emerges from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aechmea isabellina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid environments.</p>
