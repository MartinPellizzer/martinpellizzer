                    <h1>Atriplex cryptocarpa</h1>
<p>Atriplex cryptocarpa, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, a key adaptation to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its seeds are encased in a hard, salt-tolerant coating, allowing it to thrive in saline soils.</p>
<p>Atriplex cryptocarpa plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
