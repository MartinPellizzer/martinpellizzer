                        <h1>Achasma philippinense</h1>
<p>Achasma philippinense, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which are typically borne on slender, branched inflorescences. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually elongated and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid tropical environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
