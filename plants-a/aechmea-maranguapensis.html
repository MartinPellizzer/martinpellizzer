                <h1>Aechmea maranguapensis</h1>
<p>Aechmea maranguapensis, commonly known as the Maranguape bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure that forms a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant features vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to purple, adding to its ornamental value. Its leaves are typically broad and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and provide some protection against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Aechmea maranguapensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rock surfaces in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea maranguapensis has rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow, strap-like, and arranged in a compact circle, with a bluish-green color and a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, and its basal rosette is covered in a dense, fibrous layer of leaf bases that resembles bark. It produces inflorescences with showy, spadix-like flower clusters that are typically pink or red, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>
