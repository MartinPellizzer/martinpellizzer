<p>Aristida fasciculata var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous short, bristly spikelets, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects in dry regions.</p>
