<p>Allocarya hispidula, commonly known as the hairy leaf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its common name.</p>
<p>Allocarya hispidula is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the capture of prey for survival.</p>
