<p>Acrostichum ornatum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its leaves are typically a bright yellow-green, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Acrostichum ornatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>

The fruit is a cluster of tiny, dry berries that disperse through wind and animals.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and spread widely underground, helping to stabilize the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ornatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and along the shores of tropical islands. This plant is well adapted to saline and brackish water conditions, making it a common species in estuarine and tidal areas. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to parts of the Pacific Islands as well, where it contributes to the local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ornatum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the United States, particularly in Florida and the southern coastal areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its attractive, fern-like foliage. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range due to human activity and climate conditions.</p>
