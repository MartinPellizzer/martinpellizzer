<p>Andropogon pachyneuros, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, bluish-green leaves and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for prairie and woodland habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and establish dense stands.</p>
<p>Andropogon pachyneuros plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife.</p>
