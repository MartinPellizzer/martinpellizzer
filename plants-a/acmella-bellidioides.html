                <h1>Acmella bellidioides</h1>
<p>Acmella bellidioides, commonly known as the horned violets, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while the flowers bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Acmella bellidioides is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella bellidioides has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, with a growth pattern that is mostly upright and branching. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in inflorescences, with a short blooming period during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella bellidioides is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is now found in various regions of the Neotropics, including parts of Central and South America. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and humid woodlands. It typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella bellidioides is a tropical flowering plant known for its vibrant, spiky blooms and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Acmella bellidioides includes a dormant phase during winter, followed by active growth and flowering in warmer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmella bellidioides is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which feed on its seeds. The plant acts as a companion plant in agricultural settings, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
