                <h1>Acmella bellidioides</h1>
<p>Acmella bellidioides, commonly known as the false poinsettia, is a species of flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, bract-like leaves that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often hidden beneath the colorful foliage.</p>
<p>Acmella bellidioides is cultivated for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella bellidioides has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, and has a light brown bark that becomes rough with age. The flowers are small, yellow, and borne in clusters, with a short blooming period during the dry season, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella bellidioides is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Argentina Northwest, Bolivia, Brazil South, Brazil Southeast, Brazil West-Central, Paraguay, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and wetlands. The species is well adapted to the regional climate and soil conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella bellidioides was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant yellow flowers and compact growth habit. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and wetland environments, making it difficult to control once established.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among land managers and conservationists.</p>
