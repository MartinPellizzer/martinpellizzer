                <h1>Acrostichum nitidum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum nitidum, commonly known as the glossy fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that can form dense mats. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate-shaped pinnae that are closely spaced.</p>
<p>Acrostichum nitidum is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum nitidum has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that has a fibrous texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically white or pale green, which bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark brown, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in wet, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum nitidum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and tidal flats. This plant is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. It prefers brackish water conditions and is often associated with estuaries and saltwater marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other tropical and subtropical regions around the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum nitidum was mainly introduced to coastal and brackish water areas in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in marshes, mangrove swamps, and along the edges of saltwater ponds. This plant thrives in high-salinity environments and is often used for erosion control due to its dense root system. It has also been introduced to other tropical and subtropical regions for similar ecological purposes.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to saline conditions makes it an important species in coastal restoration projects.</p>
