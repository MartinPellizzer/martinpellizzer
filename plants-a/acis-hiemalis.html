                <h1>Acis hiemalis</h1>
<p>Acis hiemalis, commonly known as the winter acis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in early spring. Acis hiemalis thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting early-season pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acis hiemalis has small, basal leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that grows directly from the base of the plant. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring white petals with a yellow center, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis hiemalis is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. This plant is commonly found in coastal and mountainous regions with cool, temperate climates. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with coniferous forests.</p>
<p>Acis hiemalis is an important component of the local flora, contributing to biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis hiemalis was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has become a potential invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native flora. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to monitor and manage its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
