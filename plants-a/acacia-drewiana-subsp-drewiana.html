<p>Acacia drewiana subsp.</p>
<p>drewiana, commonly known as the African silver acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and its distinctive, feathery foliage composed of small, opposite leaflets.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a hardy species suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
