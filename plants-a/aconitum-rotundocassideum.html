<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, palmately lobed leaves that are rounded at the base. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a spire-like inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
