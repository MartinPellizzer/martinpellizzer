                <h1>Adenophora taiwaniana</h1>
<p>Adenophora taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan bellflower, is a perennial herb native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are opposite, lanceolate, and often hairy, while its stems are erect and branched.</p>
<p>Adenophora taiwaniana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora taiwaniana has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green color on the upper surface, while the underside is lighter green; they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and range in color from white to pale blue, blooming in summer and attracting insect pollinators such as bees. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in forest understory environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora taiwaniana is primarily native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the island, particularly in the central and eastern areas. This plant thrives in cool, humid climates and is often associated with forests and rocky slopes. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is known for its bell-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a regional endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora taiwaniana was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in gardens and botanical gardens due to its ornamental value. The plant prefers partial shade to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It has been reported in several countries, including the United States and parts of Europe, as an ornamental species.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains under study in some regions.</p>
