                <h1>Aciphylla anomala</h1>
<p>Aciphylla anomala, commonly known as the mountain pincushion, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage that resembles a pincushion. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, typically from December to February. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is an important species in the ecological diversity of New Zealand's highland areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla anomala has narrow, linear leaves that are usually clustered at the base, with a silvery-blue color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that grows from the ground upward in a rosette form. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white or pale blue petals, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the rocky soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla anomala is primarily native to New Zealand South.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the South Island, particularly in the Southern Alps. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often seen growing on rocky slopes and gravelly soils. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of the region, including strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Aciphylla anomala plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of New Zealand's alpine ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla anomala was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas, particularly in the South Island. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in coastal and inland dunes.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its specific habitat requirements.</p>
