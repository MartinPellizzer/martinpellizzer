                    <h1>Anisophyllum inaequilaterum</h1>
<p>Anisophyllum inaequilaterum, commonly known as the unequal-sided fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have varying lengths and widths along their margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this fern make it an interesting subject for studying fern morphology and adaptation to humid habitats.</p>
