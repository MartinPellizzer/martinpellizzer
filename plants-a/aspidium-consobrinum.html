<p>Aspidium consobrinum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium consobrinum plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
