<p>Arenaria hirsuta, commonly known as hairy sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically features small, rounded leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Arenaria hirsuta is adapted to cold climates and is considered an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
