                <h1>Adiantum pedatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum pedatum, commonly known as the miter fern, is a delicate, shade-loving fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It features a unique, upright frond structure with fern-like leaves that are finely divided and feather-shaped. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum pedatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shady garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum pedatum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with lanceolate to elliptic leaflets arranged in a delicate, feathery pattern.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright green, with a smooth texture and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant has a slender, wiry stem that is usually light green to brown in color, with a fibrous and slightly hairy texture. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a globose capsule that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pedatum is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands, stream banks, and rocky areas. This fern thrives in regions with cool, humid climates and well-drained soil. It is particularly common in the Appalachian region and the eastern United States.</p>
<p>Adiantum pedatum is often found in areas with limestone or calcareous soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pedatum was mainly introduced to wetlands, stream banks, and shaded forest floors where it thrives in moist, humus-rich soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and partial to full shade. This fern prefers cool to temperate climates and is often used in landscaping for its delicate, lace-like fronds. It spreads through rhizomes and can form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Adiantum pedatum is an ornamental plant that is sometimes cultivated in gardens due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
