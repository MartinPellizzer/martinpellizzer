                    <h1>Adiantum pedatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum pedatum, commonly known as the miter fern, is a delicate, shade-loving fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It features a unique, upright frond structure with fern-like leaves that are finely divided and feather-shaped. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum pedatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shady garden settings.</p>
