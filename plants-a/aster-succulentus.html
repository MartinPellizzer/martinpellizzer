<p>Aster succulentus, commonly known as the stonecrop aster, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late summer. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens.</p>
<p>Aster succulentus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
