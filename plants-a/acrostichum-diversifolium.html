<p>Acrostichum diversifolium, commonly known as the giant reed or common sawgrass, is a tall, grass-like plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and white or silver on the underside, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form dense stands in marshy areas.</p>
<p>Acrostichum diversifolium plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
