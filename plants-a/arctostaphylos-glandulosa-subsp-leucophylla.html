<p>Arctostaphylos glandulosa subsp.</p>
<p>leucophylla, commonly known as the whiteleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring.</p>
<p>The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub ecosystems.</p>
