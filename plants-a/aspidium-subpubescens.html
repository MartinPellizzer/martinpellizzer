<p>Aspidium subpubescens, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered with fine, short hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>Aspidium subpubescens is native to parts of Asia and is often found in temperate climates with high humidity.</p>
