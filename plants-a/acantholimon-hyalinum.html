                        <h1>Acantholimon hyalinum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon hyalinum, commonly known as the silverleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
