                <h1>Achras cortesiana</h1>
<p>Achras cortesiana, commonly known as the "Cortesian palm," is a striking tropical plant native to southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a large, solitary tree with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves that can reach impressive lengths. The plant produces large, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, red fruits containing numerous seeds. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions make it a notable species in botanical gardens.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has cultural significance in its native region.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras cortesiana has large, palmate leaves that are typically 1 to 2 meters in diameter, with a glossy green color and a smooth, leathery texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant, providing a dense, umbrella-like appearance. The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanging throughout the plant's life. The plant produces large, creamy-white flowers that bloom in the late summer to early autumn, with a complex structure that includes showy bracts and is pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a large, spiky capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras cortesiana is primarily native to the Caribbean region, particularly the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and dry forests. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and can be found in both natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific islands where the environmental conditions are suitable for its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras cortesiana was mainly introduced to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and mangrove ecosystems. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its large, palm-like leaves. It has been introduced to several islands in the region as a decorative species.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
