                <h1>Aconitum gilvum</h1>
<p>Aconitum gilvum, commonly known as the golden aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a vibrant contrast to its dark green foliage. The plant is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and palmately compound leaves with deeply cut lobes. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>However, it is highly toxic, containing potent alkaloids that can be dangerous to both humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum gilvum has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are typically lance-shaped or ovate, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green or sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurs, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapting to absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum gilvum is a species of flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas, primarily found in countries such as India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific regions within this area, where it thrives in moist, temperate environments. This plant typically grows in mountainous regions, often in forested areas or along stream banks. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Aconitum gilvum is considered to be of conservation concern, with its population facing threats from human activities and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum gilvum is a striking perennial known for its vibrant yellow flowers and dramatic foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the rhizomes, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, producing flowers and seeds in its second year before dying back.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, moist soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune dead foliage after flowering to encourage healthy growth. It is susceptible to aphids and leaf spot, so regular inspection and treatment are necessary.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns can enhance its ornamental appeal while providing mutual benefits in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aconitum gilvum is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its vibrant flowers attract a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Aconitum gilvum also plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by offering shelter and food resources to various species.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
