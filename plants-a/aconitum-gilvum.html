                <h1>Aconitum gilvum</h1>
<p>Aconitum gilvum, commonly known as the yellow aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmate leaves with a coarse texture and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle or ingest.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it is appreciated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum gilvum has leaves that are compound, typically with 5 to 9 leaflets, arranged alternately along the stem, and are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurs, blooming in late summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum gilvum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, including countries such as Italy, France, and Spain.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky soils and meadows at high elevations. This species is commonly associated with the Pyrenees, Alps, and Apennines mountain ranges. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or open slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in certain parts of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum gilvum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in gardens and naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the western United States. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. However, it is toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
