<p>Agropyron eglume, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to thrive in dry, nutrient-poor environments. Its seeds are wind-dispersed, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
