                <h1>Achillea sambucina</h1>
<p>Achillea sambucina, commonly known as the sweet everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, fluffy clusters of small yellow or white flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic scent, which contributes to its common name. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a soft, fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Achillea sambucina is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its long-lasting flowers and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sambucina has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged in a rosette pattern and measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-gray bark, growing from the base to a height of about 50 cm. The flower heads are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding brown disk florets, blooming from June to August and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, dispersing by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sambucina is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Italy, Spain, France, and parts of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky, and sunny habitats such as slopes, gravelly soils, and disturbed areas. This plant thrives in Mediterranean climates and is often associated with open landscapes and grasslands. It is also known to grow in regions with a temperate climate, particularly in the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of North Africa, including Morocco and Tunisia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sambucina was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas across the eastern and central regions of the country. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has become invasive in some states, outcompeting native vegetation in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant's ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes contributes to its rapid colonization of new areas.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway in certain regions to control its spread and protect native plant communities.</p>
