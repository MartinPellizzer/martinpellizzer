                    <h1>Anogra ctenophylla</h1>
<p>Anogra ctenophylla, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and ancient species of fern that belongs to the family Osmundaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often pale green or whitish in color. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest undergrowth. Anogra ctenophylla has a unique reproductive structure known as a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
