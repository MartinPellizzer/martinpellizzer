<p>Abutilon carterae, commonly known as the Carter's Abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon carterae is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly Texas, and extends into parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky, and sandy soils in arid and semi-arid regions. This plant thrives in open habitats such as plains, grasslands, and disturbed areas. It is often seen along roadsides and in desert scrub environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the southwestern regions of North America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon carterae was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils. It is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded over time, leading to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
