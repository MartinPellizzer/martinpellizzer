                <h1>Abutilon carterae</h1>
<p>Abutilon carterae, commonly known as the Carter's abutilon, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, and thrives in wetland and swampy environments. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, lantern-shaped yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. It has a fibrous root system and can grow up to several feet tall, making it a notable wetland plant.</p>
<p>Abutilon carterae is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon carterae has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, and they vary in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The stem is cylindrical with a rough, hairy texture and a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing upright with some branching. The flowers are showy, with five petals, typically yellow or orange in color, blooming from summer to fall, and are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon carterae is a flowering plant native to the southern United States, particularly Texas, and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited, with populations found primarily in Texas and a few isolated regions in northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. This species typically occurs at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Abutilon carterae is considered a species of concern and is listed as endangered or threatened in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon carterae is a flowering plant known for its vibrant, lantern-shaped blooms and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the more reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often flowering within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, and pruning helps maintain shape and encourage more blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abutilon carterae is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its dense foliage acts as shelter for small insects and birds, enhancing local biodiversity. The plant also functions as a companion plant in gardens, helping to deter certain pests and improve soil health. Additionally, its deep root system aids in erosion control by stabilizing soil in sandy or degraded areas.</p>
<p>Overall, Abutilon carterae plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil integrity in arid environments.</p>
