                <h1>Aconitum triste</h1>
<p>Aconitum triste, commonly known as the melancholy monk's hood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color. The plant produces distinctive, helmet-like flowers with a spurred petal at the back, which is a defining feature of the genus Aconitum. Its foliage consists of palmately compound leaves with deeply cut lobes, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>However, all parts of the plant are highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, making it a dangerous species to handle without proper precautions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum triste has large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in clusters, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and survival in various soil conditions.</p>
