<p>Asplenium pseudochristii, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of dark green, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically 10â€“20 cm in diameter. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Asplenium pseudochristii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
