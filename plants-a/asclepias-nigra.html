<p>Asclepias nigra, commonly known as the black milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to black stems and leaves, which are often covered in a fine, woolly coating. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Asclepias nigra is a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for both caterpillars and adult butterflies.</p>
<p>Its latex sap contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores, making it an important component of its ecological niche.</p>
