                <h1>Acalypha pittieri</h1>
<p>Acalypha pittieri, commonly known as the red-hot catwhiskers, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking red bracts that resemble cat whiskers, which are not actual flowers but modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers surrounded by the vibrant bracts. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage.</p>
<p>Acalypha pittieri is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha pittieri has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy green color and a slightly serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-chambered capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha pittieri is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly found in countries such as Costa Rica and Panama.</p>
<p>It currently has a restricted distribution, primarily occurring in moist lowland forests and along stream banks. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, typically found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acalypha pittieri is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha pittieri is a vibrant, ornamental plant known for its colorful foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant thrives in a warm climate with a growth cycle that includes a dormant phase during cooler months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, but it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
