                    <h1>Algernonia riedelii</h1>
<p>Algernonia riedelii, commonly known as the Riedel's starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Algernonia riedelii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
