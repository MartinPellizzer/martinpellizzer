                    <h1>Asplenium lastreoides</h1>
<p>Asplenium lastreoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with densely packed, linear to lanceolate fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's compact growth habit and ability to thrive in rocky soils make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
