<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their vascular systems and often retaining primitive features. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that typically have separate male and female flowers and are often associated with aromatic compounds.</p>
<p>Its order is Malvales, which includes plants with showy flowers and often includes species that produce cotton or other fibrous materials.

<p>This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky soils and is often seen growing along riverbanks and in open woodlands. The species is well adapted to the climate conditions of these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to these specific parts of Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon grandidentatum was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States, particularly in Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in dry to moist soils and is often seen in open habitats. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered environments.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively.</p>
