                    <h1>Agrostis griffithiana</h1>
<p>Agrostis griffithiana, commonly known as Griffith's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
