                <h1>Achillea carpatica</h1>
<p>Achillea carpatica, commonly known as Carpathian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pale pink. The plant features finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are aromatic and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or grassy habitats.</p>
<p>Achillea carpatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea carpatica has compound, feathery leaves that are gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture, and arranged in a basal rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color, growing from the base of the plant. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding a central cluster of tiny disk florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea carpatica is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is currently found in parts of Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine, where it thrives in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky slopes. This species prefers well-drained soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea carpatica is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea carpatica is a hardy perennial plant known for its vibrant yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in the fall. This plant has a summer-growing cycle, blooming from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, though it prefers dry conditions once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in early spring, while pruning is best done after flowering to maintain shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea carpatica is a flowering plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its bright yellow flowers, supporting biodiversity in the ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through shared resources. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological benefits of the environment by improving soil structure and supporting a diverse range of life forms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea carpatica is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and use in landscaping due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.
