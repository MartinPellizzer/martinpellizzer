                <h1>Achillea carpatica</h1>
<p>Achillea carpatica, commonly known as Carpathian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Carpathian region of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a compact, spreading growth habit with dark green, serrated leaves and flat, white to pale yellow flower heads. The plant produces tiny, disk-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Achillea carpatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea carpatica has basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, arranged in a rosette, and range in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are yellow, composed of ray florets surrounding a central disk, and bloom from June to August, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea carpatica is a flowering plant native to the mountains of the Balkan Peninsula, particularly in countries such as Bulgaria, Serbia, and North Macedonia.</p>
<p>It is now found in various regions across Europe, including parts of Italy, Germany, and France, often as a result of human introduction. This species thrives in dry, rocky slopes and meadows, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea carpatica is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although its populations are considered vulnerable due to habitat fragmentation and over-collection.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea carpatica is a hardy perennial plant known for its attractive, flat-topped yellow flowers and fragrant foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing established clumps, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining the plantâ€™s genetic traits. This plant has a cold-hardy growth cycle, typically blooming in late spring to early summer and entering a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods, but it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring can promote healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea carpatica is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat. This plant acts as a companion plant, often growing well alongside other flowering species to enhance garden diversity. Additionally, its dense root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Achillea carpatica also offers ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting a healthy ecosystem.</p>
