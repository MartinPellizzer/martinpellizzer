                    <h1>Acanthopsis ludoviciana</h1>
<p>Acanthopsis ludoviciana, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with deep root systems and a low, spreading growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>It plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
