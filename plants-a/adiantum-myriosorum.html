                <h1>Adiantum myriosorum</h1>
<p>Adiantum myriosorum, commonly known as the royal fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Adiantum myriosorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum myriosorum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 10â€“30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a finely serrated margin. The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a light green to brown bark that remains smooth as the plant grows. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically greenish-yellow in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer and are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a globose capsule that releases tiny, winged seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor and spread in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum myriosorum is primarily native to China North-Central, China South-Central, China Southeast, East Himalaya, Myanmar, Nepal, Taiwan, and Tibet.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in mountainous regions and forested areas across these regions. It thrives in humid, temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant is often associated with rocky outcrops and streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans a wide geographic range within eastern Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum myriosorum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments like forest floors and rocky outcrops. This plant has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can spread rapidly in suitable conditions.</p>
