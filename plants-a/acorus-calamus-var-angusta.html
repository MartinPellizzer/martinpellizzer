                <h1>Acorus calamus var. angusta</h1>
<p>Acorus calamus var. angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf sweet flag, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically 10â€“30 cm long and have a distinct, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered spikes during the summer months. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. angusta has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically 30-60 cm long, arranged in a rosette pattern, and have a dark green color with a slightly wavy margin.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale yellowish-brown bark that has a slightly fibrous texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow inflorescences with male and female flowers on separate spikes, blooming in early summer, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed nutlet that contains one or two seeds, which are dispersed by water and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming dense underground networks that help anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. angusta is a narrow-leaved variety of the sweet flag plant, native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is now distributed across parts of Southeast Asia, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. This plant thrives in wetland environments such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered threatened in some areas, though its conservation status varies by region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. angusta is a versatile aquatic plant known for its narrow, sword-like leaves and adaptability to various water conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of rhizomes or by planting rhizome cuttings in submerged or shallow water. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months, making it ideal for pond and aquarium environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-rich, loamy soil with consistent moisture, requiring regular watering to maintain optimal growth. Fertilization with a balanced aquatic fertilizer during the growing season supports robust development, while pruning dead foliage helps maintain its appearance.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with snails or algae, and it pairs well with other oxygenating plants for a balanced aquatic ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. angusta is a wetland plant that provides food and shelter for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and insects with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a natural filter, helping to improve water quality by absorbing pollutants. Its dense growth also aids in erosion control by stabilizing soil along water edges.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves as a companion plant for other wetland species, promoting biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. angusta is a lesser-known variant of the sweet flag plant, which has a variety of uses and applications.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, its rhizomes have been used in traditional recipes, particularly in Asian cuisines, for their aromatic properties. Medically, it has been used in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory benefits. Industrially, the plant's essential oils have found use in perfumery and as a natural preservative.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain indigenous communities, often associated with purification and spiritual practices.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. angusta has several popular cultivars that are favored for their ornamental value and adaptability, including 'Pineapple' and 'Variegatus'.</p>
<p>These cultivars are known for their narrow, grass-like foliage and unique color variations. Hybrids of A. calamus var. angusta are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and leaf coloration. In horticulture, this variety is valued for its ability to thrive in wet or boggy conditions, making it a popular choice for water gardens and pond edges.</p>
<p>Its versatility and aesthetic appeal contribute to its significance in both landscape design and ecological restoration projects.</p>
