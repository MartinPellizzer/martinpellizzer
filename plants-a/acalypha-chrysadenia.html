                        <h1>Acalypha chrysadenia</h1>
<p>Acalypha chrysadenia, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by vibrant red or orange leaf-like structures. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Acalypha chrysadenia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its eye-catching foliage and ease of care.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha chrysadenia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also known to grow in coastal areas and near water bodies.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends to parts of the Pacific Islands as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha chrysadenia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several coastal areas, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant is considered invasive in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds dispersed by wind and water. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities and ecosystem balance.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to monitor and manage its spread to prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
