                    <h1>Agropyron pectiniforme var. pseudobulbosum</h1>
<p>Agropyron pectiniforme var. pseudobulbosum, commonly known as the pseudobulbous wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant forms compact pseudobulbs, which are swollen stems that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in harsh environments. It typically blooms with small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in restoration ecology and forage production.</p>
