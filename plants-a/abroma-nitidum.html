                <h1>Abroma nitidum</h1>
<p>Abroma nitidum, commonly known as the smooth abroma, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abroma nitidum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm long and arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abroma nitidum is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka, due to human introduction. This species thrives in open woodland, grasslands, and disturbed areas, often near water sources. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Abroma nitidum is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, although habitat loss poses a potential threat to its natural range.</p>
