<p>Alseis tichocarpa, commonly known as the Pacific yew, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reddish-barked trunk and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its wood is soft and light, historically used by indigenous peoples for various purposes.</p>
<p>The Pacific yew is also notable for containing taxol, a compound used in cancer chemotherapy.</p>
