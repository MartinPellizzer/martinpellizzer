                    <h1>Acacia tortilis f. raddiana</h1>
<p>Acacia tortilis f. raddiana, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of thorny branches, which provides shade and shelter for various animals. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of leaves, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces yellow flowers followed by woody pods containing seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind.</p>
<p>The acacia is well adapted to harsh climates and plays an important ecological role in its habitat.</p>
