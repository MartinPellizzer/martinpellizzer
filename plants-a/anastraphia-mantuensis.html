                    <h1>Anastraphia mantuensis</h1>
<p>Anastraphia mantuensis, commonly known as the Mantuensis ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and intricate, pale pink floral structure that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Anastraphia mantuensis is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
