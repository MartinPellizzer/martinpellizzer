<p>Asparagus umbellatus subsp.</p>
<p>lowei, commonly known as the Low's asparagus, is a rare and striking member of the Asparagaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in arid and rocky habitats in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its subshrub form features woody stems and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
