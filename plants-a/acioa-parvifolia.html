                <h1>Acioa parvifolia</h1>
<p>Acioa parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved acioa, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a leathery texture and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Acioa parvifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acioa parvifolia has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a sprawling or upright manner depending on environmental conditions. Its small, white flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in sandy or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa parvifolia is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically the coastal areas of Georgia and Florida.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. This plant is commonly found in dune ecosystems and maritime hammocks. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa parvifolia was mainly introduced to new habitats in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activities such as trade or accidental transport of plant materials. This distribution suggests that it has adapted well to tropical and subtropical climates. The plant's introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its presence in these regions highlights the need for further ecological studies.</p>
