<p>Alopecurus myosuroides var. minor, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed soils.</p>
