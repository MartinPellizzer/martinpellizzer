                    <h1>Aegilops ventricosa subvar. truncata</h1>
<p>Aegilops ventricosa subvar. truncata, commonly known as the truncate spike wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, often bracted spikelets and reduced glumes. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its morphology is similar to that of wheat, with a distinctive seed head that is shorter and more rounded.</p>
<p>It is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
