<p>Acer thomsonii subsp.</p>
<p>catalpifolium, commonly known as the Catalpa-leaf maple, is a rare and unique maple species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which resemble those of catalpa trees, featuring large, heart-shaped lobes with a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruits are samaras, which are winged seeds that disperse by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
