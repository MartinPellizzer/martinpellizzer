                <h1>Acrostichum micans</h1>
<p>Acrostichum micans, commonly known as the silver fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a silvery underside. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, compact structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>The silver fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum micans has broad, lanceolate leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a clumping manner. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom during the summer months, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum micans is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with wetland habitats. It is also present in some parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Its native range extends from southern Mexico through to northern Argentina.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum micans was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and poor soil conditions, making it a popular choice for landscaping in coastal and marshy regions. The plant's rapid growth and spreading habit have led to its establishment in several non-native habitats. Due to its invasive potential, it is often managed as a weed in wetland restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its distribution highlights the ecological impact of introducing non-native species to new environments.</p>
