                    <h1>Agave havardiana</h1>
<p>Agave havardiana, commonly known as the Blue Agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-gray leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, white flowers, which are typically pollinated by bats and insects. Its rosette-shaped growth habit and ability to thrive in full sun make it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Agave havardiana is also valued for its use in the production of tequila, as its core, or pi√±a, contains the sugars needed for distillation.</p>
