                <h1>Achillea pannonica</h1>
<p>Achillea pannonica, commonly known as Pannonian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry meadows and rocky soils, thriving in full sun. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have also been historically recognized in traditional herbal practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pannonica has leaves that are basal, forming a rosette, with lanceolate to linear shapes, rough and hairy texture, and a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching pattern that becomes more complex as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped umbels, and bloom from June to August, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, enabling the plant to spread and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pannonica is primarily native to Albania, Austria, Belarus, Bulgaria, Central European Russia, Czechia-Slovakia, East European Russia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Krym, NW.</p>
<p>Balkan Pen., Poland, Romania, South European Russia, Türkey, Türkey-in-Europe, and Ukraine. This plant is commonly found in grasslands, meadows, and open areas across these regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with disturbed or semi-natural habitats. Its distribution spans a wide geographic range across Europe and parts of Russia.</p>
<p>The species is well-adapted to the diverse ecological conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pannonica was mainly introduced to Québec as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions of the province, particularly in urban and suburban areas where it is cultivated in gardens and landscaped settings. Despite its ornamental value, it has the potential to spread beyond cultivated areas and establish itself in natural habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its invasive tendencies in certain environments.</p>
<p>Monitoring its distribution and impact is essential to manage its potential ecological effects in Québec.</p>
