<p>Aethionema cardiophylloides, commonly known as the heart-leaved rock白菜, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological resilience, it is increasingly cultivated in drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
