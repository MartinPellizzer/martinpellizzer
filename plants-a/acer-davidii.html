                <h1>Acer davidii</h1>
<p>Acer davidii, commonly known as the David's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras with two distinct wings. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its striking autumn foliage.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acer davidii belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and their relatives, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Sapindales, a group of flowering plants that includes trees and shrubs, many of which have showy flowers and fruits. Its family is Sapindaceae, commonly known as the soapberry family, which includes trees and shrubs with simple leaves and often fleshy fruits. Its genus is Acer, commonly known as maple, which consists of trees and shrubs characterized by opposite leaves and distinctive samaras.</p>
<p>Its species is Acer davidii, a specific type of maple native to China, known for its ornamental value and unique leaf patterns.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer davidii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a doubly serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 12 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The stem is straight and slender, with a smooth, grey-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, and they are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its mountainous habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer davidii is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to isolated populations in these areas. It thrives in temperate climates with cool, moist conditions, typically found in forested areas. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Acer davidii is considered endangered and is under conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer davidii is a deciduous tree known for its striking ornamental value and relatively easy cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The tree has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 10â€“15 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and regular watering during its establishment phase, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally suffer from aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer davidii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers. Its dense canopy acts as a companion plant, offering shade and habitat in forest ecosystems. The roots of Acer davidii help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and reducing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer davidii is a decorative tree known for its ornamental value, often planted in gardens and parks for its attractive foliage and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal practices, it has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and fever-reducing properties. Industrially, it contributes to the timber industry, though its economic importance is limited compared to more commercially valuable tree species.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in regions of its native habitat, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer davidii has several popular cultivars such as 'Atsumi' and 'Dissectum,' which are prized for their unique foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It also has natural hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the diversity within the genus. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced traits like improved cold hardiness or more vibrant fall colors. Horticulturally, Acer davidii is important for its ability to thrive in a variety of climates and its aesthetic appeal in gardens.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids are widely used in landscaping, making it a valuable addition to ornamental horticulture.</p>
