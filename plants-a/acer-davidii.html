                <h1>Acer davidii</h1>
<p>Acer davidii, commonly known as the David's maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and has a slender, upright growth habit. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces samaras (winged seeds) for dispersal.</p>
<p>Acer davidii is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer davidii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a finely serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 12 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips as the tree matures. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during early spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer davidii is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to these areas, where it grows in humid, temperate forests. It thrives in environments with high rainfall and well-drained soils, typically found in mixed hardwood forests. Acer davidii is commonly found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer davidii is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its striking foliage and slow growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer davidii is relatively slow, with new growth appearing in early spring and foliage turning vibrant colors in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a shaded garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer davidii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers and provides nectar and pollen. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity by creating microhabitats. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer davidii contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil quality and offering habitat for a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer davidii is a rare and ornamental tree known for its striking foliage and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to biodiversity and supports local ecosystems, though it has limited commercial value. Culturally, it is valued in certain regions for its aesthetic appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents resilience and natural beauty, inspiring conservation efforts and botanical appreciation.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer davidii has several popular cultivars such as 'Atrosanguineum', known for its deep crimson foliage, and 'Dissectum', which features finely dissected leaves that turn vibrant red in autumn.</p>
<p>It also has hybrids with other maple species, like Acer x carpinifolium, which combines the ornamental traits of David's maple with those of other maples. These varieties are highly valued in horticulture for their unique leaf patterns and seasonal color changes. Due to their aesthetic appeal, they are widely used in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Acer davidii remains a significant plant in the horticultural world for its beauty and adaptability.</p>
