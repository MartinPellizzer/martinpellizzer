                    <h1>Acetosella campestris</h1>
<p>Acetosella campestris, commonly known as common sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb belonging to the Oxalidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a reddish tinge and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant contains oxalic acid, which gives it a sharp, sour taste and makes it potentially toxic if consumed in large quantities. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Acetosella campestris is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
