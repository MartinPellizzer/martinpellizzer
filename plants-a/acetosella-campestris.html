                <h1>Acetosella campestris</h1>
<p>Acetosella campestris, commonly known as common sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb belonging to the Oxalidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a reddish tinge and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant contains oxalic acid, which gives it a sharp, sour taste and makes it potentially toxic if consumed in large quantities. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Acetosella campestris is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acetosella campestris has small, rounded leaves that are typically oval or heart-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and grows upright, with a light green color and a slightly woody texture as it matures. The flowers are small, clustered in dense umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acetosella campestris is a small flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of the world, including North America, where it has been introduced. This species thrives in open, disturbed environments such as roadsides, fields, and woodland edges. It typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Acetosella campestris is not currently listed as threatened, but its populations can be sensitive to habitat loss and changes in land use.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acetosella campestris is a low-growing plant commonly found in disturbed soils and gardens, known for its small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds sown in early spring or by dividing established plants in the spring or fall. The growth cycle of Acetosella campestris is relatively short, with rapid germination and flowering within a few months under favorable conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization is minimal, and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its compact form.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract slugs or aphids in wet conditions, and it pairs well with other groundcover plants for companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acetosella campestris is a small flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other wildflowers in meadow ecosystems. The plant attracts a range of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, which rely on it for sustenance. Additionally, it plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Acetosella campestris contributes to ecological diversity and supports the health of grassland habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acetosella campestris is a small, low-growing plant commonly found in meadows and grassy areas, known for its edible leaves that can be used in salads or as a garnish.</p>
<p>It has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. While not widely used in industrial applications, it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators in its native habitats. Culturally, it is sometimes associated with rural landscapes and has been used in folklore in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems highlights its importance in maintaining healthy ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acetosella campestris has a limited number of recognized varieties, but it is more commonly found in horticultural collections as cultivars and hybrids.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegata' and 'Albiflora', which are prized for their attractive foliage and flowers. While natural hybrids are rare, gardeners often create hybrid forms by cross-pollinating with related species such as Viola species. These hybrids are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability to garden conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, Acetosella campestris holds horticultural importance as a decorative plant in rock gardens and shaded borders.</p>
