                    <h1>Azorella ovata</h1>
<p>Azorella ovata, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that forms dense, compact cushions of foliage, which help it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs, providing insulation and protection from intense sunlight and cold. Azorella ovata is well adapted to rocky, arid conditions and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
