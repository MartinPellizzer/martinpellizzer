<p>Alsine stellata, commonly known as starweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. The plant has small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>Alsine stellata is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, making it both a weed and a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
