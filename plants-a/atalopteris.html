<p>Atalopteris, commonly known as the lace fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, lacy fronds that are often divided into narrow, feather-like segments. Atalopteris species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. They have a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help in spreading and anchoring the plant.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value.</p>
