                <h1>Achillea cancrini</h1>
<p>Achillea cancrini, commonly known as the Cancer root, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its gray-green foliage and flat-topped clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in coastal areas. It has a long history of use in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea cancrini has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and somewhat woody at the base, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly pubescent. The flowers are small, yellowish-white composite blooms arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal, and the seeds are lightweight and easily carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea cancrini is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in parts of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>Currently, it is also present in some areas of North Africa, though its distribution has become fragmented. This species thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in grasslands and open woodlands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea cancrini is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea cancrini is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and vibrant yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seeds sown in late summer. The growth cycle of Achillea cancrini includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering occurring in the spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and pruning of dead foliage in autumn promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea cancrini is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering both nectar and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its beneficial properties. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Achillea cancrini also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and promoting a healthy ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea cancrini is a flowering plant known for its potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects, which have been explored in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
<p>It is also used in the production of essential oils, contributing to the industrial and economic sectors through aromatic and cosmetic applications. In some regions, it holds cultural significance and is used in symbolic or ritualistic contexts. However, its culinary use is limited due to its strong aroma and bitter taste.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea cancrini plays a role in various applications, though further research is needed to fully understand its potential.</p>
