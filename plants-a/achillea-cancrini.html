                <h1>Achillea cancrini</h1>
<p>Achillea cancrini, commonly known as the Cancerous Yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that are typically pink to purple in color. The plant features finely divided, silver-gray foliage that is aromatic and often used in traditional herbal remedies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Its name is derived from the Latin word "cancer," referring to its supposed medicinal use in treating cancerous conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea cancrini has compound, serrated leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and somewhat woody at the base, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more fibrous with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish-white composite heads composed of numerous tiny florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to the feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish new colonies in suitable habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea cancrini is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Italy, Spain, and Morocco, where it thrives in rocky and coastal environments. This species prefers sunny, well-drained soils and is commonly found in dry grasslands and slopes. It grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Achillea cancrini is listed as a species of conservation concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea cancrini is a hardy perennial plant known for its bright yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between waterings. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in early spring, and pruning is recommended after flowering to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or chives can help deter pests and enhance garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea cancrini is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, which rely on its flowers and seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>It also contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea cancrini is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia, known for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It has been traditionally used in herbal medicine to treat digestive issues and skin conditions due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial compounds. While not widely used in culinary applications, it may be incorporated into local herbal teas or infusions. Industrially, it holds potential for pharmaceutical development due to its bioactive compounds.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may symbolize resilience or healing in certain regions, though its symbolic significance is less documented compared to other members of the Asteraceae family.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea cancrini has several varieties and cultivars that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability to different growing conditions.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' and 'Purpurea', which are known for their striking yellow and purple foliage, respectively. While there are no widely recognized hybrids of Achillea cancrini, crossbreeding with other yarrow species has led to the development of new cultivars with enhanced traits. These plants are important in horticulture for their ability to thrive in poor soils and their long blooming period.</p>
<p>Their use in gardens and landscapes highlights their ecological and aesthetic value.</p>
