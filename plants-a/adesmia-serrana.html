                <h1>Adesmia serrana</h1>
<p>Adesmia serrana, commonly known as the serrated adesmia, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant typically features small, compound leaves with serrated edges, giving it its common name. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale purple.</p>
<p>Adesmia serrana is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia serrana has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 2 to 6 cm in length, usually with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that exhibits a slightly woody texture as the plant matures. Its small white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in racemes, featuring five petals and a prominent stamen, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia serrana is primarily native to Argentina South.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of Argentina, particularly in the Patagonian area. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in open grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the southern part of the country.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia serrana was mainly introduced to new habitats in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it has established itself in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. This plant is often associated with grazing areas and has been observed in both natural and human-modified landscapes. Its introduction has led to its spread across several states, including Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions and is primarily a native species in its range.</p>
