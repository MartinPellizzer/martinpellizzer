                    <h1>Ananas microcephalus var. robustus</h1>
<p>Ananas microcephalus var. robustus, commonly known as the dwarf pineapple, is a compact, low-growing bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, waxy, sword-shaped leaves that are often green with red or purple margins. The plant produces a small, edible fruit that is less sweet and more acidic than the typical pineapple. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements make it a desirable ornamental plant.</p>
