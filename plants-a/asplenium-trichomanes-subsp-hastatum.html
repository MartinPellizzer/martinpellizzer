<p>Asplenium trichomanes subsp.</p>
<p>hastatum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided, serrated leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. It produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, indoor setting.</p>
