<p>Abies trigona, commonly known as the narrowleaf fir, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that hang downward, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>The narrowleaf fir is valued for its timber and is also an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
