<p>Asperula cynanchica var. supina, commonly known as creeping asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the upper surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its spreading habit.</p>
