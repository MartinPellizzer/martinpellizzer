                    <h1>Asplenium pumilum</h1>
<p>Asplenium pumilum, commonly known as the small spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to various regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, walls, and forest floors. The plant features a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like growth. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium pumilum is well adapted to humid conditions and is often found in association with other epiphytic or lithophytic plants.</p>
