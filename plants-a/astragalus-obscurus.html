<p>Astragalus obscurus, commonly known as the dark milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to reddish-purple pea-like flowers. Its small, hairy pods contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Astragalus obscurus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for native pollinators.</p>
