<p>Asplenium erosum var. erosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spleenwort, is a fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. The plant has lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated margin. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its delicate appearance and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
