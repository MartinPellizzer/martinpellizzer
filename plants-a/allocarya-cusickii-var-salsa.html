                    <h1>Allocarya cusickii var. salsa</h1>
<p>Allocarya cusickii var. salsa, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing disturbed soils in harsh environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration, a key adaptation to its dry habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, and it is often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions makes it an important component of desert and coastal ecosystems.</p>
