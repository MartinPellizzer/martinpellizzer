                    <h1>Arctostaphylos pulchella</h1>
<p>Arctostaphylos pulchella, commonly known as the alpine bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Arctostaphylos pulchella is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in harsh climates.</p>
