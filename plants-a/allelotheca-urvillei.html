                    <h1>Allelotheca urvillei</h1>
<p>Allelotheca urvillei, commonly known as the Urville's thorned scale, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Cactaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and reduced leaves, which are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its reproductive structures are highly modified, with the fruit being a fleshy, red berry containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Allelotheca urvillei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
