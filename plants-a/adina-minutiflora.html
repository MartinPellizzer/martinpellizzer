<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina minutiflora is a small shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has been significantly reduced due to habitat loss, with remaining populations found primarily in protected areas. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil, typically found in lowland and montane forests. Adina minutiflora is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
