                <h1>Adina minutiflora</h1>
<p>Adina minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered adina, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adina minutiflora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina minutiflora has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly hairy, with a light gray bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense spikes, with pale yellow petals and a strong, sweet fragrance, blooming from late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soils and helping the plant thrive in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina minutiflora is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often growing in shaded understory conditions. It is also present in parts of the Indian subcontinent, including India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Adina minutiflora is typically found in association with other native flora in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina minutiflora was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the coastal regions of the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, dunes, and sandy soils. This plant has become naturalized in these areas, often spreading through seed dispersal by wind and water. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its small, fragrant flowers.</p>
