                <h1>Absinthium cernuum</h1>
<p>Absinthium cernuum, commonly known as common wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, aromatic, and covered in a whitish down.</p>
<p>Absinthium cernuum is known for its strong, bitter aroma and has a long history of use in traditional medicine and herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Absinthium cernuum has elongated, narrow leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-gray bark that becomes more woody as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, panicle-like inflorescences, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in moist, disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Absinthium cernuum is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in regions such as Spain, Italy, and parts of France.</p>
<p>It is now also distributed in some areas of North Africa and the Middle East. This species thrives in open, sunny environments like grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, Absinthium cernuum is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, but its populations are considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Absinthium cernuum is a low-growing perennial plant known for its fragrant, feathery foliage and delicate blue flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rootstock in early spring. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in late spring and summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering that can lead to root rot. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its compact shape.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs, and it thrives when planted with companion plants like lavender or thyme.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Absinthium cernuum is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense growth. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by improving soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Absinthium cernuum contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions in its habitat.</p>
