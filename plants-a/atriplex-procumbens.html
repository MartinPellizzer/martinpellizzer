<p>Atriplex procumbens, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Atriplex procumbens is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and other saline or dry habitats.</p>
