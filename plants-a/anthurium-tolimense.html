<p>Anthurium tolimense, commonly known as the Tolima anthurium, is a species native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathes that can range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting green or yellow spathe. The plant produces small, clustered spadices that are typically green or yellow, housing the actual flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
