                    <h1>Agave weberi</h1>
<p>Agave weberi, commonly known as the Weber's agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color and lined with spines. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing small, white flowers. Agave weberi is adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate makes it a long-lived plant, often used in xeriscaping and as a decorative specimen in gardens.</p>
