<p>Atriplex asterocarpa, commonly known as the silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to soils with high salinity.</p>
<p>Atriplex asterocarpa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
