                    <h1>Aleuritopteris × pangteyi</h1>
<p>Aleuritopteris × pangteyi, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a sterile hybrid between Aleuritopteris plicata and Aleuritopteris japonica.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds with a distinctive, finely pinnate structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in humid forests. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures on the underside.</p>
<p>Despite being sterile, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions.</p>
