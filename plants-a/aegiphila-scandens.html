<p>Aegiphila scandens, commonly known as the climbing aegiphila, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twining stems that allow it to climb and spread across other vegetation. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Aegiphila scandens is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along stream banks.</p>

<p>Aegiphila scandens has compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with ovate to elliptic leaflets that are usually glossy green and vary in size from 2 to 5 centimeters.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, light gray bark that grows in a climbing or trailing pattern.
