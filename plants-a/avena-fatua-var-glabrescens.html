<p>Avena fatua var. glabrescens, commonly known as slender oat, is a variant of the common oat species characterized by its reduced hair coverage on the stems and leaves.</p>
<p>This plant is an annual grass that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, and the seeds are enclosed in small, oval husks.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions.</p>
