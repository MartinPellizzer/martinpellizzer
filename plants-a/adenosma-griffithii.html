                <h1>Adenosma griffithii</h1>
<p>Adenosma griffithii, commonly known as the Himalayan bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often at high altitudes. Its leaves are usually opposite and elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Adenosma griffithii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma griffithii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly rough texture and a pale green to reddish-brown color, exhibiting an erect growth pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma griffithii is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, including countries such as India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with moist, tropical, and subtropical climates. This plant typically grows in open woodland, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found at elevations ranging from 300 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Adenosma griffithii is also occasionally reported in parts of Southeast Asia, such as Myanmar and Bangladesh.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma griffithii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity such as land clearing or agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils, making it common in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is typically found in disturbed environments like roadsides, waste areas, and forest edges where it can quickly establish itself. Its introduction has led to its spread in several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native flora.</p>
