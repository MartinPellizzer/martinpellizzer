                        <h1>Abutilon thurberi</h1>
<p>Abutilon thurberi, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fuzzy, maple-like leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Abutilon thurberi is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abutilon thurberi belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many ancient and primitive angiosperms.</p>
<p>Its order is Malvales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants with showy flowers and often hairy leaves. Its family is Malvaceae, commonly known as the mallow family, which includes plants with capsule fruits and often showy flowers. Its genus is Pseudabutilon, a group of flowering plants that are closely related to the genus Abutilon but have distinct morphological features.</p>
<p>Its species is Pseudabutilon thurberi, a specific type of plant within the genus Pseudabutilon, known for its unique characteristics and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon thurberi is primarily native to Arizona, Mexico Northeast, and Mexico Northwest.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in desert and semi-desert regions within these areas. It thrives in arid environments with well-drained soils. Abutilon thurberi is often seen along dry streambeds and in rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the specific ecological conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon thurberi was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-like flowers.</p>
<p>It has since spread into native habitats, becoming invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can establish itself along roadsides, riverbanks, and other open areas. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal contribute to its ability to spread quickly and colonize new sites.</p>
<p>As a result, it is now considered a noxious weed in several regions, requiring management to prevent further spread.</p>
