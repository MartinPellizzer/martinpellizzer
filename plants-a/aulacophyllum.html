                    <h1>Aulacophyllum</h1>
<p>Aulacophyllum, commonly known as the common rockcap, is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Aulacomoniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a simple thalloid structure with leaf-like structures that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. Aulacophyllum species are typically small, with a lack of distinct stems and leaves, and they reproduce through spore capsules that are often clustered in dense groups.</p>
<p>These mosses play an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in their habitats.</p>
