                <h1>Acer nigrum subsp. saccharophorum</h1>
<p>Acer nigrum subsp.</p>
<p>saccharophorum, commonly known as the sugar maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of palmate leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the autumn.</p>
<p>The tree produces samaras, which are winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, developing into a more rugged texture with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer nigrum subsp.</p>
<p>saccharophorum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and it grows as a small tree or shrub.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in catkins, blooming in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two wings, dispersing by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, acidic soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer nigrum subsp.</p>
<p>saccharophorum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces. While its native range was once broader, its current distribution is limited to isolated populations in these areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments such as montane forests and rocky slopes. This species is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is classified as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer nigrum subsp.</p>
<p>saccharophorum is a deciduous shrub known for its ornamental value and adaptability. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The growth cycle involves active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a dormant period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer nigrum subsp.</p>
<p>saccharophorum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, red flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil health. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer nigrum subsp.</p>
<p>saccharophorum is a species of maple native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance. Its sap, while not as commonly used as that of other maples, has been historically employed in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The tree also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Culturally, it is sometimes revered in traditional practices and may hold symbolic significance in regional folklore.</p>
<p>Additionally, its timber has been used in small-scale woodworking and crafts, contributing to local economies in some areas.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer nigrum subsp.</p>
<p>saccharophorum has several notable varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued in horticulture. Popular cultivars include 'Atrosanguineum' and 'Crimson King,' which are known for their striking red foliage.</p>
<p>Hybrids with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, have been developed to enhance ornamental traits like color and growth form. These cultivars and hybrids are prized for their vibrant autumn colors and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>
<p>Overall, they hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and versatility in landscaping.</p>
