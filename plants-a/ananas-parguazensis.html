<p>Ananas parguazensis, commonly known as the Parguazense pineapple, is a rare species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a solitary, fragrant flower that is typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
