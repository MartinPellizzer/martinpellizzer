                    <h1>Agrostis nana</h1>
<p>Agrostis nana, commonly known as dwarf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as those in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in compacted soils and its tolerance to frequent mowing, making it a popular choice for turfgrass.</p>
<p>Agrostis nana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
