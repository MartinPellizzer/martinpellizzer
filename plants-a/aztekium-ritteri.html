                    <h1>Aztekium ritteri</h1>
<p>Aztekium ritteri, commonly known as the Ritter's aztekium, is a small, slow-growing cactus native to the Sierra de San Francisco in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of fine, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. Aztekium ritteri is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
