                <h1>Adiantum erylliae</h1>
<p>Adiantum erylliae, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors. Its leaves are typically bright green with a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Adiantum erylliae is prized in horticulture for its elegant foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum erylliae has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lacey appearance, and they are typically bright green, sometimes with a bluish tinge.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-yellow, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum erylliae is primarily native to Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant is well adapted to the humid climate and rich soil conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It is often seen in mountainous areas where the microclimate supports its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum erylliae was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This plant is often associated with disturbed soils and can thrive in both natural and cultivated environments. Its introduction has led to its presence in several ecological regions across the West Coast.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these areas and is sometimes classified as an invasive plant.</p>
