<p>Acer negundo f. angustissimum, commonly known as the narrowleaf silver maple, is a variant of the silver maple tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often more narrow than those of the typical silver maple. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is appreciated in urban landscapes due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
