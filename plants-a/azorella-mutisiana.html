<p>Azorella mutisiana, commonly known as the Andean haircap, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Azorella mutisiana is well adapted to harsh, arid conditions and is often found in rocky or alpine regions.</p>
