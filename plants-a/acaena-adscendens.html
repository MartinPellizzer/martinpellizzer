<p>Acaena adscendens, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its spiny, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated edge.</p>
<p>Acaena adscendens is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acaena adscendens has compound, alternate leaves that are typically trifoliate or pinnate, with leaflets that are elliptic to ovate in shape, ranging from 1 to 3 cm in length, and are usually bright green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, greyish-brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern with a tendency to branch near the base. The plant produces small, spherical flowers that are yellowish-green in color, arranged in dense clusters, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent achene, containing a single seed, which is dispersed by wind due to its feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the surface layer of the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena adscendens is a shrub native to New Zealand, specifically found in the South Island.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes both natural and cultivated areas, though it is primarily found in its native range. It thrives in temperate environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soils in forest margins or along stream banks. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acaena adscendens is listed as a species of conservation concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acaena adscendens is a flowering plant native to New Zealand, known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. The growth cycle of Acaena adscendens includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions that can lead to root rot. Fertilization during the growing season with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage flowering are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions, and it benefits from companion planting with native grasses or shrubs.</p>
