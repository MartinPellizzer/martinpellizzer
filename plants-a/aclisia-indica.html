<p>Aclisia indica, commonly known as the Indian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Aclisia indica is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aclisia indica has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, with a rough texture and a brownish color, growing upright with some branching. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
