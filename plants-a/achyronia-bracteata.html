                <h1>Achyronia bracteata</h1>
<p>Achyronia bracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Achyronia bracteata is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in some areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia bracteata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light grayish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia bracteata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. This plant thrives in disturbed habitats like secondary forests, open woodlands, and along forest edges. It is also occasionally found in parts of southern China and northern India.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high biodiversity and suitable moisture levels.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia bracteata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it common in roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds contribute to its invasive potential in new regions. It is sometimes considered a weed due to its competitive nature over native plant species.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is also valued for its ornamental flowers and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
