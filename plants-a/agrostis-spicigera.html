                    <h1>Agrostis spicigera</h1>
<p>Agrostis spicigera, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
