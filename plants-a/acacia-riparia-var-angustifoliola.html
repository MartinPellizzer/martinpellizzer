                        <h1>Acacia riparia var. angustifoliola</h1>
<p>Acacia riparia var. angustifoliola, commonly known as the narrow-leaf river acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, often spiny stems and narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow globular flowers, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fodder.</p>
