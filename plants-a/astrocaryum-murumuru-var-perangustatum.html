                    <h1>Astrocaryum murumuru var. perangustatum</h1>
<p>Astrocaryum murumuru var. perangustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf murumuru palm, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and clustered, spiny fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, oily fruits used in traditional medicine and cosmetics. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a source of murumuru butter, a natural ingredient valued for its moisturizing properties.</p>
<p>However, it faces threats from habitat loss and overharvesting, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
