                    <h1>Arenaria viscidula var. hybrida</h1>
<p>Arenaria viscidula var. hybrida, commonly known as the sticky sandwort hybrid, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its stems are often covered in a sticky substance, which may deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This variant is a hybrid, likely resulting from crosses between different species within the Arenaria genus.</p>
