                <h1>Acranthera athroophlebia</h1>
<p>Acranthera athroophlebia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acranthera, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassland habitats and is known for its delicate, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera athroophlebia has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in spring and attracting insect pollinators. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera athroophlebia is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is typically associated with lowland and montane forest regions. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are important to protect its natural distribution and ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera athroophlebia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of ornamental and horticultural plants. The plant is now considered an invasive species in certain regions of the country. It has spread to coastal and disturbed areas, often outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to monitor and control its distribution to prevent further ecological impact.</p>
