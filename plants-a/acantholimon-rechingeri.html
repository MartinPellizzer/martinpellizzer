<p>Acantholimon rechingeri, commonly known as the Rechinger's thornscale, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or violet, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It grows from a short, thickened stem and has a low, spreading habit, making it well adapted to rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
