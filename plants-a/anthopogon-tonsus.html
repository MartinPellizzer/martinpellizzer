                    <h1>Anthopogon tonsus</h1>
<p>Anthopogon tonsus, commonly known as the narrowleaf false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Anthopogon tonsus is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance but lacks the stinging hairs.</p>
