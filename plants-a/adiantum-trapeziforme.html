                <h1>Adiantum trapeziforme</h1>
<p>Adiantum trapeziforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces upright, lance-shaped pinnae with a distinctive trapezoidal shape. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Adiantum trapeziforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum trapeziforme has fern-like leaves that are triangular in shape, with a bright green color and a delicate, feathery texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, with a fairly small size, typically reaching up to 30 cm in length. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a creeping or upright pattern depending on the environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum trapeziforme is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland forests and moist, shaded environments. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often associated with rocky or forested habitats. It is also present in parts of India and Sri Lanka, where it grows in similar ecological conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the warm, wet climates of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum trapeziforme was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was initially brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fern-like foliage. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and has spread rapidly in natural ecosystems. Its introduction has led to competition with native plant species and disruption of local habitats.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
