                    <h1>Agrostis ecklonis</h1>
<p>Agrostis ecklonis, commonly known as coastal grass or beach grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. Agrostis ecklonis is well adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it a common sight in coastal dunes and shorelines.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems.</p>
