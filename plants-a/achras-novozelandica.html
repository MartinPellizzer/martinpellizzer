                <h1>Achras novozelandica</h1>
<p>Achras novozelandica, commonly known as the New Zealand aloe, is a succulent plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, yellow-orange flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are thick and waxy, with a bluish-green color and serrated edges.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras novozelandica has large, palmate leaves that are broad and lobed, typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is short and sturdy, with smooth, greyish bark that remains relatively unbranched. The plant produces large, yellowish-white flowers with a distinct, spiky structure, blooming during the summer months and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant and helping it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras novozelandica is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the region of Marlborough. This plant thrives in coastal and lowland areas with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with dry, sunny habitats such as scrublands and open forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras novozelandica was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique fruit. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native species. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both drought and moderate frost.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
