<p>Aechmea coelestis var. acutifolia, commonly known as the sky blue bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, spiky, dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped inflorescences in shades of blue and purple, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its vibrant appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
