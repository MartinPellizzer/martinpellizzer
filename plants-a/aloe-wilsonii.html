<p>Aloe wilsonii, commonly known as the Wilson's aloe, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Aloe wilsonii is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in xeriscaping.</p>
