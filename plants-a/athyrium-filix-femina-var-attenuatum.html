<p>Athyrium filix-femina var. attenuatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and indoor plant collections.</p>
