                <h1>Achimenes ignea</h1>
<p>Achimenes ignea, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the foliage. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually green with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Achimenes ignea is known for its ability to produce multiple blooms throughout the growing season, making it a popular choice for gardeners and horticulturists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes ignea has heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody at the base, and covered with a smooth, reddish-brown bark. Its flowers are showy, tubular, and bilaterally symmetrical, displaying vibrant red and orange hues, blooming from summer to autumn and primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes ignea is a striking tropical plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Guatemala.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to cultivated gardens and botanical collections due to habitat loss. It thrives in warm, humid environments with well-drained soil, typically found in shaded forest understories. This species grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Achimenes ignea is considered vulnerable due to its restricted habitat and declining wild populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achimenes ignea is a vibrant tropical plant known for its showy, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or by dividing the rhizomes, which should be done in spring for optimal results. This plant has a summer-growing cycle, thriving in warm climates and blooming from late spring to early fall.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture, with watering reduced during the dormant winter months. Regular fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season, along with pruning to encourage bushier growth, helps maintain its health. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like root rot can occur if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
