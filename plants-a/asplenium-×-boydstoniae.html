                    <h1>Asplenium × boydstoniae</h1>
<p>Asplenium × boydstoniae, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, epiphytic fern that typically thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, finely divided fronds with a distinctive dark green color and a glossy texture. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival.</p>
