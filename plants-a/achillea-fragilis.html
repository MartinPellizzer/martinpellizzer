                <h1>Achillea fragilis</h1>
<p>Achillea fragilis, commonly known as brittle yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and small, white to pale yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its fragility in handling makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Achillea fragilis is also valued for its historical use in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea fragilis has leaves that are basal, spoon-shaped (spatulate), and have a silver-gray underside, with a soft, woolly texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and hairy, with a light green color, and grows in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are flat-topped umbels composed of small, white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea fragilis is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Currently, it has a fragmented distribution, with populations scattered across its native range and some introduced areas. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and open woodlands. This species typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Achillea fragilis is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea fragilis is a delicate, herbaceous perennial known for its finely cut, fern-like foliage and airy clusters of white flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth in spring and flowering in mid to late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize with a balanced fertilizer in early spring, and prune back spent flower heads to encourage re-blooming.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs, and it pairs well with lavender, echinacea, and other drought-tolerant plants.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea fragilis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its dense root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Achillea fragilis also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea fragilis is a flowering plant known for its delicate appearance and historical significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. In industrial contexts, it may contribute to ecological balance by supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in natural habitats. Culturally, it has symbolic associations with remembrance and resilience, often found in folklore and historical narratives.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological and ornamental horticulture highlights its value in landscape design and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea fragilis has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' and 'Purpurascens,' which are known for their vibrant yellow and purple foliage, respectively. While there are fewer hybrids specifically bred for Achillea fragilis compared to other yarrow species, some horticultural crosses have been developed to enhance flower color and disease resistance. These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in gardens for their drought tolerance and long-lasting blooms.</p>
<p>Their horticultural importance lies in their ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and their contribution to pollinator habitats.</p>
