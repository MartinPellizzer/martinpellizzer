                <h1>Achillea fragilis</h1>
<p>Achillea fragilis, commonly known as brittle yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its slender stems and fragrant, finely divided leaves are adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers, which range from white to pale yellow, bloom in summer and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea fragilis has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly hairy surface and a pale green color, growing upright and branching towards the top. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind due to its lightweight and hairy structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea fragilis is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean area, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of Italy.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited, with populations found mainly in isolated areas of the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, slopes, and wastelands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes have led to concerns about its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea fragilis is a hardy perennial that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a versatile addition to gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The growth cycle of Achillea fragilis involves a dormant winter period followed by active growth and flowering in early summer.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it requires moderate watering and occasional fertilization during the growing season, along with light pruning to maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea fragilis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, which rely on its seeds and foliage for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea fragilis contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea fragilis is a flowering plant known for its delicate, feathery foliage and small yellow flowers, which have been used historically in various ways.</p>
<p>In medicinal applications, it has been traditionally used to treat skin conditions and as a mild sedative due to its essential oils. While it is not widely used in culinary contexts, some cultures have incorporated it into herbal teas or infusions. Industrially, it may contribute to the production of natural dyes or as a source of aromatic compounds.</p>
<p>Culturally, it has symbolic meanings in some regions, often associated with healing and protection.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea fragilis has several popular cultivars such as 'Aurea' and 'Purpurea', which are valued for their striking foliage and flowers.</p>
<p>It also has hybrids that combine traits from other achillea species, enhancing garden versatility. These varieties are favored in horticulture for their hardiness and ability to thrive in a range of conditions. They are commonly used in rock gardens and borders due to their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea fragilis plays an important role in modern landscaping and floral design.</p>
