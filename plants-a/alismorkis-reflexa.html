<p>Alismorkis reflexa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense spikes and bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Alismorkis reflexa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians.</p>
