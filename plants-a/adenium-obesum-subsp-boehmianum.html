<p>Adenium obesum subsp.</p>
<p>boehmianum, commonly known as the Desert Candle, is a striking succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>

<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular specimen in botanical gardens and among plant enthusiasts.</p>
