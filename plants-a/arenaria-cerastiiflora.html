<p>Arenaria cerastiiflora, commonly known as the sand sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Arenaria cerastiiflora is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or mountainous areas.</p>
