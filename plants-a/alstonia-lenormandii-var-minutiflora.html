                    <h1>Alstonia lenormandii var. minutiflora</h1>
<p>Alstonia lenormandii var. minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf flame tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in summer. Its ornamental value comes from its striking red or orange seed pods that split open to reveal bright red seeds.</p>
<p>This variant is less common than the standard Alstonia lenormandii and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in tropical gardens.</p>
