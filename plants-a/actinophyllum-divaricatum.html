                <h1>Actinophyllum divaricatum</h1>
<p>Actinophyllum divaricatum, commonly known as the variable actinophyllum, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, with opposite, narrow leaves that have a leathery texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests.</p>
<p>The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophyllum divaricatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophyllum divaricatum is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in subtropical and tropical rainforests, as well as in moist, shaded areas of coastal regions. This plant typically grows in rocky or clay soils and is often associated with rainforest understorey vegetation. It is also occasionally found in wetlands and along streamlines in its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some parts of its distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophyllum divaricatum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in dunes and along the edges of freshwater wetlands. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, which has led to its spread beyond its original range. It is often considered an invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature.</p>
<p>However, it also plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
