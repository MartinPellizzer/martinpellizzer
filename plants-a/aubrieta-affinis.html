                    <h1>Aubrieta affinis</h1>
<p>Aubrieta affinis, commonly known as the alpine aubrieta, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse blooms. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that typically appear in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Aubrieta affinis is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
