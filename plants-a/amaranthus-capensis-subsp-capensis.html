<p>Amaranthus capensis subsp.</p>
<p>capensis, commonly known as red amaranth, is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and vibrant red to purple foliage, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, green flowers that develop into three-angled, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
