                            <h1>Agrostis Alba Subsp. Scabriglumis</h1>
<p>Scabrous bentgrass, scientifically known as Agrostis alba subsp. scabriglumis, is a lesser-known member of the grass family that thrives in moist, shaded environments. This subspecies is characterized by its rough, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in challenging conditions. Despite its unassuming appearance, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Found primarily in northern Europe and parts of Asia, it is often overlooked in favor of more showy flora. Its resilience and ecological importance make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
