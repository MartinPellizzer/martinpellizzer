                <h1>Adenanthera oudhensis</h1>
<p>Adenanthera oudhensis, commonly known as the Indian velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, hairy pods containing edible seeds that are rich in protein. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its nutritional value and ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Adenanthera oudhensis plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthera oudhensis has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 5-15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that exudes a milky sap when wounded. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in spikes, blooming from July to September, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are taproots with lateral branches, enabling the plant to thrive in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera oudhensis is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, including countries such as India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in dry deciduous forests and open grasslands. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Adenanthera oudhensis is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive yellow flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera oudhensis was mainly introduced to South Africa as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to local climates.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in various regions, including parts of the Eastern Cape and the Western Cape. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fencelines. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to spread and compete with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is classified as an invasive species in some areas.</p>
