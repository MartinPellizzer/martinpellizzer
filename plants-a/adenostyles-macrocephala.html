                <h1>Adenostyles macrocephala</h1>
<p>Adenostyles macrocephala, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are typically hairy and can grow up to several feet tall, supporting the flower heads.</p>
<p>Adenostyles macrocephala is adapted to rocky and dry environments, showcasing its resilience in harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles macrocephala has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a bushy, branching pattern. Its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal umbels, featuring small white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils and helping it thrive in dry, rocky habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles macrocephala is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the chaparral and coastal scrub ecosystems. This plant thrives in areas with mild, wet winters and dry summers. It is often associated with rocky soils and is a characteristic component of the California flora.</p>
<p>Adenostyles macrocephala is also found in parts of Oregon and Baja California, Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles macrocephala was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and parts of Oregon.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is commonly found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub ecosystems. This plant is often associated with disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in areas with minimal competition. Due to its aggressive growth, it has been classified as an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities and ecosystem balance.</p>
