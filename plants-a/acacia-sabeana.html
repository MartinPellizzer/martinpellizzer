                    <h1>Acacia sabeana</h1>
<p>Acacia sabeana, commonly known as the pale acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless branches and small, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. Acacia sabeana is well-suited to drought conditions and is often found in savanna and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife in its native environment.</p>
