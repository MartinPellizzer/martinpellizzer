<p>Acorus angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and slightly glossy. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe.</p>
<p>Acorus angustifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
