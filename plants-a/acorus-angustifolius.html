                <h1>Acorus angustifolius</h1>
<p>Acorus angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and slightly glossy. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe.</p>
<p>Acorus angustifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus angustifolius has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear and tapering, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant, with a dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stout, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright from the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in a spadix enclosed by a spathe, blooming in early to mid-summer, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spadix that develops into a cluster of small berries, which are dispersed by water and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense underground network that helps the plant spread and anchor itself.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus angustifolius is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats, such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving streams. This plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments and is often associated with muddy or sandy soils. It is also known to occur in parts of southern China and northern Australia.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes tropical and subtropical regions where there is consistent moisture and warm temperatures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus angustifolius was mainly introduced to aquatic and wetland environments due to its ability to thrive in shallow, water-saturated soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams where it can form dense stands. This plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and its role in stabilizing soil and improving water quality. However, it can become invasive in non-native regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded in areas with disturbed or nutrient-rich habitats.</p>
