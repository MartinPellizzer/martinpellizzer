                <h1>Acorus angustifolius</h1>
<p>Acorus angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in saturated soils. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly glossy. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in early summer.</p>
<p>Acorus angustifolius is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in water gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus angustifolius has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are bright green and arranged in a basal rosette, typically measuring up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is short and rhizomatous, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows horizontally underground. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in a spadix surrounded by a leaf-like bract, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed berry that ripens to a dark blue color, dispersing seeds by water and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomes that form dense colonies, helping the plant thrive in wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus angustifolius is a wetland plant native to eastern North America, including the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is now found in similar wetland environments across much of the northern hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and parts of the Middle East. This plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. It typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>While it is not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is threatened by wetland loss and pollution, leading to a vulnerable conservation status in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acorus angustifolius is a hardy, ornamental plant known for its narrow, sword-like leaves and ability to thrive in wet environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through rhizome division or by sowing seeds, with rhizome division being the most reliable method. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It prefers moist, well-draining soil and requires regular watering to maintain its lush appearance. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning dead foliage helps maintain its aesthetic appeal. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract snails and slugs in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with water-loving plants like iris or cattails can enhance its ecological value in wetland gardens.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acorus angustifolius is a wetland plant that provides food and shelter for various aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and insects with its fragrant flowers. It acts as a natural filter, improving water quality by absorbing excess nutrients. Its dense growth also helps prevent erosion along water edges.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves as a companion plant in wetland restoration projects, supporting biodiversity and ecosystem stability.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acorus angustifolius is a versatile plant with various uses across different fields.</p>
<p>In culinary applications, its rhizomes are used as a flavoring agent, particularly in traditional Asian cuisines. Medicinally, it has been used in herbal remedies for its purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties. Industrially, it contributes to the production of essential oils and has potential in bioremediation.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some indigenous traditions and is sometimes used in religious or ceremonial contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acorus angustifolius has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aureus' with its golden foliage and 'Variegatus' featuring striking yellow and green variegation. Hybrids such as Acorus Ã— griffithianus have been developed to enhance hardiness and aesthetic appeal. These plants are important in horticulture for their ability to thrive in wet conditions and their use in water gardens and bog landscapes.</p>
<p>Their adaptability makes them a favored choice for gardeners seeking resilient, low-maintenance plants.</p>
