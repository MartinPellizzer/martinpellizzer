                <h1>Adenostoma fasciculatum</h1>
<p>Adenostoma fasciculatum, commonly known as the chamise, is a shrub native to California and parts of Nevada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Chamise is an important component of chaparral ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostoma fasciculatum has needle-like leaves that are narrow, pointed, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the dry, rocky soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostoma fasciculatum is primarily native to California, Mexico Northwest.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats. This plant thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It is well adapted to the rocky and sandy soils of its native range.</p>
<p>Adenostoma fasciculatum plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecosystem balance.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostoma fasciculatum was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and full sun exposure, typically in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of California and parts of Oregon. This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Its introduction has been associated with both natural and human-mediated dispersal.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in many areas where it has established itself.</p>
