<p>Aeluropus laciniatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, coastal or desert conditions. The plant typically grows in dense mats, forming a low-growing vegetation that stabilizes soil and prevents erosion. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Aeluropus laciniatus plays an important ecological role in salt marshes and coastal dunes by providing habitat and contributing to soil structure.</p>
