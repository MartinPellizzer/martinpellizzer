                <h1>Aeluropus laciniatus</h1>
<p>Aeluropus laciniatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, coastal or desert conditions. The plant typically grows in dense mats, forming a low-growing vegetation that stabilizes soil and prevents erosion. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Aeluropus laciniatus plays an important ecological role in salt marshes and coastal dunes by providing habitat and contributing to soil structure.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus laciniatus has leaves that are narrow, blade-like, and finely dissected, giving them a feathery appearance, with a grass-like arrangement along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green, with a bluish tinge, and are relatively small, usually less than 5 cm in length. The stem is upright, cylindrical, and somewhat hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, and it grows in dense, clump-forming patterns. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that bloom from spring to summer, and they are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds through wind, and the root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid environments.</p>
