                    <h1>Acer ovatifolium</h1>
<p>Acer ovatifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 9 inches long and have a distinctive ovate shape with a pointed tip. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Acer ovatifolium is often found in subalpine and alpine zones, where it plays a significant role in local ecosystems.</p>
