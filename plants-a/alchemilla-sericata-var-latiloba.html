<p>Alchemilla sericata var. latiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, silver-green, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense, upright clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and its ability to thrive in shady conditions.</p>
