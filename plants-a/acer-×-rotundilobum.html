                <h1>Acer × rotundilobum</h1>
<p>Acer × rotundilobum, commonly known as the rounded-lobed maple, is a hybrid deciduous tree that exhibits a unique combination of characteristics from its parent species.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, grey bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are palmately lobed, with rounded tips and a deep green upper surface, turning vibrant red or yellow in the autumn. It produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × rotundilobum has leaves that are broadly ovate to rounded, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length and width.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, turning bright red or orange in the fall. The stem is smooth and reddish-brown, with a straight growth pattern and a somewhat woody texture as it matures. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in panicles during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × rotundilobum is a hybrid maple species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China, where it occurs naturally in the wild.</p>
<p>Currently, it is also cultivated in gardens and botanical collections across North America and Europe. It thrives in temperate climates, typically growing in well-drained soils in forested areas or along stream banks. This species is found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and the rarity of its occurrence in the wild, Acer × rotundilobum is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × rotundilobum is a hybrid maple known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle includes a period of rapid growth in spring and early summer, followed by a rest period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry spells but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and annual pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowers like coneflowers or herbs such as lavender can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
