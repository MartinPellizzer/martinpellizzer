<p>Asclepias parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features slender stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces pods that split open to release seeds with silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite and have a slightly hairy texture, while its milky sap contains cardenolides.</p>
<p>Asclepias parvifolia is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
