                    <h1>Alnus alpina</h1>
<p>Alnus alpina, commonly known as the mountain alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. Alnus alpina thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria.</p>
