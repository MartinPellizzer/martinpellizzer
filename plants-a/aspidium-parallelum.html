<p>Aspidium parallelum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium parallelum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
