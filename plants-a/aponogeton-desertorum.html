<p>Aponogeton desertorum, commonly known as the desert arrowhead, is a rare aquatic plant native to the arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, adding a unique ornamental value. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with minimal nutrient input.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
