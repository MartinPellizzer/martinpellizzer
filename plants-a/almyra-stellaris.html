<p>Almyra stellaris, commonly known as the starlight almyra, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy beneath. Its roots are fibrous and capable of storing nutrients, which helps it survive in less fertile soils.</p>
<p>Almyra stellaris is often found in woodland edges and meadows, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun.</p>
