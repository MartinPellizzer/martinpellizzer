                <h1>Achimenes elegans-multiflora</h1>
<p>Achimenes elegans-multiflora, commonly known as the everlasting bell, is a tropical perennial plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces numerous blooms throughout the growing season. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Achimenes elegans-multiflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and long-lasting blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes elegans-multiflora has heart-shaped leaves that are velvety in texture, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are tubular with a prominent spur, displaying vibrant pink to purple hues, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by hummingbirds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant store nutrients and survive periods of drought.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes elegans-multiflora is primarily native to tropical regions of South America, including Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical rainforests. This species is commonly found in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soil. It is often associated with mountainous terrain and cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, but its natural range remains concentrated in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes elegans-multiflora was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its showy, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white. It has been reported to spread into natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, its introduction has led to ecological impacts in some areas where it competes with native flora.</p>
