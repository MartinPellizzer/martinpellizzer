                    <h1>Andradia</h1>
<p>Andradia, commonly known as the "Brazilian nightshade," is a genus of flowering plants in the Solanaceae family.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plants are characterized by their showy, often colorful flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Andradia species typically have smooth, glossy leaves and produce small, fleshy fruits that are usually red or yellow.</p>
<p>Due to their toxic properties, they are often avoided in traditional medicine, though some species have been used for their purported medicinal effects.</p>
