                        <h1>Acer cappadocicum subsp. cappadocicum</h1>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>cappadocicum, commonly known as the Cappadocian maple, is a deciduous tree native to Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, clustered green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is well adapted to dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>

<p>cappadocicum belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of a complex vascular system and true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group of vascular plants that includes ferns, horsetails, and other primitive plants with a unique reproductive system.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that typically have a well-developed vascular system and produce flowers with a variety of structures. Its order is Sapindales, which includes a diverse group of flowering plants, many of which have distinctive fruit types such as capsules or drupes. Its family is Sapindaceae, commonly known as the soapberry family, which includes trees and shrubs with often showy flowers and fruits that may be toxic. Its genus is Acer, which consists of deciduous trees and shrubs commonly known as maples, characterized by their opposite leaves and samaroid fruits.</p>
<p>Its species is Acer cappadocicum, a maple species native to Turkey, known for its distinctive leaf shape and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
