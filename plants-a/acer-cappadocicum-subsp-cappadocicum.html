                <h1>Acer cappadocicum subsp. cappadocicum</h1>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>cappadocicum, commonly known as the Cappadocian maple, is a deciduous tree native to Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, turning vibrant red or orange in autumn. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>cappadocicum has palmately compound leaves that are lobed, with a broad ovate shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring up to 15 cm in length, displaying a vibrant green color during the growing season. The stem is straight and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a rapid growth pattern in suitable conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and arranged in upright panicles, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and wing structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and facilitating efficient nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>cappadocicum is a rare maple species native to southeastern Europe, specifically found in parts of Turkey, Greece, and Bulgaria. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Cappadocia region of Turkey, where it thrives in rocky, calcareous soils.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open woodlands and rocky slopes, often at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss and climate change, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique subspecies.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>cappadocicum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and unique, twisted trunk. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seed propagation requiring stratification to break dormancy. The tree has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity over several decades, making it ideal for long-term landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants that thrive in similar conditions, such as hostas or daylilies, can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>cappadocicum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a complex web of life. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>cappadocicum is a species of maple native to Turkey and parts of the Middle East, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its sap and leaves have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.</p>
<p>In industrial contexts, it contributes to local economies through timber and ornamental horticulture. Culturally, it holds symbolic importance in regions where it is found, often representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting local biodiversity also makes it valuable for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum subsp.</p>
<p>cappadocicum has several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson King' and 'Sutherlandii', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and ornamental appeal. It is also involved in the creation of hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the diversity of maple trees in horticulture.</p>
<p>These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in landscaping for their aesthetic value and adaptability to various climates. The species holds significant horticultural importance due to its ability to thrive in cooler regions and its visual impact in autumn.</p>
<p>Its cultivation enhances both residential and public landscapes with its striking foliage and seasonal beauty.</p>
