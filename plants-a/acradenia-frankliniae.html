                <h1>Acradenia frankliniae</h1>
<p>Acradenia frankliniae, commonly known as Franklin's acradenia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acradenia frankliniae has simple, lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, fragrant flowers are white to pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the summer months, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acradenia frankliniae is primarily native to Tasmania.</p>
<p>This species is found in the eastern and central regions of the island, particularly in areas with moist, temperate climates. It typically grows in forested areas and along the edges of wetlands. The plant is well adapted to the cool, humid conditions of Tasmania's native vegetation.</p>
<p>It is an important part of the local flora and is often found in understory layers of native forests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acradenia frankliniae was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or loamy soils and a warm, temperate climate.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate to high levels of sunlight. This plant is often found in coastal regions and is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. It is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>The distribution of Acradenia frankliniae is primarily in southern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
