<p>Anoectochilus gengmanensis, commonly known as the Gengman's slipper orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of northern Thailand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique slipper-shaped lip, which is a defining feature of the Anoectochilus genus. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a sympodial growth habit, producing erect, hairy stems that bear a few lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually small, with a distinctive coloration that ranges from greenish-white to pale yellow, and it blooms during the cooler months of the year.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
