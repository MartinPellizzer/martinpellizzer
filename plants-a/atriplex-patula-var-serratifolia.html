<p>Atriplex patula var. serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves with serrated edges, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to saline soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
