                <h1>Acourtia humboldtii</h1>
<p>Acourtia humboldtii, commonly known as Humboldt's acourtia, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small, yellowish to reddish, and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Acourtia humboldtii is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for local pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia humboldtii has basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically hairy, arranged in a rosette, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense coating of trichomes.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually grayish-brown in color. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia humboldtii is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in coastal and inland areas within these regions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Acourtia humboldtii is well adapted to the local climate and plays a role in the native flora of these areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its ecological preferences and historical range across central and eastern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia humboldtii was mainly introduced to coastal areas of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils near the shore. This plant thrives in environments with moderate to high salinity and can tolerate periodic flooding. It is often seen growing along the base of dunes or in tidal zones.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become an important part of the local coastal ecosystem.</p>
