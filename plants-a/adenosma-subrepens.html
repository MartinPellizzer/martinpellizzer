                <h1>Adenosma subrepens</h1>
<p>Adenosma subrepens, commonly known as creeping adenosma, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adenosma subrepens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma subrepens has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is prostrate, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that grows along the ground. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma subrepens is a low-growing flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has expanded to include parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands, often as a result of human introduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as understorey areas of tropical forests and along stream banks. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 50 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Despite its widespread presence, Adenosma subrepens is considered a least concern for conservation status due to its adaptability and lack of significant threats.</p>
