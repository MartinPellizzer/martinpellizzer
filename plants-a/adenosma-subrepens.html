                <h1>Adenosma subrepens</h1>
<p>Adenosma subrepens, commonly known as creeping adenosma, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their ornamental and medicinal value. The plant features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its small, opposite leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Adenosma subrepens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along streambanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma subrepens has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is prostrate, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown color, growing along the ground and branching profusely. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with white to pale pink petals, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma subrepens is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in forest undergrowth and is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of the Indian subcontinent, including India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends to some Pacific islands, where it grows in similar ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma subrepens was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and gardening.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and areas with poor vegetation cover. This plant has a creeping growth habit, allowing it to spread rapidly and colonize new areas. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature.</p>
<p>Its distribution is expanding as a result of both natural and anthropogenic factors.</p>
