<p>Aralia paniculata, commonly known as the American aralia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in large, umbrella-like clusters called panicles, which appear in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans.</p>
<p>Aralia paniculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
