<p>Andropogon cryptopodus, commonly known as the underground grass or cryptopodus grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, typically with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Andropogon cryptopodus is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
