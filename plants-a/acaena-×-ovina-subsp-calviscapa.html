<p>Acaena × ovina subsp.</p>
<p>calviscapa, commonly known as the coastal acaena, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, spiny fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>The plant has compound leaves with several pairs of leaflets, and its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
