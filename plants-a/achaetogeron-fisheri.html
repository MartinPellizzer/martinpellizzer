                    <h1>Achaetogeron fisheri</h1>
<p>Achaetogeron fisheri, commonly known as the Fisher's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, almost translucent fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments, typically in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with sporangia clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
