                        <h1>Abutilon blepharocarpum</h1>
<p>Abutilon blepharocarpum, commonly known as the "earleaf abutilon," is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces unique, inflated seed pods that split open to release seeds.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon blepharocarpum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Thailand, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. This plant thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing along the edges of forests or in disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across several regions where it adapts well to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon blepharocarpum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped fruits.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturalists or through accidental introduction via shipping. The plant has since become naturalized in some areas, thriving in disturbed soils and coastal environments. It is commonly found in urban and agricultural settings, often growing along roadsides and in vacant lots.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread readily.</p>
