                <h1>Achillea sudetica</h1>
<p>Achillea sudetica, commonly known as the Sudetic yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pinkish in color. The plant typically grows in dry meadows, rocky soils, and open woodlands, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched.</p>
<p>Achillea sudetica is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sudetica has compound, bipinnate leaves that are finely divided, arranged alternately along the stem, and are typically gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and branched, with a smooth, light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more reddish with age. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, arranged in flat, composite flower heads, and bloom from June to August; they are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, allowing for wind dispersal, and the seeds are small and numerous.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sudetica is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly the Sudetes and Carpathian ranges.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine areas, growing in rocky and well-drained soils. This plant is also present in parts of Eastern Europe, including the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia. It thrives in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and forest edges at elevations ranging from 800 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely tied to the climatic and geological conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sudetica was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the northeastern United States. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of environments. Its spread has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to outcompete native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, careful management is recommended to prevent its invasive spread.</p>
