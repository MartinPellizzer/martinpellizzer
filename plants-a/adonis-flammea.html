                <h1>Adonis flammea</h1>
<p>Adonis flammea, commonly known as the flame bellflower, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear clusters of bright orange-red, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Adonis flammea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and naturalized areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis flammea has simple, alternate, and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green in color, with a smooth texture and typically measure up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unbranched throughout its growth. Its flowers are showy, consisting of five pinkish-red petals arranged in a cup-like shape, blooming in early summer and attracting insect pollinators such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis flammea is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, and Greece.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of North Africa, including Morocco and Algeria. This plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is commonly found in mountainous regions. It prefers sunny to partially shaded environments and is often seen in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis flammea was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and gardening.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open areas, often spreading along roadsides and in urban environments. The plant thrives in temperate climates and can establish itself quickly in areas with poor vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, it is generally not considered a major threat to native ecosystems in its introduced range.</p>
