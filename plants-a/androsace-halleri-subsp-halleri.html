<p>Androsace halleri subsp.</p>
<p>halleri, commonly known as the Haller's Androsace, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has basal leaves that are usually rounded or heart-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
