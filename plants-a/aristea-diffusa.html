<p>Aristea diffusa, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that form a mat-like appearance, often covered in a fine layer of white to silver hairs. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
