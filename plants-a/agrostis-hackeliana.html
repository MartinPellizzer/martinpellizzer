                    <h1>Agrostis hackeliana</h1>
<p>Agrostis hackeliana, commonly known as the Hackel's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for shady, moist environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in woodland or grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Agrostis hackeliana is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants in shaded, forested areas.</p>
