                    <h1>Angorkis alcicornis</h1>
<p>Angorkis alcicornis, commonly known as the silver-veined orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale green leaves with distinct silver veins and its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several national parks.</p>
