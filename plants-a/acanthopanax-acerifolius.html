<p>Acanthopanax acerifolius, commonly known as the maple-leaf dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves that resemble those of maple trees, with elongated leaflets and serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation.</p>

<p>Acanthopanax acerifolius is primarily native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions with temperate climates. This plant thrives in forests and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. It is particularly associated with the temperate forests of the Korean Peninsula and southern parts of China.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes areas with well-drained soil and moderate rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax acerifolius was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in forested regions.</p>
