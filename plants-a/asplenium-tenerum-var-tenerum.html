<p>Asplenium tenerum var. tenerum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, dark green fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation.</p>
