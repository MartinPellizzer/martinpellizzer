<p>Acharagma roseanum, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety red petals and sepals, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, producing clusters of fragrant blooms.</p>
<p>Acharagma roseanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acharagma roseanum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acharagma roseanum is a flowering plant native to the western Himalayas, primarily found in India and Nepal.</p>
