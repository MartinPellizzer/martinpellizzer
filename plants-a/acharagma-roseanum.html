                <h1>Acharagma roseanum</h1>
<p>Acharagma roseanum, commonly known as the pink stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging nettles. The plant is characterized by its upright stems covered in fine, irritating hairs that release formic acid when touched. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are typically pale green to pinkish in color.</p>
<p>Acharagma roseanum is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acharagma roseanum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. It produces small, clustered pinkish-white flowers with five petals, blooming in spring, and is pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acharagma roseanum is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India, a region known for its rich biodiversity.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in specific areas of this mountain range, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments, typically found in the undergrowth of evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Acharagma roseanum is listed as endangered due to habitat destruction and over-collection, making it a priority for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acharagma roseanum is a unique plant known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Acharagma roseanum includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant and encourage bushiness are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by aphids and root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acharagma roseanum is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit acts as shelter for small mammals and birds, offering protection from predators and harsh weather. It also functions as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops by improving soil health and reducing pest infestation. Additionally, its extensive root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Acharagma roseanum contributes to the overall biodiversity of its habitat by supporting various wildlife species and promoting ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acharagma roseanum is a versatile plant with various uses across different domains.</p>
<p>In culinary applications, its leaves are used in traditional dishes, adding a unique flavor and texture. Medicinally, it has been utilized in herbal remedies for its purported health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Industrially, the plant contributes to local economies through agricultural practices and the production of natural dyes.</p>
