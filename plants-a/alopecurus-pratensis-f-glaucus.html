<p>Alopecurus pratensis f. glaucus, commonly known as the blue meadowgrass, is a variant of the meadow grass species characterized by its distinctive blue-gray foliage.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist meadows and grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland and meadow ecosystems.</p>
