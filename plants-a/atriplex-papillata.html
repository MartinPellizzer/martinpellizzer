                    <h1>Atriplex papillata</h1>
<p>Atriplex papillata, commonly known as shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is adapted to thrive in saline and alkaline soils. Atriplex papillata plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
<p>Its resilience to harsh conditions makes it a key species in desert ecosystems.</p>
