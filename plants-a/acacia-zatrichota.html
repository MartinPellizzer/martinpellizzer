                    <h1>Acacia zatrichota</h1>
<p>Acacia zatrichota, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize sandy or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Acacia zatrichota is also known for its role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
