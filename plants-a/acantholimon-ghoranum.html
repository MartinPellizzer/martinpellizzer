Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and often spore-producing reproductive structures. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is characterized by a wide range of morphological diversity.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants with distinctive floral structures and often contains species adapted to arid environments. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly known as the leadwort family, characterized by their often showy flowers and sometimes toxic compounds. Its genus is Acantholimon, a genus of flowering plants typically found in arid regions, known for their succulent leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon ghoranum, a specific plant species within the genus Acantholimon, native to certain regions and distinguished by its unique morphological and ecological characteristics.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon ghoranum is primarily native to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It is typically found in rocky and arid environments within the country. This plant is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region. It is often seen growing in mountainous areas and along rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in Afghanistan.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon ghoranum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high elevations, typically found in mountainous or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun exposure and is commonly found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of the Mediterranean and Central Asia.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely influenced by human activity and ecological conditions that support its growth.</p>
