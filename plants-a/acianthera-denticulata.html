                <h1>Acianthera denticulata</h1>
<p>Acianthera denticulata, commonly known as the toothed orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate floral structure and vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Acianthera denticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera denticulata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a serrated margin and a dark green, glossy upper surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody, with a pale greenish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and arranged in clusters, featuring white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera denticulata is primarily native to Cuba and Haiti.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical regions of these Caribbean islands. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within forests. The plant is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera denticulata was mainly introduced to new habitats in the southern United States, particularly in Florida and Texas, where it has become established in disturbed and wetland areas.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist to semi-aquatic conditions. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in these ecosystems. The plant spreads primarily through its rhizomes and seeds, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly.</p>
<p>As a non-native species, it is monitored for its impact on local biodiversity and ecosystem health.</p>
