<p>Asplenium auriculatum, commonly known as the ear-shaped spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices, stream banks, and woodland floors. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with small, ear-like lobes at the base, giving it its common name. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium auriculatum is relatively hardy and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common sight in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
