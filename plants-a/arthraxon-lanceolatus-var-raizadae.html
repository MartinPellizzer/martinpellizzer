                    <h1>Arthraxon lanceolatus var. raizadae</h1>
<p>Arthraxon lanceolatus var. raizadae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arthraxon, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and compact inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and wetland habitats. Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a component of local grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The variety raizadae is distinguished by subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Arthraxon lanceolatus.</p>
