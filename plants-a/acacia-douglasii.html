                    <h1>Acacia douglasii</h1>
<p>Acacia douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas acacia, is a shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Acacia douglasii is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry landscapes.</p>
