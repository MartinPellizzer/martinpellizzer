                <h1>Adenodolichos helenae</h1>
<p>Adenodolichos helenae, commonly known as the Helen's climbing bean, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant features tendrils that allow it to climb and attach to supports, making it a common sight in rocky or coastal areas. Its flowers are typically small and pea-like, with a distinctive pink or purple hue.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods and are often used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos helenae has leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly woody with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white to pale pink, clustered in racemose inflorescences, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos helenae is primarily native to DR Congo and Zambia.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in forested areas and along riverbanks. The species is part of the legume family and plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos helenae was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits.</p>
<p>It has since spread to other areas, including parts of southern Europe and western Asia, where it has established itself in disturbed habitats. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought have contributed to its widespread distribution. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to monitor and manage its spread to prevent ecological harm.</p>
