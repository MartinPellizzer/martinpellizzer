                <h1>Achillea multiplex</h1>
<p>Achillea multiplex, commonly known as yarrow, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is characterized by its flat-topped clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant has feathery, aromatic leaves and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides. It is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<p>Achillea multiplex is a hardy perennial that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea multiplex has basal leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a gray-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and reddish-brown in color, growing from the base and branching sparingly. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea multiplex is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution extends to temperate regions of the United States, particularly in California and the Pacific Northwest, where it has been introduced. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is considered invasive in some areas, it is generally not listed as endangered and is often found in naturalized populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea multiplex is a hardy perennial known for its daisy-like flowers and resilience in various garden settings.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a period of active growth in spring, flowering in early summer, and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning after flowering help maintain its vigor. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, thyme, or marigolds can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea multiplex is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts beneficial insects and wildlife, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem. This plant acts as a companion plant, often growing well alongside other flowering plants to enhance garden diversity. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Achillea multiplex also plays a role in improving soil health by fixing nitrogen, making it a valuable addition to ecological restoration projects.</p>
