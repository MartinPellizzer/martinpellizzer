                <h1>Achillea multiplex</h1>
<p>Achillea multiplex, commonly known as yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a creeping rhizome and can grow up to 60 cm tall, with basal leaves that are pinnately divided. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in flat-topped clusters called cymes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its botanical name honors Achilles, the legendary Greek warrior, due to its historical use in treating wounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea multiplex has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark, and grows in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are flat-topped clusters (corymbs) of small, white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea multiplex is primarily native to Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, including countries such as France, Italy, Spain, and Greece.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and dry soils, often found in meadows, hillsides, and open woodlands. This plant is known for its fragrant, flat-topped clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has been introduced to other regions, including parts of North America, where it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Despite its widespread cultivation, it remains most closely associated with its native European habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea multiplex was mainly introduced to control erosion and as an ornamental plant in gardens due to its hardy nature and attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides where it can thrive in full sun. This plant has been spread through seed dispersal by wind and water, leading to its establishment in various habitats. Its rapid growth and adaptability have made it a potential weed in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered beneficial for stabilizing soil and providing habitat for pollinators.</p>
