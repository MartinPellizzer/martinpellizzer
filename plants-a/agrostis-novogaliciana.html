                    <h1>Agrostis novogaliciana</h1>
<p>Agrostis novogaliciana, commonly known as the Galician bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Galicia in northwestern Spain.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to maritime climates with high salinity and strong winds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is often found in dune ecosystems and is valued for its ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat.</p>
