<p>Agropyron pungens subsp.</p>
<p>athericum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control.</p>
