<p>Armeria maghrebensis, commonly known as the Moroccan thrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Morocco.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Armeria maghrebensis is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
