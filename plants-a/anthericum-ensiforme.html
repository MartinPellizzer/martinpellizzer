<p>Anthericum ensiforme, commonly known as the sword fern, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sword-shaped, evergreen leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in small, upright clusters called sori on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Anthericum ensiforme make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>
