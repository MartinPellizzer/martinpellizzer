                        <h1>Acacia strigulosa</h1>
<p>Acacia strigulosa, commonly known as the rough wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and yellow flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Acacia strigulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia strigulosa is primarily native to Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country, particularly in the coastal and Andean foothill areas. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in dry shrublands and coastal dunes. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Acacia strigulosa is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia strigulosa was mainly introduced to areas with dry, sandy soils and low rainfall, typically in regions with a Mediterranean or arid climate.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops where it can thrive with minimal water. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber or fuelwood in its introduced range. Its rapid growth and hardy nature make it a popular choice for reclamation projects.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
