                <h1>Adactylus latifolius</h1>
<p>Adactylus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf adactylus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant features compound leaves with broad, flat leaflets that are often used in traditional herbal medicine. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>Adactylus latifolius is valued for its medicinal properties and is often cultivated in gardens for both its ornamental and therapeutic uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adactylus latifolius has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and reddish-brown in color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to absorb moisture from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adactylus latifolius is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, dry, and sunny environments, often found in mountainous areas and along coastal cliffs. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, which are characteristic of its native range. It is commonly seen in regions such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the specific ecological conditions of these areas, making it a typical example of Mediterranean flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adactylus latifolius was mainly introduced to new habitats due to its adaptability and rapid growth rate.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions where it has established itself in disturbed soils and open areas. This plant can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns in invaded regions. Its spread is often associated with human activities such as gardening and land development.</p>
<p>Monitoring and management strategies are essential to control its proliferation and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
