                <h1>Acronychia pedunculata</h1>
<p>Acronychia pedunculata, commonly known as the rock apple or mountain apple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its small, smooth, elliptical leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that are borne in clusters. Its fruit is a small, round, yellowish drupe that matures to a red or orange color.</p>
<p>Acronychia pedunculata is often found growing on rocky slopes and in disturbed habitats, and it plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for various animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia pedunculata has leaves that are elliptical or lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often branched, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually grey or brown in color. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a woody drupe, containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to the presence of tufts of hair.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia pedunculata is primarily native to the Andaman Is., Assam, Bangladesh, Borneo, Cambodia, China South-Central, China Southeast, East Himalaya, Hainan, India, Jawa, Laos, Malaya, Myanmar, New Guinea, Nicobar Is., Philippines, Sri Lanka, Sulawesi, Sumatera, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and West Himalaya.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in lowland forests and mountainous areas. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. Acronychia pedunculata is typically associated with secondary forests and is sometimes found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its wide distribution across Southeast Asia and parts of South and East Asia reflects its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia pedunculata was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high sunlight exposure and moderate to high rainfall. This plant is often cultivated in gardens and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and ornamental value. It is commonly found in regions such as Southeast Asia, Northern Australia, and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been largely for horticultural purposes rather than for ecological or agricultural use.</p>
