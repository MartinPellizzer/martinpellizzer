                <h1>Acmena brachyandra</h1>
<p>Acmena brachyandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved apple tree, is a species of flowering plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 8 meters in height, featuring a spreading canopy and smooth, greyish bark. The leaves are lance-shaped, glossy green on the upper surface, and have a distinctive whitish underside. Its flowers are small, white to pink, and appear in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits that are a food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a range of soil types in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena brachyandra has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom during the spring to early summer, being pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena brachyandra is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in subtropical and temperate regions, particularly in coastal and coastal heathland areas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with open forests and woodlands. It is known for its small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>Acmena brachyandra is an important component of the local flora and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena brachyandra was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Australia, as part of ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique fruiting structures.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in urban and suburban areas, particularly in gardens and parks. The plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for agricultural or ecological purposes. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has the potential to naturalize and spread beyond cultivated areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to regions with a subtropical to temperate climate.</p>
