                        <h1>Acer subglaucum</h1>
<p>Acer subglaucum, commonly known as the white maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common trait among maple species. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves, and it typically blooms in early spring.</p>
<p>The white maple is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas.</p>
