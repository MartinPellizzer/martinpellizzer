<p>Alsophila major, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy material called the rachis. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Alsophila major plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitats.</p>
