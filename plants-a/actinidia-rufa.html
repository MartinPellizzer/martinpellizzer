                <h1>Actinidia rufa</h1>
<p>Actinidia rufa, commonly known as the red actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that turn a striking red or orange color in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that give way to edible, fuzzy berries. These berries are often consumed by birds and can be used in jams and wines.</p>
<p>It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia rufa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it grows as a climbing or trailing vine. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and borne in clusters, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, bright red berry that matures in late summer, dispersing primarily through birds and other animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself while spreading along the ground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia rufa is primarily native to Japan, Korea, Nansei-shoto, and Taiwan.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in temperate regions of these areas. It thrives in woodland and shrubland habitats. The species is known for its edible fruits and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its natural range reflects its adaptation to the climate and soil conditions of East Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia rufa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive red berries and climbing habit. The introduction occurred primarily in the late 19th and early 20th centuries through horticultural trade. It has since naturalized in some areas, posing a potential threat to native plant communities.</p>
<p>Its spread is monitored due to its invasive potential in certain ecosystems.</p>
