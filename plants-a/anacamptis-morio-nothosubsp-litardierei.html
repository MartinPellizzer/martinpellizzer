<p>Anacamptis morio nothosubsp.</p>
<p>litardierei, commonly known as the litardiere's early gentian, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a white throat, which bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. It has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomatous stems that produce multiple flowering shoots.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation priority in its native range.</p>
