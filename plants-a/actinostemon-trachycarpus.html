                <h1>Actinostemon trachycarpus</h1>
<p>Actinostemon trachycarpus, commonly known as the rough-seeded actinostemon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems covered in rough, hairy textures, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemon trachycarpus has broad, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, featuring a simple structure with separate male and female parts, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb moisture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon trachycarpus is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. This species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It is commonly associated with fynbos vegetation, which is characteristic of the Cape Floral Kingdom.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with dry summers and wet winters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon trachycarpus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native species. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, making it particularly problematic in forested regions.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
