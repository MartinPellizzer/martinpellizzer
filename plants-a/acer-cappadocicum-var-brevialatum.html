                <h1>Acer cappadocicum var. brevialatum</h1>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. brevialatum, commonly known as the short-leaved maple, is a rare and distinctive variety of the maple tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique leaf morphology, with shorter, broader leaves compared to the typical maple species. The plant is native to specific regions in Turkey and is adapted to rocky, arid environments. Its leaves are typically a vibrant green during the growing season and turn reddish-orange in the fall.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological niche in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. brevialatum has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and often exhibits a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, arranged in catkins, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed that is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's natural habitat in rocky or dry environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. brevialatum is a rare and critically endangered variant of the maple tree native to the Cappadocia region of Turkey.</p>
<p>Its native range is restricted to a few rocky outcrops in central Anatolia, where it thrives in dry, sunny environments. Although historically found in a few specific locations, its current distribution is limited to a single site in the Tavşanlı area, due to habitat loss and degradation. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 1,500 meters, preferring well-drained soils and limestone substrates.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing, but the species remains critically endangered due to its extremely limited population and fragile habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. brevialatum is a compact maple variety known for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in about 5 to 7 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. brevialatum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and supporting other plant species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system, which stabilizes soil and prevents runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence helps maintain the ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. brevialatum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its seeds may be processed for oil or as a minor food source in certain regions.</p>
<p>It has potential medicinal applications due to the presence of bioactive compounds that may support anti-inflammatory or antioxidant properties. Industrially, it is not widely utilized, but its wood could be valuable for small-scale crafts or furniture due to its structural qualities. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in local traditions and may be used in ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>However, its role remains underexplored compared to more common maple species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. brevialatum has a limited number of recognized varieties, with its most notable cultivars including 'Crimson King' and 'Orange Queen', both prized for their vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>While it is not widely hybridized due to its specific genetic makeup, some horticulturists have attempted to cross it with other maple species to create unique foliage patterns. These cultivars are particularly valued in ornamental horticulture for their striking leaf color and compact growth habit. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to add seasonal interest to gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it remains a sought-after specimen among advanced gardeners and plant collectors.</p>
