<p>Allium schoenoprasum subsp.</p>
<p>sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian chives, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, white or pale purple flowers in umbels.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its aromatic, garlic-like scent, which is due to the presence of sulfur-containing compounds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
