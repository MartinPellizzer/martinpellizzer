                <h1>Aechmea bahiana</h1>
<p>Aechmea bahiana, commonly known as the Bahian velvet plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a dense, woolly coating. The plant forms a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its flowers are usually red or orange, emerging from the leaf axils in a showy display.</p>
<p>Aechmea bahiana thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea bahiana has rosette-shaped leaves that are typically lanceolate, stiff, and arranged in a compact spiral, with a waxy green color and a dark midrib.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, with the leaves forming a dense rosette that protects the central inflorescence. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, with pinkish-white blooms that appear during the summer months and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed berry that disperses seeds through animals after ripening.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in rocky or dry environments.</p>
