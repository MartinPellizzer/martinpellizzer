                <h1>Acilepis nayarii</h1>
<p>Acilepis nayarii, commonly known as the Mexican sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, hot environments. Its leaves are often narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acilepis nayarii is an important component of local ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis nayarii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length; they are usually dark green with a slightly glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a pale yellow color, blooming during the spring season; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis nayarii is primarily native to India.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of the country, particularly in the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka. This plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments, often near water bodies or in dense forests. It is known for its unique floral structures and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>However, its natural habitat remains largely restricted to specific areas within India.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis nayarii was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in humid environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and ample sunlight. This plant has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. Its introduction has often been associated with horticultural and ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>However, it has also raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
