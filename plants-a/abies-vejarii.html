                    <h1>Abies vejarii</h1>
<p>Abies vejarii, commonly known as the Vejari fir, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant exhibits a distinct morphology with a tall, slender trunk and a conical crown, typical of many fir species. Its botanical features include resinous sap and a preference for cool, moist, and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Abies vejarii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
