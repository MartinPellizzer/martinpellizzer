<p>Acalypha parvifolia, commonly known as the littleleaf spurge or small-leaved marvel, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and have a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is usually shrub-like, with multiple stems arising from the base.</p>
<p>Acalypha parvifolia is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in partial to full sun.</p>

<p>Acalypha parvifolia has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. The flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, consisting of tiny, greenish-white bracts that surround small, pale yellow flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed schizocarp that splits into three dry, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha parvifolia is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other tropical regions, including parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in lowland rainforests or along stream banks. It is generally found at altitudes between 0 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acalypha parvifolia is considered a species of conservation concern in its native areas.</p>
