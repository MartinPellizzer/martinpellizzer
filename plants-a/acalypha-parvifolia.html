<p>Acalypha parvifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha parvifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in forest understories or near water bodies. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, such as Samoa and Hawaii, where it has been introduced.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be found in disturbed habitats or along roadsides in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha parvifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant because of its ability to thrive in a variety of light conditions. The plant is native to Southeast Asia but has been widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions around the world.
