                    <h1>Arum dioscoridis f. atropurpureum</h1>
<p>Arum dioscoridis f. atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple-leaf arum, is a striking ornamental plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish-purple underside, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a showy, purple spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its dramatic foliage and unique flowering structure.</p>
<p>However, it contains calcium oxalate crystals, making it potentially toxic if ingested.</p>
