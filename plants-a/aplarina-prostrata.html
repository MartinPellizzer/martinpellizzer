                    <h1>Aplarina prostrata</h1>
<p>Aplarina prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with thin, ribbon-like leaves that lie flat on the water surface or submerged substrates. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used for trapping small aquatic organisms. These vesicles are typically transparent and can be found in clusters along the stems.</p>
<p>Aplarina prostrata is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches.</p>
