                    <h1>Allocarya limicola</h1>
<p>Allocarya limicola, commonly known as the salt marsh dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that primarily inhabits coastal salt marshes.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants, drawing nutrients and water through its haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a succulent, cylindrical stem covered in fine hairs. It is adapted to saline environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it is considered a rare and often overlooked species in botanical studies.</p>
