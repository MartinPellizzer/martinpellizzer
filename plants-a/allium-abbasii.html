                    <h1>Allium abbasii</h1>
<p>Allium abbasii, commonly known as the Kashmiri leek, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are often used in local cuisines for their mild, onion-like flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to grow in rocky or alpine soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allium abbasii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
