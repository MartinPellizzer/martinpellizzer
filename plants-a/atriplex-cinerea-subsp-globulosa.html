<p>Atriplex cinerea subsp.</p>
<p>globulosa, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in globular inflorescences, giving it its subspecific name. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its succulent leaves and stems store water, allowing it to survive in low-nutrient, dry conditions.</p>
