                        <h1>Acer caesium</h1>
<p>Acer caesium, commonly known as the golden maple, is a species of maple native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 20 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed with five to seven segments, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acer caesium belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and algae that have a complex life cycle involving a multicellular gametophyte. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns, horsetails, and some related plants, characterized by their vascular systems and often primitive features. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species, known for their diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Sapindales, a group of flowering plants that includes trees and shrubs, many of which produce fruits with a hard outer covering. Its family is Sapindaceae, commonly known as the soapberry family, which includes trees and shrubs with often showy flowers and fruits that may contain toxins. Its genus is Acer, which includes maple trees, known for their distinctive palmate leaves and colorful autumn foliage.</p>
<p>Its species is Acer caesium, a specific type of maple tree native to eastern Asia, characterized by its ornamental value and unique leaf patterns.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer caesium is primarily native to Afghanistan, China North-Central, China South-Central, China Southeast, Inner Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Tibet, and the West Himalaya.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in mountainous regions within these areas. It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with forested or rocky terrain. The plant is well adapted to the varied elevations and environmental conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for cooler, high-altitude habitats across these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer caesium was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental tree due to its striking autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the continent in the early 20th century by horticulturalists seeking to diversify the landscape with non-native species. The plant has since been planted in gardens and parks across the eastern United States. However, it has not become invasive and is generally considered a non-native but non-invasive species.</p>
<p>Its introduction has primarily been for aesthetic purposes rather than ecological or agricultural use.</p>
