                <h1>Acer caesium</h1>
<p>Acer caesium, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, palmate leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length and turn bright red or orange in the fall. It produces small, red or yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds.</p>
<p>Acer caesium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer caesium has leaves that are palmately lobed, typically with five to seven lobes, arranged alternately along the stem, and measure about 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, turning vibrant yellow in autumn. The stem is slender with smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during spring, with a structure of five petals, and they are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod, which is dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer caesium is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas, specifically found in countries like India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of China and Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, temperate environments, often growing in mountainous areas with rich, well-drained soils. This species is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, Acer caesium is considered a rare species with a conservation status of vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer caesium is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and elegant growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer caesium includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with plants like hostas or ferns in a shaded garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer caesium is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other plant species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that helps bind the soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer caesium contributes to carbon sequestration, supporting overall environmental health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer caesium is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value, often planted in gardens and parks for its vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
