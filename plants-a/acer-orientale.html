                <h1>Acer orientale</h1>
<p>Acer orientale, commonly known as the oriental maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Acer orientale is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer orientale has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, turning red or yellow in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer orientale is a species of maple native to the eastern part of the Mediterranean region, including areas of Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few fragmented populations in its native range. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in mountainous areas with a Mediterranean climate. The plant typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer orientale is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer orientale is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle of Acer orientale involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally suffer from aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>
