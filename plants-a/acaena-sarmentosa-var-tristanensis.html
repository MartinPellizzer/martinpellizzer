                    <h1>Acaena sarmentosa var. tristanensis</h1>
<p>Acaena sarmentosa var. tristanensis, commonly known as the Tristan alpine cushion, is a low-growing shrub native to the subantarctic islands of the Tristan da Cunha group.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, spiny leaves that are typically covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in harsh, windy environments and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its remote, isolated environment.</p>
