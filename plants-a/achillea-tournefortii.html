                <h1>Achillea tournefortii</h1>
<p>Achillea tournefortii, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems and basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads composed of small white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and long flowering period make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea tournefortii has leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-gray upper surface and a lighter underside; they are typically 5–15 cm long and 0.5–2 cm wide.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, often branched, with a rough, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a clumping manner. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called cymes, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tournefortii is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as France, Spain, Italy, and Greece. This plant thrives in rocky and coastal areas, often growing in dry, sunny environments. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and can be found in scrublands and maquis vegetation.</p>
<p>Its native range includes the Balearic Islands and parts of North Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tournefortii was mainly introduced to Mediterranean regions, particularly in southern Europe and North Africa, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since spread to other parts of the world, including parts of the United States and Australia, where it has become naturalized in certain ecosystems. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry, open habitats, which contributes to its successful establishment in new areas. Its introduction has raised concerns in some regions due to its potential to become invasive and compete with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, careful management is often required to prevent its spread in non-native environments.</p>
