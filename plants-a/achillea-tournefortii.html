                <h1>Achillea tournefortii</h1>
<p>Achillea tournefortii, commonly known as the French yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous growth habit and is often found in rocky or dry soils. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Achillea tournefortii is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea tournefortii has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are basal and arranged in a rosette, with a rough, hairy texture and a bluish-gray color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a reddish-brown color, growing in a丛生 pattern. Its flower heads are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray flowers, blooming from May to July, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and deep, helping the plant to anchor itself and access water in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tournefortii is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern France, Spain, and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends beyond its native range due to human introduction, now growing in regions with similar climates. This plant thrives in rocky, dry soils and is commonly found in scrublands and coastal areas. It typically grows at altitudes between 0 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, its conservation status is considered stable due to its adaptability and widespread presence.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea tournefortii is a hardy, drought-tolerant perennial known for its feathery foliage and vibrant yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing established clumps, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a short growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and going dormant in the winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscapes. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>While it is generally resistant to pests and diseases, aphids and powdery mildew can occasionally affect it, and it pairs well with drought-tolerant companions like lavender and yarrow.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea tournefortii is a hardy, drought-resistant plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as an effective erosion control measure due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil in arid and coastal environments. It also serves as a companion plant for other drought-tolerant species in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
<p>Its ecological benefits make it a valuable component of Mediterranean and dryland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea tournefortii is a perennial herb known for its medicinal properties, commonly used in traditional medicine to treat digestive issues and as an antispasmodic.</p>
<p>It has also found applications in the cosmetic industry due to its essential oils, which are used in aromatherapy and perfumery. Culturally, it is associated with healing and protection, often symbolizing resilience and strength in various traditions. In some regions, it is used in culinary practices, though more commonly in herbal teas and infusions.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in arid environments makes it valuable for ecological restoration and land stabilization projects.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea tournefortii has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Purpurea' and 'Lambertiana,' which are known for their striking purple and silver foliage, respectively.
