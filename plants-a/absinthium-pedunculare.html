                        <h1>Absinthium pedunculare</h1>
<p>Absinthium pedunculare, commonly known as the clustered wormwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small yellowish to brownish clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny environments. Its slender, branching stems are often covered in fine, hairy foliage.</p>
<p>The small, inconspicuous flowers give way to small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Absinthium pedunculare is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, often found in mountainous areas and along coastal regions. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides. Its distribution extends into western Asia, particularly in countries such as Turkey and Iran.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Absinthium pedunculare was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers and drought-tolerant nature.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the western United States. The plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to its classification as an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it can outcompete native vegetation and is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
