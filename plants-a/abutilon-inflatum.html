                <h1>Abutilon inflatum</h1>
<p>Abutilon inflatum, commonly known as the Indian velvet tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its velvety, hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>The species is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon inflatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly pubescent surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly woody with age. Its flowers are showy, with five petals that are typically yellow or orange, and they bloom in the summer months, relying on insect pollination, particularly by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon inflatum is a flowering plant native to the tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Central America and the Caribbean, where it has been introduced as an ornamental species. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forest understories, along stream banks, and in disturbed habitats. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Despite its widespread distribution, Abutilon inflatum is considered to be of low conservation concern due to its adaptability and limited threats in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon inflatum is a fast-growing, ornamental shrub known for its vibrant, papery flowers and unique, maple-like leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desired traits. The plant has an annual growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and entering dormancy in winter, depending on the climate.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abutilon inflatum is a flowering plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, orange flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of nearby species through mutual benefits. Its extensive root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Abutilon inflatum is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications.</p>
