<p>Amydrium zippelianum, commonly known as the Zippel's amydrium, is a rare and unique member of the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
