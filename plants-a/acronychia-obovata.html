                <h1>Acronychia obovata</h1>
<p>Acronychia obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed acronychia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its thick, leathery, obovate leaves that are often adorned with raised veins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It is typically found in coastal and lowland rainforest habitats, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia obovata has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grey to brown in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a dense, compact form. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white or pale yellow petals, and they bloom during the wet season, likely pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and helping it withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia obovata is primarily native to the northern regions of Australia, including the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical rainforests, as well as in coastal and inland areas. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with lowland and hill forest habitats. It is known for its distinctive obovate leaves and is an important component of the local flora.</p>
<p>Acronychia obovata is also found in some parts of New Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia obovata was mainly introduced to urban and coastal areas for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped environments where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is particularly valued for its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate saline and coastal conditions. It has been widely cultivated in regions with a warm climate, including parts of southern Australia and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
