                    <h1>Agrostophyllum curvum</h1>
<p>Agrostophyllum curvum, commonly known as the curved leaved lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically green to yellowish in color and has a distinct, wrinkled appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive on tree bark and rock surfaces. It is often found in temperate and tropical regions, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
