                <h1>Acer × guyotii</h1>
<p>Acer × guyotii, commonly known as the Vancouver maple, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Acer macrophyllum and Acer palmatum, resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The tree typically grows to a height of 8–15 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, light gray bark. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a vibrant green color that turns brilliant red or orange in the fall.</p>
<p>The Vancouver maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × guyotii has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobes, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes furrowed with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × guyotii is a hybrid maple species native to the mountainous regions of China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>Although it was originally native to these areas, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including North America and Europe, where it is often grown as an ornamental plant. It thrives in temperate climates with moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in forested areas or along stream sides. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters, where it benefits from cool, humid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and the threats from habitat loss, Acer × guyotii is considered to be of conservation concern in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × guyotii is a hybrid maple tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring stratification for germination. The growth cycle of Acer × guyotii involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer × guyotii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
