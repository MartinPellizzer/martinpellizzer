                    <h1>Allium sessiliflorum</h1>
<p>Allium sessiliflorum, commonly known as the purple garlic or Spanish garlic, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, violet to purple flowers on short, leafless stalks. The plant is characterized by its strong, pungent aroma, similar to that of garlic, which comes from sulfur compounds in its leaves and bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Allium sessiliflorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
