                <h1>Achimenes viscida</h1>
<p>Achimenes viscida, commonly known as the sticky achimenes, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture, which helps in deterring herbivores. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Achimenes viscida is typically grown as an annual or tender perennial, requiring well-drained soil and partial shade for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes viscida has heart-shaped, glossy, and dark green leaves that are alternate in arrangement and typically measure around 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>Its stems are upright, slightly hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. The flowers are showy, trumpet-shaped, and come in shades of red, pink, or white, blooming from summer to autumn and being pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant store nutrients and survive periods of drought.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes viscida is primarily native to tropical regions of South America, including countries such as Brazil, Peru, and Colombia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the understory of rainforests. This species is commonly found in areas with high rainfall and well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be seen growing along riverbanks and in secondary forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in some parts of the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes viscida was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses in countries such as the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with high humidity and well-draining soil, making it popular among horticulturists. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, where it can sometimes become invasive.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, proper management is necessary to prevent it from outcompeting native species.</p>
