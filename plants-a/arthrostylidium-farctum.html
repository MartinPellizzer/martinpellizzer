<p>Arthrostylidium farctum, commonly known as the fat-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically greenish-white with a strong scent. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to absorb water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Arthrostylidium farctum plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree health and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
