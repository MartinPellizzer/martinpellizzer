                <h1>Adenosma ovata</h1>
<p>Adenosma ovata, commonly known as the oval leaf adenosma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Adenosma ovata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma ovata has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a pale green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma ovata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant is commonly associated with lowland evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. It is also present in parts of India and the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>Adenosma ovata is well adapted to humid climates and is often used in traditional medicine in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma ovata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an environmental weed that spreads rapidly in disturbed areas. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and can form dense stands. It competes with native vegetation, leading to a decline in biodiversity.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and prevent further invasion of natural habitats.</p>
