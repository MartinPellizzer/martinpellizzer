                <h1>Acer campbellii subsp. chekiangense</h1>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>chekiangense, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The tree typically grows to a height of 8â€“12 meters and features smooth, gray bark with vertical fissures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to a range of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>chekiangense has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and grows upright, with smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with yellowish-green sepals and red stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a paired samara, each winged seed dispersing by wind after maturation in late summer.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>chekiangense is a rare maple species native to China, specifically found in the Zhejiang province. While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to a few isolated populations in the eastern part of China.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, temperate forests with well-drained soil and partial shade. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>chekiangense is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and compact size, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period to break dormancy.</p>
<p>This species has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil with consistent moisture. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>chekiangense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring blossoms and provides nectar and pollen.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of flora and fauna. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through its photosynthetic processes.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>chekiangense is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>The tree contributes to local economies through timber and ornamental horticulture, making it valuable in the forestry and landscaping industries. Culturally, it holds symbolic importance in Chinese botany and is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and public spaces.</p>
<p>Its role in biodiversity conservation also highlights its ecological applications in maintaining forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>chekiangense has several popular cultivars such as 'Red Dragon' and 'Orange Crown', which are prized for their vibrant autumn color and compact growth. It is also used in hybridization to create new maple varieties with enhanced ornamental traits.</p>
<p>Hybrid forms often combine the hardiness of Acer campbellii with the color variability of other maple species. These hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their adaptability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Overall, the species plays an important role in landscape design due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
