                    <h1>Acmispon tomentosus var. glabriusculus</h1>
<p>Acmispon tomentosus var. glabriusculus, commonly known as the woolly burr medick, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It has small, trifoliate leaves with a dense, woolly covering that helps retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an important species in ecological studies of desert ecosystems.</p>
