                <h1>Adiantum capillus-veneris</h1>
<p>Adiantum capillus-veneris, commonly known as the "Maiden's Hair Fern," is a delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, silky fronds that give it a feathery appearance, with each leaflet being narrow and tapering. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and has a preference for well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in various cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum capillus-veneris has delicate, finely divided leaves that are bi- or tri-pinnate, giving them a feathery appearance, with a bright green color and a wavy margin.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, creeping, and often hairy, with a light green to yellowish bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a dark brown, globose achene, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are tiny with a tuft of hair for aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum capillus-veneris was mainly introduced to Austria, Belgium, Czechia-Slovakia, Germany, and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its delicate, fern-like appearance. Its introduction to these regions is largely attributed to horticultural trade and garden cultivation.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
