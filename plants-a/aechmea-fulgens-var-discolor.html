                    <h1>Aechmea fulgens var. discolor</h1>
<p>Aechmea fulgens var. discolor, commonly known as the Red-tipped Pineapple Plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround a central spadix, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central cup used for storing rainwater. Its flowers are typically small and green, emerging from the base of the rosette.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in bright, indirect light and its relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
