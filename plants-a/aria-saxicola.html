                    <h1>Aria saxicola</h1>
<p>Aria saxicola, commonly known as the rock aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions, with small, hairy leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, showy blue to purple flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in rocky environments, making it an important species in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Aria saxicola is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
