                <h1>Aegiphila nuxia</h1>
<p>Aegiphila nuxia, commonly known as the Brazilian thyme, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant leaves and clusters of purple or pink flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Aegiphila nuxia is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila nuxia has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with a rough, grayish bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
