                <h1>Aegilops triuncialis</h1>
<p>Aegilops triuncialis, commonly known as the wild wheat or goat grass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish florets. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Aegilops triuncialis has historical significance in the domestication of wheat and is considered a close relative of modern wheat species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops triuncialis has alternate, narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color, with a linear shape and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are spike-like, composed of small, greenish-white florets, and bloom in early summer; they are primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a caryopsis, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
