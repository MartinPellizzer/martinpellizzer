                    <h1>Acacia cooleyi</h1>
<p>Acacia cooleyi, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and feathery, bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, globular spikes, which bloom in spring and attract a variety of pollinators. Acacia cooleyi is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
