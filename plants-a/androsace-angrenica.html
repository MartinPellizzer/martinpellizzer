                    <h1>Androsace angrenica</h1>
<p>Androsace angrenica, commonly known as the Karakorum sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
