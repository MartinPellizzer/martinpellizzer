<p>Andropogon spathaceus, commonly known as flatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland areas, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often surrounded by a leaf-like bract. Its flowering period usually occurs in the summer months, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat preferences, it is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
