                <h1>Adnaria vauthieri</h1>
<p>Adnaria vauthieri, commonly known as the Vauthier's spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth or slightly toothed margin.</p>
<p>Adnaria vauthieri is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria vauthieri has leaves that are alternate, simple, and ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, have five petals, and bloom in early spring, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria vauthieri is primarily native to the Mediterranean Basin, specifically the coastal regions of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and saline environments, often found along the shores of countries such as France, Italy, Spain, and Tunisia. The plant is well adapted to the harsh conditions of coastal habitats, including high salinity and exposure to strong winds. It is commonly associated with maritime cliffs and limestone formations.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the western and central Mediterranean, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria vauthieri was mainly introduced to coastal and estuarine environments in southern Europe, particularly in France and Italy.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish waters and is commonly found in intertidal zones with muddy or sandy substrates. This plant is often associated with eutrophication and can form dense mats that alter local ecosystems. Its introduction has been linked to human activities such as coastal development and the discharge of nutrient-rich runoff.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
