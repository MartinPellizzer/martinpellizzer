                <h1>Adonis parviflora</h1>
<p>Adonis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered adonis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis parviflora has simple, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped, with a bluish-green color and a smooth texture, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, with five petals and a short tube, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis parviflora is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and southern Russia.</p>
<p>It is also found in the western regions of China, particularly in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region. This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly slopes at high altitudes, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its natural range extends into the Tibetan Plateau, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Adonis parviflora is commonly associated with alpine meadows and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis parviflora was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates, including parts of Europe, North America, and the Middle East. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of environments. It is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to naturalize.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
