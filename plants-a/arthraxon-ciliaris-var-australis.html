<p>Arthraxon ciliaris var. australis, commonly known as the Australian flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, often nutrient-rich soils. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. It is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to seasonal flooding.</p>
