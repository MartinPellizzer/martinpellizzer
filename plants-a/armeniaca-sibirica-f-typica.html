<p>Armeniaca sibirica f. typica, commonly known as the Siberian apricot, is a botanical variant of the apricot species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, temperate climates and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly serrated edge, and it produces fragrant white flowers in spring.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in culinary applications due to the tartness of its fruit.</p>
