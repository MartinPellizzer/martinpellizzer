                <h1>Aegiphila lopez-palacii</h1>
<p>Aegiphila lopez-palacii, commonly known as the Lopez-Palaci fern, is a rare shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a silvery underside, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of purple or pink.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila lopez-palacii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered with a rough, bark-like texture, and has a reddish-brown color, growing upright with some branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid environment where the plant typically grows.</p>
