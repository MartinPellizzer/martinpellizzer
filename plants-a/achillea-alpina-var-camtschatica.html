                <h1>Achillea alpina var. camtschatica</h1>
<p>Achillea alpina var. camtschatica, commonly known as the Siberian yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Siberia and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, slender stems that bear narrow, gray-green leaves with a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. camtschatica has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 5–10 cm long and 0.5–1 cm wide.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. The flowers are clustered in flat-topped umbels, consisting of small, white to pale yellow ray florets surrounded by yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, dispersing by wind after maturation.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish in rocky or alpine soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. camtschatica is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across the high-altitude areas of the Caucasus, including countries like Russia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is commonly found in alpine meadows and slopes. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of concern and is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. camtschatica is a hardy perennial known for its finely divided, fern-like foliage and delicate white to pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a summer growth cycle, producing flowers in mid to late summer and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilize lightly in early spring, and prune spent flower stalks after blooming to encourage compact growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. camtschatica is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on it for food and shelter. This plant acts as a companion plant in alpine ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that holds soil in place.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological balance by improving soil structure and supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna.</p>
