                    <h1>Ammobium alatum</h1>
<p>Ammobium alatum, commonly known as the winged sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its unique, wing-like structures on the stems are adaptations to reduce water loss and enhance wind dispersal of seeds.</p>
<p>Ammobium alatum is well-suited to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
