                <h1>Adelia ferruginea</h1>
<p>Adelia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty adelia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish-brown coloration on the underside. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Adelia ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia ferruginea has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often reddish underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The stem is slender, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellow petals and a greenish center, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia ferruginea is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in areas such as KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape, and parts of the Free State. This plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is commonly associated with coastal and inland forests. It is often found in moist, shaded environments, typically near rivers or in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Adelia ferruginea is an important component of the local flora, contributing to biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia ferruginea was mainly introduced to the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fern-like foliage. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in coastal rainforests. It has become naturalized in several regions, spreading through seed dispersal by water and wind.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
