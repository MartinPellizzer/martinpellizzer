                <h1>Acinodendron corallinum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron corallinum, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking clusters of bright red or orange flowers that resemble coral, hence its common name. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a feather-like pattern. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas or near riverbanks.</p>
<p>Acinodendron corallinum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron corallinum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring approximately 2â€“4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that exfoliates as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron corallinum is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments within forests and along stream banks. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often associated with rocky or clayey substrates in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Acinodendron corallinum plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron corallinum was mainly introduced to specific regions with suitable climate conditions, such as tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats, including roadsides and abandoned fields. This plant has shown a tendency to spread rapidly in these environments due to its adaptability. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>However, more research is needed to fully understand its ecological effects.</p>
