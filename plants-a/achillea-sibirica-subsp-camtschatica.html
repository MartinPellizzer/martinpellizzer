<p>Achillea sibirica subsp.</p>
<p>camtschatica, commonly known as Siberian yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It features wiry, upright stems and basal leaves that are gray-green and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sibirica subsp.</p>
<p>camtschatica has basal leaves that are lanceolate to elliptic in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray underside and a dark green upper surface. The stem is upright, hairy, and becomes woody with age, displaying a grayish-green color.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow and consist of a central disk surrounded by ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cypsela, which is dispersed by wind due to its pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, aiding in the plant's ability to thrive in dry, rocky environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sibirica subsp.</p>
<p>camtschatica is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Siberia and the Far East of Russia. Its current distribution includes parts of Mongolia and northern China, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and rocky slopes. It grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The conservation status of this plant is currently listed as least concern, though it remains vulnerable to habitat degradation and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea sibirica subsp.</p>
<p>camtschatica is a hardy perennial known for its attractive, feathery yellow flowers and drought tolerance. It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the root clumps in early spring. This plant has a cold-hardy growth cycle, thriving in USDA zones 3-7, with a dormant period in winter and active growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and minimal watering, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or chamomile can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
