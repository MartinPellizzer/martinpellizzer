                <h1>Acer pseudoplatanus f. discolor</h1>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. discolor, commonly known as the white-veined maple, is a variant of the common maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive white veins on otherwise green leaves, which stand out vividly against the foliage. The plant is a deciduous tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of 5 to 10 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed and turn yellow in the autumn, adding ornamental value to the landscape.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. discolor has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–8 cm in length, with a distinctive variegated pattern of white and green on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and light gray, with a straight growth pattern, and the bark remains smooth even as the tree matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. discolor is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the Pyrenees Mountains in southern France.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited to this region, it is now found in botanical gardens and conservation collections worldwide. This form thrives in temperate climates with moist, well-drained soils, typically in woodlands or along stream banks. It is usually found at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and restricted natural habitat, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. discolor is a striking ornamental maple known for its variegated foliage and compact growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings in summer or by seed, though cuttings yield more consistent results. This shade-tolerant plant grows slowly, reaching maturity in 5–10 years, with a growth cycle that includes active growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, moist soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and promote air circulation. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or hostas enhances its aesthetic appeal in shaded garden settings.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. discolor is a decorative tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the aesthetic value of the landscape. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna.</p>
