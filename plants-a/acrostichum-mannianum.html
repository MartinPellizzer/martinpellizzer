                <h1>Acrostichum mannianum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum mannianum, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The fronds are divided into small, finger-like segments that aid in photosynthesis and gas exchange.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum mannianum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 2 meters in length, with a deep green color and a smooth upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and erect, with a rough, fibrous bark that is brown in color, and it exhibits a vertical growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the wet season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a globose drupe that contains a single seed, dispersed by wind due to its feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and anchor itself in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum mannianum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove forests, and along riverbanks where it thrives in moist, saline environments. This plant is also present in parts of New Guinea and the western Pacific Islands. It prefers sandy or muddy soils and is often associated with brackish water habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum mannianum was mainly introduced to areas with humid climates and disturbed soils, often as an ornamental or for erosion control.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments. This plant has been reported in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas. Its introduction has sometimes led to its establishment in native ecosystems, raising concerns about its invasive potential.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread in non-native habitats.</p>
