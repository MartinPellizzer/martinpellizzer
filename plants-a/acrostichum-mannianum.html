<p>Acrostichum mannianum, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The fronds are divided into small, finger-like segments that aid in photosynthesis and gas exchange.</p>
