                <h1>Adenotrichia amplexicaulis</h1>
<p>Adenotrichia amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pinnulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant is characterized by its tightly clasping stems that encircle the stems of its host plants, giving it its common name. Its leaves are closely arranged and often appear in a dense, cushion-like structure.</p>
<p>Adenotrichia amplexicaulis plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides microhabitat for various small organisms in its ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenotrichia amplexicaulis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenotrichia amplexicaulis is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Oklahoma.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, sandy soils in open woodlands and along roadsides. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed areas. It is also known to occur in parts of New Mexico and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with limestone soils and rocky habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenotrichia amplexicaulis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. However, it has since become a weed in certain areas, posing a threat to native ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and spreads rapidly through its rhizomes.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to increased management efforts to control its spread.</p>
