                    <h1>Aeschynomene natans</h1>
<p>Aeschynomene natans, commonly known as floating bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating, leaf-like structures that contain specialized air-filled sacs, allowing it to remain buoyant on the water's surface. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne on short stalks above the water. Its leaves are often divided into narrow segments, and it can form dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving water bodies.</p>
<p>Aeschynomene natans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water oxygenation.</p>
