<p>Adonanthe sibirica, commonly known as Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy and slightly woody at the base.</p>
<p>Adonanthe sibirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, colorful blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonanthe sibirica has leaves that are simple, alternate, and elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; they are typically 5-10 cm long and 2-4 cm wide.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and has a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with few branches.
