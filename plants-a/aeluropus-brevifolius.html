                <h1>Aeluropus brevifolius</h1>
<p>Aeluropus brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure. The plant has narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Aeluropus brevifolius is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus brevifolius has grass-like leaves that are narrow, linear, and slightly curled, arranged in a basal rosette with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stout, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright from the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters, typically yellow or green, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-lobed spikelet containing three small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the soil and absorb water efficiently.</p>
