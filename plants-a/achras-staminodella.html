                <h1>Achras staminodella</h1>
<p>Achras staminodella, commonly known as the red-fruit achiote, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into orange-red, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. Its fruit is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural dye due to its rich pigment content.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is well adapted to coastal and lowland environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras staminodella has palmate leaves that are large, broad, and deeply lobed, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unbranched. The flowers are clustered in large, showy inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a large, fleshy drupe that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by animals feeding on the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras staminodella is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America, such as Belize and northern Honduras. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with warm climates and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends to some islands in the Lesser Antilles as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras staminodella was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and rapid growth.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there by humans for its aesthetic value, although its introduction was unintentional in some cases. The plant has since spread beyond cultivation and is now considered an invasive species in several regions. It thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns.</p>
<p>Its distribution highlights the challenges of managing non-native species in island ecosystems.</p>
