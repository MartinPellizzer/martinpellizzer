<p>Alsophila insulana, commonly known as the island tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds.
