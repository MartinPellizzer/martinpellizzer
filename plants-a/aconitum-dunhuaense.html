                <h1>Aconitum dunhuaense</h1>
<p>Aconitum dunhuaense, commonly known as the Dunhua monkshood, is a perennial herb native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple spurred flowers. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum dunhuaense has palmately compound leaves that are broadly ovate to reniform in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing upright and reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The flowers are showy and blue-violet in color, arranged in dense terminal panicles, with spurred petals and a nectar-rich center, blooming in late summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients for winter dormancy.</p>
