                    <h1>Arenaria arenaria</h1>
<p>Arenaria arenaria, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous or coastal areas. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, aiding in its spread across open habitats.</p>
