The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat in remote mountainous regions, it is relatively rare and faces threats from climate change and habitat degradation.</p>
