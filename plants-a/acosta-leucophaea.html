                <h1>Acosta leucophaea</h1>
<p>Acosta leucophaea, commonly known as the white-leaf acosta, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentamerous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or along streambanks. Its leaves are large, ovate, and covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Acosta leucophaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage and floral displays.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta leucophaea has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a glossy green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta leucophaea is primarily native to South America, specifically the Andean regions of Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It is found in high-altitude environments, typically in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. This plant thrives in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soils. It is often associated with rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas within the Andes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta leucophaea was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along utility lines.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in temperate and subtropical regions. This plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has been reported in several countries, including the United States, Mexico, and parts of South America.</p>
<p>Its introduction is largely attributed to human activity, such as landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
