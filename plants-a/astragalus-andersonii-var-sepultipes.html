<p>Astragalus andersonii var. sepultipes, commonly known as the Anderson's milkvetch, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Mojave Desert.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial forb with yellow flowers and hairy stems, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in creosote bush and blackbrush communities.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
