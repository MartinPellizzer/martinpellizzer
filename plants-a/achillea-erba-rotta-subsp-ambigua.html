<p>Achillea erba-rotta subsp.</p>
<p>ambigua, commonly known as the alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat, clustered flower heads.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high elevations with full sun exposure. Its flowers, which range from white to pale yellow, bloom in late summer and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta subsp.</p>
<p>ambigua has basal, linear to lanceolate leaves that are typically grey-green in color, arranged in a rosette, and can grow up to 10 cm in length. The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing from the base to form a flowering scapes.</p>
<p>The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, cylindrical achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta subsp.</p>
<p>ambigua is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains. Its current distribution extends across parts of Central and Eastern Europe, including countries like Italy, Austria, and Romania.</p>
<p>This species thrives in open, rocky, or gravelly slopes, often in sunny, well-drained environments. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
