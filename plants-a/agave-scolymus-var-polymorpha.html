                    <h1>Agave scolymus var. polymorpha</h1>
<p>Agave scolymus var. polymorpha, commonly known as the Variegated Century Plant, is a striking succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green with white or yellow variegation. The leaves are lined with sharp, spiny margins and have a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which appear after several years.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for arid climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
