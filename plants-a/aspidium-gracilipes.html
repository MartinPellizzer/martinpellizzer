<p>Aspidium gracilipes, commonly known as the slender spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has thin, delicate fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length, with a lanceolate shape and a smooth, glossy surface. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Aspidium gracilipes is often found in temperate regions and is characterized by its simple, non-branching fronds.</p>
