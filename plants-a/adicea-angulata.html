                <h1>Adicea angulata</h1>
<p>Adicea angulata, commonly known as the angular adicea, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like species. The plant is characterized by its angular, ribbed stems and opposite leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, with five petals and a prominent corona.</p>
<p>Adicea angulata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea angulata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 3 to 8 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows in a climbing or trailing pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea angulata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Adicea angulata is also used traditionally in some African communities for medicinal purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea angulata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads rapidly through its rhizomes.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local biodiversity.</p>
