                    <h1>Athyrium × lobulosoimpolitum</h1>
<p>Athyrium × lobulosoimpolitum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium lobulosum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and gold. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense mats over time.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
