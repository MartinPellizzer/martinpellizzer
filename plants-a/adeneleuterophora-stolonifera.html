                <h1>Adeneleuterophora stolonifera</h1>
<p>Adeneleuterophora stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous adeneleuterophora, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form new plants. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Adeneleuterophora stolonifera is often found in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adeneleuterophora stolonifera has leaves that are oval-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and slightly serrated edges.</p>
<p>Its stems are slender, creeping, and produce a smooth, light green bark that allows for horizontal growth along the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with four petals, typically in shades of pink or white, blooming in late spring and early summer, and they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adeneleuterophora stolonifera is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the coastal regions of South Carolina and Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This plant is commonly found in dune environments and other coastal habitats where it can tolerate salt spray and shifting sands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the specific environmental conditions of the southeastern coastal plains.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adeneleuterophora stolonifera was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common invader in degraded landscapes. This plant spreads primarily through stolons, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly. Its introduction has been documented in several regions, including parts of the southern United States and Australia.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can outcompete native species and alter local ecosystems.</p>
