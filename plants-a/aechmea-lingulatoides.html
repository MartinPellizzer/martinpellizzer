The plant features a central stem that produces striking, spadix-like flowers, often in shades of red or orange. Its foliage is typically covered in a silvery or white powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Aechmea lingulatoides thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
