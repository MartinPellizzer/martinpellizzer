<p>Acalypha cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Acalypha cuneata is also noted for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its use in ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha cuneata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 3 to 8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-winged samara, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a shallow network, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha cuneata is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth, typically at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from habitat destruction, it is classified as a species of concern in some areas, though its conservation status varies by region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha cuneata is a vibrant, fast-growing shrub known for its colorful foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick results. The growth cycle of Acalypha cuneata is typically rapid, with new shoots emerging throughout the growing season, making it ideal for gardeners seeking quick visual impact.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season promotes lush growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourages bushier foliage. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
