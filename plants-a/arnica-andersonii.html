<p>Arnica andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's Arnica, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces small, spiny fruits called cypsela, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Arnica andersonii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
