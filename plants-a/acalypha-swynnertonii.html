                        <h1>Acalypha swynnertonii</h1>
<p>Acalypha swynnertonii, commonly known as the Swynnerton's spurge, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha swynnertonii is primarily native to eastern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist forested areas and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often associated with secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of southern Arabia and the Horn of Africa.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these regions, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha swynnertonii was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the eastern regions, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several provinces including KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, and Mpumalanga. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in urban environments where it can thrive in a variety of soil types. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to its establishment in natural habitats.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
