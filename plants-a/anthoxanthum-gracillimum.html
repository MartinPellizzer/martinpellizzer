The plant produces pale yellow to golden florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
