                    <h1>Asplenium × chasei</h1>
<p>Asplenium × chasei, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its leaves, which are usually covered in a layer of small, spore-producing structures called sorangia.</p>
<p>Asplenium × chasei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
