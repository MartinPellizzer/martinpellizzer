                <h1>Adonis abortiva</h1>
<p>Adonis abortiva, commonly known as the meadow buttercup, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow, cup-shaped flowers and basal leaves with lobed margins. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adonis abortiva is often found in disturbed areas and can spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis abortiva has alternate, basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a bluish-green color and a hairy surface, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, often branching, with a smooth, light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are solitary, with a yellowish-green corolla and prominent purple-blue petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their small, winged structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky, arid habitats where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis abortiva is primarily native to the mountainous regions of the western United States, including California, Nevada, and Utah.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky soils at high elevations. This species is also native to parts of western Canada, such as British Columbia and Alberta. It prefers well-drained soils and is commonly found in open areas such as meadows and slopes.</p>
<p>Adonis abortiva is an important part of the local flora and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis abortiva was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste areas, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to low precipitation and well-drained soils. This plant has become naturalized in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. Its introduction is often associated with human activities like landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it can sometimes outcompete native vegetation in invaded areas.</p>
