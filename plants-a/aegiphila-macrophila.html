                <h1>Aegiphila macrophila</h1>
<p>Aegiphila macrophila, commonly known as the large-leaved aegiphila, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Aegiphila macrophila is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila macrophila has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and cylindrical, with a rough, greyish bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring small, white to pale pink petals, and bloom during the dry season, relying on wind pollination for reproduction. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
