                        <h1>Acacia hockii</h1>
<p>Acacia hockii, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. Acacia hockii is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is the national floral emblem of Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia hockii is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland areas, often growing in disturbed or secondary forests, as well as along roadsides and in open woodlands. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils and is often associated with coastal or riverine environments. It is also present in parts of northern Australia, where it has been introduced and naturalized.</p>
<p>Acacia hockii is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and its ability to form dense thickets, making it an important component of the local flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia hockii was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various soil conditions.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivation and is now considered a weed in some regions, particularly in coastal and urban areas. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites, making it a potential ecological threat. Its introduction has led to management efforts to control its spread in natural habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential, Acacia hockii remains popular in horticulture for its aesthetic value.</p>
