                <h1>Ada euodes</h1>
<p>Ada euodes, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Ada euodes has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green bark that becomes rough and fissured with age. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, featuring white petals with a yellow center, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Ada euodes is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing near rivers or in shaded undergrowth. It is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, its natural range is limited to specific habitats within its native region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Ada euodes was mainly introduced to control invasive vegetation in wetland areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant thrives in moist to wet conditions, making it suitable for riparian zones and marshy environments. It has been successfully introduced in several regions across North America and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>However, its spread requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive itself.</p>
