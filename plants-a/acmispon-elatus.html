                <h1>Acmispon elatus</h1>
<p>Acmispon elatus, commonly known as the silverleaf cosmos, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its silvery foliage and drought tolerance contribute to its ornamental value in arid landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmispon elatus has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody at the base, and has a rough, bark-like texture, growing upright with a spreading habit. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and deep, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon elatus is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and parts of California. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is particularly adapted to dry climates and is often seen in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Acmispon elatus is also known as the desert larkspur and is a member of the Fabaceae family.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon elatus was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant spreads rapidly through its extensive root system, making it effective for land rehabilitation. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its introduction has had both positive and negative ecological impacts depending on the region.</p>
