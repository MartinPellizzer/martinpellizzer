                <h1>Acer parviflorum</h1>
<p>Acer parviflorum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 meters, with a broad, rounded canopy. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The tree prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental species in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer parviflorum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes furrowed with age, and it exhibits a vertical growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with a delicate yellowish-green color, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and wing structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer parviflorum is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited, with populations found primarily in specific regions of China. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in mixed forests or on rocky slopes. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer parviflorum is considered a species of concern and is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer parviflorum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle involves rapid growth in spring and summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may face issues with scale insects or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with flowering shrubs and perennials for aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer parviflorum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring blossoms. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil health. Its shallow root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving air quality and offering aesthetic value to natural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer parviflorum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value, often planted in gardens and parks for its attractive foliage and autumn colors.</p>
<p>While not commonly used in culinary applications, its flowers have been occasionally used in traditional teas. In medicinal practices, it has been explored for its potential anti-inflammatory properties, though research is limited. Industrially, it contributes to the timber industry, providing wood for furniture and paper production.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in art and literature.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer parviflorum has a variety of cultivars, hybrids, and forms that contribute to its horticultural significance.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Summerglo' and 'Carnegie', which are prized for their vibrant fall colors and compact growth. Hybrids such as Acer parviflorum Ã— trichogineum have been developed to enhance ornamental features like leaf color and form. These varieties are valued in landscaping for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to different garden environments.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer parviflorum plays an important role in ornamental horticulture due to its diverse and visually striking characteristics.</p>
