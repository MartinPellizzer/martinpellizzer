                    <h1>Acacia cuthbertsonii</h1>
<p>Acacia cuthbertsonii, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in cylindrical spikes, which appear during the warmer months and attract a variety of pollinators. Its seeds are encased in hard pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>Acacia cuthbertsonii is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems along the coastline.</p>
