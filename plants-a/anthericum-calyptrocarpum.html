<p>Anthericum calyptrocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a thick, rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, swampy environments. The plant produces striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often variegated with silver or white markings. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe, typical of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>Anthericum calyptrocarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats.</p>
