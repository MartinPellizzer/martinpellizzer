                    <h1>Azolla guineensis</h1>
<p>Azolla guineensis, commonly known as the African water fern, is a small, floating aquatic fern belonging to the family Azollaceae.</p>
<p>It forms dense mats on the surface of freshwater bodies, contributing to nutrient cycling and oxygen production in aquatic ecosystems. The plant is characterized by its tiny, water-filled fronds and symbiotic nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria within its leaf cavities. Azolla guineensis thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in rice paddies and other slow-moving water environments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate makes it both a valuable biofertilizer and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
