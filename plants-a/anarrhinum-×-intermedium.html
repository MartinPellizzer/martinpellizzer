                    <h1>Anarrhinum × intermedium</h1>
<p>Anarrhinum × intermedium, commonly known as the hybrid tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between *Anarrhinum lindheimeri* and *Anarrhinum macrocarpum*, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is characterized by its dense, often spiny foliage and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by insects, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Anarrhinum × intermedium is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in riparian and desert ecosystems.</p>
