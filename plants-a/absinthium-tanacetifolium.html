                <h1>Absinthium tanacetifolium</h1>
<p>Absinthium tanacetifolium, commonly known as wormwood, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in tiny, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Native to Europe and western Asia, it thrives in dry, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Its chemical composition includes volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its distinctive aroma and historical use in medicine and distillation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Absinthium tanacetifolium has compound, finely divided leaves that are narrow and linear, arranged in a basal rosette, with a silvery-gray underside due to dense pubescence.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, slender, and covered with fine hairs, and it has a pale greenish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in flat-topped umbels, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersing via wind, and the seeds are minute and numerous.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Absinthium tanacetifolium is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, including countries such as Spain, France, and Italy.</p>
<p>It is now found in parts of North Africa and the Middle East as well, having been introduced to these areas. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though local populations may be threatened by habitat loss and land-use changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Absinthium tanacetifolium is a hardy perennial herb known for its aromatic leaves and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing mature plants in early spring. The growth cycle begins with germination in spring, followed by rapid growth and flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced mix in early spring and regular pruning to encourage bushiness are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>
