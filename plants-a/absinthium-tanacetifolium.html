<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Absinthium tanacetifolium is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, and France.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is commonly found in rocky soils and open woodlands. This plant is also present in parts of North Africa, including Morocco and Algeria, where it adapts well to the arid climate. It is often seen in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas.</p>
<p>Its historical use in herbal medicine and as a component in absinthe has contributed to its recognition in traditional botanical practices.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Absinthium tanacetifolium was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its showy yellow flowers and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated gardens into natural areas, particularly in disturbed soils and open habitats. This plant is considered invasive in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about ecological impact and habitat alteration.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to control its spread and mitigate its effects on local ecosystems.</p>
