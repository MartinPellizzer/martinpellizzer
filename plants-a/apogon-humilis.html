                    <h1>Apogon humilis</h1>
<p>Apogon humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sea horse plant, is a unique aquatic plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish water environments, often found in estuaries and tidal zones. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its delicate, horse-tail-like stems and small, clustered flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapting to the fluctuating salinity and water levels of its habitat.</p>
<p>Apogon humilis plays an important role in stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
