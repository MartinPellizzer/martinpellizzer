                    <h1>Agrostis humbertii var. mandrarensis</h1>
<p>Agrostis humbertii var. mandrarensis, commonly known as the Mandrarensis bentgrass, is a rare and endemic grass species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This variety is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features include small, spike-like inflorescences and tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for ecological and conservation studies.</p>
