<p>Aethionema saxatile subsp.</p>
<p>latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the rocky regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats, with small, fleshy leaves adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in spring, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent foliage and compact growth habit make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Aethionema saxatile.</p>
