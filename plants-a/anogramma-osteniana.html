<p>Anogramma osteniana, commonly known as the Ostenian maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble those of the more widely known maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of its fertile fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Anogramma osteniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
