                <h1>Achillea pumila</h1>
<p>Achillea pumila, commonly known as the lesser yarrow, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, leafy stems that arise from a central rosette. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs. Its leaves are finely divided, grass-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Achillea pumila is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in sunny, arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pumila has small, gray-green, spoon-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem and are covered in a fine, woolly layer.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a pale green color, growing in a丛生 pattern. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and form flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pumila is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the Pacific coast. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often seen in dunes and open grasslands. It is also native to parts of Baja California in Mexico.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pumila was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils. This plant is often considered an invasive species in some parts of the world due to its rapid spread. It has been reported in several European countries and has also been introduced to North America.</p>
<p>Its distribution is expanding due to human activities and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
