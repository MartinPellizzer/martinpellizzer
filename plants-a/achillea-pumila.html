                <h1>Achillea pumila</h1>
<p>Achillea pumila, commonly known as the cushion yarrow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>Achillea pumila is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pumila has leaves that are spoon-shaped (spatulate), arranged in a basal rosette, with a blue-gray upper surface and a white underside, and they are relatively small, measuring up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green color, growing from the base of the plant with a compact growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white to pale yellow petals and a yellow center, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pumila is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Its current distribution extends to temperate regions of the United States, particularly in the western states like California and Oregon. It thrives in dry, rocky, and sandy soils, often found in open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and coastal areas. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Achillea pumila is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea pumila is a low-growing perennial herb commonly known as the lesser yarrow, prized for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with division being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, typically blooming in early to mid-summer and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering. Fertilization should be light, applied in spring, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea pumila is a low-growing flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, which rely on its flowers and seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as an effective companion plant, often growing alongside other herbs and shrubs to enhance biodiversity in gardens and natural habitats. Its dense growth pattern also helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in disturbed or marginal areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea pumila contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea pumila is a flowering plant known for its medicinal properties, often used in traditional medicine to treat ailments such as digestive issues and skin conditions.</p>
<p>It has also been utilized in culinary applications, with its flowers sometimes added to herbal teas or used as a flavoring agent.
