<p>Arabis hirsuta var. pumila, commonly known as the downy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, branched stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover.</p>
