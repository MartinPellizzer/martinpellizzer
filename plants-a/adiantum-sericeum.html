<p>Adiantum sericeum, commonly known as the silky maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in a silvery, silky coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to regions of eastern North America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant's fronds are typically biannual, with new growth emerging from the base each year.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
