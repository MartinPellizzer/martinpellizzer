                <h1>Actinidia glabra</h1>
<p>Actinidia glabra, commonly known as the fuzzy actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, fragrant berries that ripen in late summer. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are often used in juices and wines.</p>
<p>Actinidia glabra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia glabra has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows as a climbing or trailing vine. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, yellowish berry that matures in late summer, and it is dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia glabra is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Hubei, Sichuan, and Yunnan.</p>
<p>It grows in temperate forest regions at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. This plant is commonly found in moist, shaded areas along streams and in mountainous terrain. It is a woody vine that thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Actinidia glabra is known for its edible fruits and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia glabra was mainly introduced to North America and Europe as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for fruit production.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has also been cultivated for its edible berries, which are used in teas and traditional medicine. However, it has shown invasive tendencies in some regions, outcompeting native species.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to control its spread and minimize ecological impact.</p>
