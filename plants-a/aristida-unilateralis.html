                    <h1>Aristida unilateralis</h1>
<p>Aristida unilateralis, commonly known as the single-sided grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with bracts, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in regions with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, Aristida unilateralis is sometimes used in landscaping and for erosion control in dry climates.</p>
