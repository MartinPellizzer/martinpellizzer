                    <h1>Alopecurus ventricosus var. lobatus</h1>
<p>Alopecurus ventricosus var. lobatus, commonly known as the hairy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive blue-green coloration, which is due to its high chlorophyll content. The plant has dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
