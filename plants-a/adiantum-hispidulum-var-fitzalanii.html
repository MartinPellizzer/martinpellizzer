<p>Adiantum hispidulum var. fitzalanii, commonly known as the Fitzalan's maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid indoor conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum hispidulum var. fitzalanii has fern-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a delicate frond arrangement, typically pinnately divided and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a bright green color, with a serrated margin and a glossy texture. The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a vertical pattern. This species does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-producing plant, and its reproductive structures are instead composed of sporangia on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the environment.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum hispidulum var. fitzalanii is a fern native to the eastern United States, specifically found in the Appalachian region.</p>
