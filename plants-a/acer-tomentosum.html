<p>Acer tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (fuzzy) pubescence on young stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are palmately lobed, typically with five to seven lobes, and turn vibrant yellow in the fall. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
