                <h1>Acer tomentosum</h1>
<p>Acer tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. It typically grows to a height of 10-20 meters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The woolly maple is valued for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tomentosum has leaves that are broadly ovate to rounded, with a serrated margin, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a pale, velvety underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tomentosum is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, specifically China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including North America and Europe, where it is grown for its ornamental value. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in temperate forests or along stream banks. It grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Acer tomentosum is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating that it is not facing significant threats in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tomentosum is a slow-growing, deciduous tree known for its dense, fuzzy foliage and vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for germination. The tree follows a typical temperate growth cycle, shedding leaves in autumn and entering dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs can enhance its ornamental value and support local pollinators.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tomentosum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and promoting the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer tomentosum contributes to carbon sequestration, playing a vital role in maintaining ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tomentosum is a species of maple known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its sap can be processed similarly to other maple syrups, though it is less common. In traditional medicine, the bark and leaves have been used to treat ailments such as coughs and skin conditions. Industrially, it contributes to local economies through timber and ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is valued as a symbol of resilience and beauty in various regions where it grows.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tomentosum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aconitifolium' and 'Barnesii', known for their distinctive foliage and vibrant autumn colors. Hybrids of Acer tomentosum are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and fall coloration. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in landscaping.</p>
<p>They are commonly used in gardens and parks to add visual interest throughout the growing season.</p>
