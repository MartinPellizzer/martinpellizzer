                <h1>Actinidia guilinensis</h1>
<p>Actinidia guilinensis, commonly known as Guilin kiwifruit, is a deciduous vine native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is closely related to the kiwifruit species. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically green and have a fuzzy skin. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>The botanical characteristics of Actinidia guilinensis make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia guilinensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, and a lighter green underside; they are arranged alternately along the stems and are typically 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and twining, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when mature, and it is dispersed by birds and animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, spreading out near the surface of the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia guilinensis is primarily native to the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in southern China.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of this area, particularly in the Guangxi and Guangdong provinces. This species thrives in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soil. It is commonly found in secondary forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes areas with mild winters and warm, wet summers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia guilinensis was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in eastern China.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with moderate rainfall and partial shade, making it suitable for forest understory environments. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties. It has been introduced to parts of North America and Europe for botanical research and horticultural purposes.</p>
<p>However, its natural range remains largely confined to its native habitat in China.</p>
