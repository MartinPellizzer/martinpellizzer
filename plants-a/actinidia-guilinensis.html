                <h1>Actinidia guilinensis</h1>
<p>Actinidia guilinensis, commonly known as Guilin kiwifruit, is a deciduous vine native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in appearance to common kiwifruit but have a unique flavor profile. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and fruit production, it is cultivated in various regions for both horticultural and agricultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia guilinensis has compound, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows in a climbing or shrub-like manner. The flowers are small, greenish-white, with five sepals and five petals, and they bloom in early summer, pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, yellowish berry that matures in late summer, dispersing primarily by birds and through mammalian consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia guilinensis is a rare and endemic species native to the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in southern China.</p>
<p>It is currently found only in a very limited area within its native range, primarily in the Guangxi province. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in the understorey of temperate forests. It typically occurs at altitudes between 500 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Actinidia guilinensis is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinidia guilinensis is a vigorous, deciduous vine known for its ornamental value and edible fruit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within two to three years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and pruning to shape the plant and promote fruiting are essential for healthy growth. While generally pest and disease resistant, it may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with garlic or marigolds can help deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinidia guilinensis is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers, supporting local pollination networks. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, improving soil fertility and benefiting surrounding vegetation. Its dense growth also helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves as a companion plant for other native species, enhancing overall ecosystem health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Actinidia guilinensis is a lesser-known species of the Actinidia genus, primarily valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife in its native habitat. In medicinal contexts, it has shown potential for its antioxidant properties, though further research is needed to validate its therapeutic uses. Economically, it is not a major crop but plays a role in horticultural trade and botanical research.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes the unique flora of its native region, contributing to regional identity and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Actinidia guilinensis has several varieties and cultivars that are cultivated for their ornamental and fruiting qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Guilin' and 'Xinxiang', which are prized for their attractive foliage and edible fruits. The plant has also been used in hybridization to create new cultivars with improved traits such as disease resistance and fruit size. Hybrids involving Actinidia guilinensis often combine the hardiness of other actinidias with its unique characteristics.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential for fruit production, it holds significant horticultural importance in gardens and agricultural settings.</p>
