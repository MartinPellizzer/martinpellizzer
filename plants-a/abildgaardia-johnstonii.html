<p>Abildgaardia johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's abildgaardia, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is adapted to the unique climate and soil conditions of its endemic habitat, which includes rocky coastal areas. It is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens due to its rarity and beauty.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this species from habitat loss and invasive species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia johnstonii is primarily native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>This rare plant is found exclusively in the volcanic soil of the island's mountainous regions. It is adapted to the unique microclimate and limited habitat conditions of St. Helena. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered an endemic species of the island.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this vulnerable plant from environmental threats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia johnstonii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This plant was introduced as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists and land managers.</p>
