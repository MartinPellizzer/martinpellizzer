                <h1>Acer lingii</h1>
<p>Acer lingii, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China and Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It typically grows to a height of 10-15 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
<p>Acer lingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal foliage changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lingii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5-8 cm in length; they are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod, which disperses by wind due to its light weight and gliding structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lingii is a rare species of maple native to the mountainous regions of western China, specifically in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. It thrives in temperate climates with cool, moist conditions, typically found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer lingii is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lingii is a rare and delicate maple species native to China, prized for its unique foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acer lingii is slow, with new growth emerging in spring and flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and improve garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lingii is a small tree or shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, yellowish flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of flora and fauna. Its shallow root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in forested areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer lingii contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting local food webs and improving habitat structure.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer lingii is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been traditionally used in some local medicinal practices for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to biodiversity and serves as a habitat for various wildlife species. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in regions where it grows naturally, often representing resilience and adaptability.</p>
<p>Its role in landscaping and conservation efforts highlights its broader ecological and aesthetic value.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer lingii has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Atropurpureum' and 'Variegatum', which are known for their striking foliage colors. Hybrid forms have been developed to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and fall color. These cultivars and hybrids are important in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to different garden conditions.</p>
<p>They are often used in landscaping and public gardens to add visual interest and diversity to the landscape.</p>
