                        <h1>Abies magnifica subsp. shastensis</h1>
<p>Abies magnifica subsp.</p>
<p>shastensis, commonly known as the Shasta fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches.</p>
<p>The cones are typically cylindrical and hang downward, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in subalpine or alpine regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of mountainous forests.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies magnifica subsp.</p>
<p>shastensis is primarily native to the coastal mountain ranges of northern California and southern Oregon. It is commonly found in the Klamath Mountains and the northern portions of the Sierra Nevada.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist, cool climates with high elevations, typically between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. It is often associated with mixed coniferous forests and grows in areas with well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions where the climate and habitat conditions are suitable for its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies magnifica subsp.</p>
<p>shastensis was mainly introduced to areas with high elevation and cool, moist climates, typically found in mountainous regions of the western United States. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This subspecies is commonly found in the Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges where its ecological niche is well-suited. It plays a vital role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often limited to regions with suitable environmental conditions.</p>
