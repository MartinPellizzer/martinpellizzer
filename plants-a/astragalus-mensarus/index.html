                            <h1>Astragalus Mensarus</h1>
<p>Yellow milkvetch, scientifically known as Astragalus mensarus, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow pea-like flowers and slender, branching stems. This species is well adapted to harsh environments, often thriving in sandy soils and rocky landscapes. Despite its resilience, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many parts of its range. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various pollinators and its potential medicinal uses.</p>
