                <h1>Aconitum × dragulescuanum nothosubsp. dragulescuanum</h1>
<p>Aconitum × dragulescuanum nothosubsp.</p>
<p>dragulescuanum, commonly known as the hybrid aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant produces blue to purple flowers with spurred petals, and its leaves are palmately divided with deeply cut lobes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is toxic and should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum × dragulescuanum nothosubsp.</p>
<p>dragulescuanum has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically have a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. The stem is tall and erect, covered with a rough, bark-like texture, and exhibits a deep reddish-brown color.</p>
<p>Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with spurred petals and a complex structure that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies; they bloom in late summer. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fibrous, and adapted for anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum × dragulescuanum nothosubsp.</p>
<p>dragulescuanum is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of the Carpathian Basin, primarily found in Hungary and parts of Serbia. Its current distribution is limited to specific areas in the Carpathian Mountains, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in forested slopes and meadows at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,200 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss and climate change, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum × dragulescuanum nothosubsp.</p>
<p>dragulescuanum is a hybrid ornamental plant known for its striking blue or purple flowers. It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of rhizomes, with seed propagation requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, though it may behave as a short-lived perennial in some climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering during the growing season, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring supports healthy growth, and pruning dead foliage in early spring helps maintain its vigor. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns can enhance its visual appeal in shaded garden areas.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aconitum × dragulescuanum nothosubsp.</p>
<p>dragulescuanum is a hybrid plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its showy flowers attract a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. It also plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion due to its deep root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and habitat for small invertebrates and can support the broader ecological balance in its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
