                    <h1>Adiantum nudum</h1>
<p>Adiantum nudum, commonly known as the naked maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and somewhat glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its unique feature is the absence of the typical protective sheath on its young fronds, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Adiantum nudum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
