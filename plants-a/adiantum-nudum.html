                <h1>Adiantum nudum</h1>
<p>Adiantum nudum, commonly known as the naked maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and somewhat glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its unique feature is the absence of the typical protective sheath on its young fronds, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Adiantum nudum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum nudum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lacey appearance, typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually light green, with a slender, branching structure and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows in a creeping or upright pattern depending on the environment. Adiantum nudum produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves, and it does not produce true flowers or seeds.</p>
<p>The plant relies on spores for reproduction, which are dispersed by wind, and its roots are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, rocky or soil substrates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum nudum is primarily native to Brazil North, Brazil West-Central, Colombia, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Adiantum nudum is often associated with humid climates and is typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the Neotropical regions of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum nudum was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in states such as New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.</p>
<p>It has been documented in various habitats including moist woodlands, stream banks, and rocky areas. The plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is often linked to human activities such as landscaping and accidental dispersal through waterways.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
