                    <h1>Avena palustris</h1>
<p>Avena palustris, commonly known as swamp oats, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, bogs, and other moist environments, thriving in poorly drained soils. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Avena palustris is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity.</p>
