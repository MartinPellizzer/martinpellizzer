                    <h1>Aeginetia pedunculata var. acaulis</h1>
<p>Aeginetia pedunculata var. acaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, hairless stems that often appear stemless due to the absence of a distinct stem base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by spherical, dry fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
