                    <h1>Acacia octonervia</h1>
<p>Acacia octonervia, commonly known as the eight-veined acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and compound leaves composed of several narrow, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Acacia octonervia is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its wood is sometimes used locally for fuel and construction, though it is not as economically significant as other acacia species.</p>
