<p>Aphanes canadensis, commonly known as Canadian sandweed, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and disturbed areas. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are usually clustered at the base, and it produces tiny white or pale green flowers in early spring. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it is often considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
<p>Aphanes canadensis is also valued for its ability to stabilize soils in arid or coastal environments.</p>
