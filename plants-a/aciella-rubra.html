                <h1>Aciella rubra</h1>
<p>Aciella rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered aciella, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Aciella rubra is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant blooms and compact growth habit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciella rubra has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often reddish in color, with a smooth texture, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern using tendrils. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with five petals, typically pink or red in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciella rubra is primarily native to the southern regions of South America, specifically Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas and dry shrublands, often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. This plant is commonly associated with sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid conditions. It is particularly prevalent in the Valpara√≠so and Coquimbo regions of Chile.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in the local ecosystems of these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciella rubra was mainly introduced to the western United States and parts of California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats with full sun exposure. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several ecological regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it is found.</p>
