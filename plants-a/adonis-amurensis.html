<p>It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a short, stout stem that bears a single, showy, bell-shaped flower. The plant's flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, recurved lip. Adonis amurensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis amurensis has basal leaves that are spoon-shaped (cordate), arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly woody with a reddish-brown color, growing from the base of the plant.

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis amurensis is primarily native to Amur, Japan, Khabarovsk, Korea, Kuril Is., Manchuria, Primorye, Sakhalin.</p>
<p>This plant is found in regions that span across eastern Asia, particularly in the temperate and subarctic climates of these areas. It thrives in rocky or mountainous terrain, often in alpine or subalpine zones. The species is adapted to the cold and harsh environmental conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes both mainland areas and several islands in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis amurensis was mainly introduced to new habitats outside its native range, often as part of ornamental horticulture or ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions of Europe, particularly in the United Kingdom and parts of Scandinavia. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have contributed to its spread in these areas. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, careful management is necessary to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
