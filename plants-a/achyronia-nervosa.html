                <h1>Achyronia nervosa</h1>
<p>Achyronia nervosa, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic to some animals.</p>
<p>Achyronia nervosa plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia nervosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia nervosa is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps and wetlands. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, subtropical climate of its native range. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia nervosa was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in states like Texas, Louisiana, and Florida.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in disturbed soils along roadsides, agricultural fields, and riverbanks. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is often linked to human activities such as land development and the movement of contaminated soil.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it has also been studied for its ecological impact and potential use in phytoremediation.</p>
