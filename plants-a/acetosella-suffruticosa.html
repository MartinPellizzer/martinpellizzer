                        <h1>Acetosella suffruticosa</h1>
<p>Acetosella suffruticosa, commonly known as the shrubby sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of slender, woody stems covered with small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, rounded fruits. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, giving them a tart, sour taste.</p>
<p>Acetosella suffruticosa is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and along stream banks.</p>
