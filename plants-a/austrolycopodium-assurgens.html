                    <h1>Austrolycopodium assurgens</h1>
<p>Austrolycopodium assurgens, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit with narrow, spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. Austrolycopodium assurgens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
