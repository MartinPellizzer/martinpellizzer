<p>Aechmea prasinata, commonly known as the green aechmea, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect water and nutrients. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. It produces vibrant, spathaceous flowers that are often pink or red, emerging from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to humid environments and thrives in bright, indirect light.</p>
