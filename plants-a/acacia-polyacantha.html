                        <h1>Acacia polyacantha</h1>
<p>Acacia polyacantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and compound leaves composed of numerous small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Acacia polyacantha is well adapted to drought and poor soils, making it a resilient component of native ecosystems.</p>
