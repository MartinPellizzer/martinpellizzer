                <h1>Acer acinatum</h1>
<p>Acer acinatum, commonly known as the maple-leaved elm, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of maple trees. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, greenish fruits that turn red as they mature. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it typically grows to a height of 20 to 30 meters.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer acinatum has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, typically 5â€“10 cm in length, and turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes furrowed with age, and it grows as a single trunk with a spreading crown. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, arranged in upright clusters, and they are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a paired samara with winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the tree in soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer acinatum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and human activity. It thrives in rocky, sunny slopes and dry, temperate climates, typically growing at elevations between 600 and 1,500 meters. Conservation status is currently listed as vulnerable, with populations declining due to habitat degradation and climate change.</p>
<p>Efforts to preserve and restore its natural habitat are ongoing to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer acinatum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in diverse conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer acinatum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or fungal infections in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sage can help deter pests and improve soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer acinatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting biodiversity in the ecosystem. The tree also acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of nearby vegetation through improved soil conditions. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and reducing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer acinatum contributes to carbon sequestration, playing a vital role in maintaining ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer acinatum is a tree known for its ornamental value and diverse applications.</p>
<p>Its wood is used in the furniture and construction industries due to its strength and durability.
