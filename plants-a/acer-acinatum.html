                <h1>Acer acinatum</h1>
<p>Acer acinatum, commonly known as the maple-leaved elm, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acer genus, which includes various maple species, though it is more closely related to elms than to typical maples. The tree is characterized by its alternate, palmately compound leaves that resemble those of maples, with three to five leaflets. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer acinatum has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a broad, ovate shape and a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 10â€“15 cm in length, displaying a vibrant green on the upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a vertical growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in panicles, blooming in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and gliding structure.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer acinatum is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to isolated populations in Spain and Portugal. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in rocky soils and on steep slopes. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, Acer acinatum is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer acinatum is a striking maple tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique, lantern-like seed pods.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The tree grows slowly, reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in full sun with well-drained, fertile soil, needing regular watering during dry periods. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune dead or diseased branches in late winter to promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with flowering shrubs and perennials for aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer acinatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its seeds are consumed by small mammals and birds. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. It also contributes to erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer acinatum plays a role in maintaining the overall health of the ecosystem by supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer acinatum is a tree known for its versatile uses across various fields.</p>
<p>Its wood is valued in the industrial and economic sectors for furniture making and construction due to its strength and durability. In traditional medicine, parts of the tree have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some regions, representing resilience and growth.</p>
<p>However, its culinary applications are limited, as the tree is not commonly used for food.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer acinatum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Erectum' and 'Sutherlandii', which are known for their striking foliage and unique growth habits. Hybrids of Acer acinatum are often developed to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and disease resistance. These cultivars and hybrids play a significant role in horticulture, particularly in gardens and landscapes where their aesthetic appeal is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Their versatility makes them a desirable choice for both public and private gardening spaces.</p>
