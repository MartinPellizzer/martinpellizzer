                    <h1>Aguiaria</h1>
<p>Aguiaria, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Leguminosae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and aromatic properties. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by legume-like pods containing seeds. Aguiaria is valued for its hardwood, which is used in the production of musical instruments and fine furniture.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
