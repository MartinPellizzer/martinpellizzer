                <h1>Adiantum nanum</h1>
<p>Adiantum nanum, commonly known as the small maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum nanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum nanum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feather-like appearance, and are typically light green in color.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark. This plant does not produce flowers; instead, it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Its roots are rhizomatous, forming a network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Adiantum nanum is a small, elegant plant often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum nanum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. It is also present in parts of the Caribbean, including the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to areas with high rainfall and warm climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum nanum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through horticultural trade or as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant has since become established in wetland and riparian habitats, often in disturbed areas near water. Its spread has been facilitated by its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments and its rapid reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions and is often found in association with native vegetation.</p>
