                    <h1>Atriplex glauca var. crystallina</h1>
<p>Atriplex glauca var. crystallina, commonly known as crystalline saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its salt tolerance makes it well adapted to saline soils, and it is often found in coastal areas and inland salt flats.</p>
<p>The plant's unique appearance and ecological resilience make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
