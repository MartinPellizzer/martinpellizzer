                <h1>Aconitum nemorosum</h1>
<p>Aconitum nemorosum, commonly known as the wood anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has palmately lobed leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Aconitum nemorosum is also known for its toxic properties, containing various alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum nemorosum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath, with a rough texture and a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hollow, and has a greyish-brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurred lower petal, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum nemorosum is primarily native to temperate regions of Europe, particularly in the mountainous areas of the Alps and the Carpathians.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central and Southern Europe, including countries such as France, Italy, and Germany. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments like woodlands and stream sides. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with mixed forests.</p>
<p>Its native distribution includes regions with cool, humid climates where it can flourish in partial to full shade.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum nemorosum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue to purple flowers and its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments. The introduction has led to its establishment in natural areas, where it can outcompete native vegetation. It is now considered invasive in some regions, posing a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, its spread requires careful management to prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
