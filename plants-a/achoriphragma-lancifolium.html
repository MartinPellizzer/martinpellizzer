                <h1>Achoriphragma lancifolium</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma lancifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma lancifolium has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma lancifolium is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and arid environments, often growing in coastal areas and mountainous regions. The plant thrives in regions with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It is particularly common in countries such as Spain, Italy, Morocco, and Turkey.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is also found in some areas of the United States, particularly in California and the southwestern states.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma lancifolium was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can spread rapidly in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
