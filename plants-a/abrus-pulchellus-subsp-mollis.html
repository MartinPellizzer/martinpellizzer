<p>The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and produces a strong, unpleasant odor when the pods mature. Its hairy, velvety leaves and stems give it a unique tactile appearance.</p>
<p>Due to the toxicity of its seeds, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>

<p>mollis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This species thrives in forest understories and along riverbanks, where it receives partial to full sunlight. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats due to its adaptability.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world in horticultural settings.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>

<p>mollis was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It is commonly cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking red seed pods.</p>
<p>This species has also been introduced to regions with similar ecological conditions in tropical and subtropical zones. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Care should be taken with its seeds, as they contain toxic compounds that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>
