                <h1>Acrostichum crassinerve</h1>
<p>Acrostichum crassinerve, commonly known as the broad-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive broad and prominent midrib. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests or near water bodies. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum crassinerve plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates and small animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum crassinerve has large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically broad and dark green, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually elongated with a rough, fibrous texture and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are wind-pollinated and bloom during the late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum crassinerve is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with swampy or wetland areas where it can tolerate standing water. Its broad, leathery leaves are adapted to the moist, shaded conditions of its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Acrostichum crassinerve is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum crassinerve was mainly introduced to disturbed habitats such as roadsides, riverbanks, and construction sites due to its adaptability to poor soil conditions and high light exposure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in wet or semi-aquatic environments. This plant has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental use in landscaping and its role in stabilizing soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
