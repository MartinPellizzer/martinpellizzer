                    <h1>Acanthostachys</h1>
<p>Acanthostachys, commonly known as the spikeless papyrus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Africa and are often found in wetland or marshy habitats. They are characterized by their grass-like appearance and the presence of spikelets that lack the typical bract structures found in other Cyperaceae species. Acanthostachys species typically grow in dense clusters and have narrow, linear leaves.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, often arranged in terminal clusters, and the genus is known for its ecological importance in aquatic and semi-aquatic environments.</p>
