<p>Acacia drummondii subsp.</p>
<p>affinis, commonly known as the Drummond's wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, yellow-flowered inflorescences that appear during the warmer months.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grey-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces long, slender pods that contain seeds with a hard coat, typical of many legumes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils in degraded areas.</p>
