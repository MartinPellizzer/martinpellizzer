                    <h1>Aspidopterys oxyphylla</h1>
<p>Aspidopterys oxyphylla, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores on the undersides of its fronds rather than flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
