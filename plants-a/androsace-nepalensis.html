                    <h1>Androsace nepalensis</h1>
<p>Androsace nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal rock-jelly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Nepal and surrounding Himalayan areas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing white or pale pink flowers that are adapted to the cold, high-altitude environment. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Androsace nepalensis is often found growing on rocky slopes and meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
