<p>Its species is Acalypha pervilleana, a specific plant within the genus Acalypha, known for its unique floral structures and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha pervilleana is primarily native to Comoros, Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of these islands, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is commonly associated with humid forests and coastal areas. It plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic locations within the Indian Ocean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha pervilleana was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas in Hawaii, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found along stream banks, forest edges, and in disturbed soils, often forming dense stands that can outcompete native vegetation. This plant spreads primarily through its prolific seed production and ability to establish quickly in new habitats. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a significant invasive species in the region.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive nature, it is often listed as a noxious weed in several Hawaiian counties.</p>
