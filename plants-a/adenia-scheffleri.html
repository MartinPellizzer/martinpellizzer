                <h1>Adenia scheffleri</h1>
<p>Adenia scheffleri, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant has thick, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. Its flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Adenia scheffleri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia scheffleri has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to grey in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are small, greenish-white with yellow stamens, clustered in axillary inflorescences, and they bloom from late winter to early spring, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia scheffleri is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and KwaZulu-Natal. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within forests and along stream banks. It is commonly found in the fynbos vegetation type, which is characteristic of the region.</p>
<p>Adenia scheffleri is also occasionally seen in Zimbabwe and Swaziland.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia scheffleri was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with partial to full sunlight and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. This plant is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and flowering characteristics. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, parts of Australia, and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
