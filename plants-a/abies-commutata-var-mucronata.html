                        <h1>Abies commutata var. mucronata</h1>
<p>Abies commutata var. mucronata, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada fir, is a variant of the white fir native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical white fir. The cones are typically reddish-brown and mature to a dark brown, with a distinctive short, sharp bract at the base. This variety thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in subalpine or alpine zones with cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh climates of its native range.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies commutata var. mucronata is primarily native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range in the western United States.</p>
<p>This variety is commonly found in subalpine and alpine zones, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is particularly associated with areas of the Pacific Northwest, including parts of California, Oregon, and Washington. The plant typically grows in mixed coniferous forests, often alongside other species such as Douglas fir and white fir.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution is due to its specific ecological requirements and the harsh conditions of its high-altitude habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies commutata var. mucronata was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its ornamental value, including its pyramidal shape and attractive foliage. This variety is particularly suited for USDA hardiness zones 4 to 7, where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its introduction has been primarily for horticultural purposes, though it occasionally escapes into natural habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a popular choice for landscaping in regions with temperate climates.</p>
