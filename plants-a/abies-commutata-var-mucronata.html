                    <h1>Abies commutata var. mucronata</h1>
<p>Abies commutata var. mucronata, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada fir, is a variant of the white fir native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical white fir. The cones are typically reddish-brown and mature to a dark brown, with a distinctive short, sharp bract at the base. This variety thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in subalpine or alpine zones with cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh climates of its native range.</p>
