                <h1>Adelia caperoniifolia</h1>
<p>Adelia caperoniifolia, commonly known as the Capronii leaf tree, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and sumac. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into numerous small, elliptical leaflets. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange-red berries.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit structure.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia caperoniifolia has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and slightly woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and enabling the plant to thrive in rocky or arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia caperoniifolia is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Australia, particularly in the states of New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in dune ecosystems along the southern coastline. It is well adapted to the harsh maritime environment, including salt spray and strong winds. Adelia caperoniifolia is often seen growing in open habitats such as beaches and coastal heaths.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific areas, making it a rare and ecologically significant species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia caperoniifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in natural habitats. It is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
