<p>Athyrium punethae, commonly known as the Himalayan maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest areas at high altitudes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Athyrium punethae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
