<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema glomeriflora is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern Brazil. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often encountered in secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it plays a vital role in the biodiversity of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema glomeriflora was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its ornamental value due to its attractive, clustered flowers. This plant prefers full sun to partial shade and requires regular watering to thrive.
