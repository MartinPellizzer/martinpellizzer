                        <h1>Acacia senegal var. rupestris</h1>
<p>Acacia senegal var. rupestris, commonly known as the stunted acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a gum that is harvested for its economic and medicinal uses. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes soil stabilization and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia senegal var. rupestris is primarily native to the Sahel region of Africa, including countries such as Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils and along riverbanks. This variant is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. It is commonly found in scrublands and savannas, where it plays an important ecological role.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its gum production, which has economic significance in local communities.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia senegal var. rupestris was mainly introduced to arid and semi-arid regions for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its potential for gum production.</p>
<p>It has been widely planted in countries such as Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somalia for ecological restoration and economic purposes. The plant is valued for its drought tolerance and capacity to prevent soil erosion in degraded landscapes. However, its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species and altered local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, it remains an important species in certain regions for both environmental and commercial reasons.</p>
