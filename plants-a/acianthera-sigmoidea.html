                <h1>Acianthera sigmoidea</h1>
<p>Acianthera sigmoidea, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, zigzagging stems. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera sigmoidea has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly rough texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, displaying a pale pink to white color, blooming during the late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera sigmoidea is primarily native to Costa Rica.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the Caribbean slope. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the cloud forests and lowland rainforests. The plant is often associated with rocky or mossy substrates in these habitats.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to specific microhabitats within Costa Rica's diverse ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera sigmoidea was mainly introduced to the region of Southeastern Brazil, particularly in the states of Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid forests and disturbed areas with high rainfall. The plant thrives in shaded environments and is often associated with secondary vegetation. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and anthropogenic habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become a notable species in local flora.</p>
