                <h1>Adonis daucifolia</h1>
<p>Adonis daucifolia, commonly known as the Alpine glory of the snow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and distinctive umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its flowers, which range from white to pale yellow, bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to high-altitude landscapes.</p>
<p>Adonis daucifolia is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis daucifolia has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are erect and somewhat hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, growing in a straight, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are umbellate, consisting of small, white to pale yellow petals arranged in a flat-topped cluster, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, schizocarp that splits into two mericarps, each containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis daucifolia is primarily native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and Palestine.</p>
<p>It is also found in the Caucasus, extending into northern Iran and southern Russia. This plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in mountainous areas. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Adonis daucifolia is commonly found in alpine and subalpine environments at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis daucifolia was mainly introduced to new environments as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in gardens and public spaces across temperate regions. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its spread is often facilitated by seed dispersal through wind, water, or human activity.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
