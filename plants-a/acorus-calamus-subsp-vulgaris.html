                <h1>Acorus calamus subsp. vulgaris</h1>
<p>Acorus calamus subsp.</p>
<p>vulgaris, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has long, narrow leaves that are often aromatic and possess a distinctive, sweet scent.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellowish-green spadices that are clustered at the base of the leaves. It thrives in shallow water and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are commonly harvested for various commercial and medicinal purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus subsp.</p>
<p>vulgaris has long, sword-shaped leaves that are narrow and tapering, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant, with a bright green color and a waxy surface. The stem is tall and cylindrical, with a smooth, dark brown bark that has a fibrous texture, growing upright from the base.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in dense, umbrella-like clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, three-chambered capsule that releases dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by water or wind.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense underground network that helps the plant spread and anchor itself in wet environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus subsp.</p>
<p>vulgaris is a wetland plant native to temperate regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and parts of Southeast Asia. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world, such as North America and Europe, often in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>This species thrives in marshes, along the edges of ponds, and in slow-moving freshwater streams. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is considered a least concern species due to its adaptability and widespread distribution, though local populations may be affected by habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus subsp.</p>
<p>vulgaris is a versatile aquatic plant commonly used in water gardens and wetland restoration. It can be propagated through rhizome division or by planting rhizome fragments in shallow water or moist soil. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in rich, loamy soil with consistent moisture, requiring regular watering to maintain wet conditions. Fertilization with a balanced aquatic fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning dead leaves helps maintain its appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections in stagnant water.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other water-loving plants like cattails or iris can enhance its ecological benefits and aesthetic appeal.</p>
