                    <h1>Avena × altior</h1>
<p>Avena × altior, commonly known as the tall oat, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Avena sativa (common oat) and Avena fatua (wild oat).</p>
<p>It is a tall, annual grass that can grow up to 2 meters in height, characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, two-lobed spikelets, which contain the characteristic oat grains. Avena × altior is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of hybridization and grass evolution.</p>
