                    <h1>Aloe altilinea</h1>
<p>Aloe altilinea, commonly known as the tall aloe or narrow-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features upright, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height, often branching at the base. The plant produces narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are borne in terminal inflorescences, consisting of yellow to orange tubular blooms.</p>
<p>Aloe altilinea is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and showing resilience to drought conditions.</p>
