<p>Anabasis florida, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Anabasis florida is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
