                    <h1>Afrorchis congoensis</h1>
<p>Afrorchis congoensis, commonly known as the Congo orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near water sources. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires protection.</p>
