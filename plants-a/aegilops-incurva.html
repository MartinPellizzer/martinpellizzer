                <h1>Aegilops incurva</h1>
<p>Aegilops incurva, commonly known as the bent spikegrass, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its drooping, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Aegilops incurva has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, two-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>It is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential role in agricultural research and its ecological adaptability.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops incurva has leaves that are narrow, grass-like, and slightly curled, with a dark green color and a parallel venation pattern; they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikelets, with pale green to brown bracts, and they bloom in late spring to early summer; they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a caryopsis, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
