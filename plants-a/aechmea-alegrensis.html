                <h1>Aechmea alegrensis</h1>
<p>Aechmea alegrensis, commonly known as the SÃ£o Paulo pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces strikingly colorful inflorescences with showy bracts that range from red to orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Aechmea alegrensis is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea alegrensis has leaves that are strap-shaped, arranged in a rosette, with a waxy blue-gray surface and a dark green underside, measuring up to 40 cm in length.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, thick stem with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright from the base. Its flowers are clustered in a terminal spike, featuring vibrant red bracts with yellowish-white petals, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. The fruit is a small, three-lobed berry that turns red when mature, dispersing seeds through both animal consumption and wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding environment.</p>
