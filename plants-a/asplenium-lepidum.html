<p>Asplenium lepidum, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that have a silvery-green appearance due to the presence of trichomes on the leaf surface. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium lepidum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
