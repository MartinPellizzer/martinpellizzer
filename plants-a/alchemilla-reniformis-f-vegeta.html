                    <h1>Alchemilla reniformis f. vegeta</h1>
<p>Alchemilla reniformis f. vegeta, commonly known as the compact alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, rounded foliage composed of soft, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose, open panicles. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor, rocky soils make it well-suited for alpine gardens and rockeries.</p>
<p>The f. vegeta form is distinguished by its more compact and bushier structure compared to the species form.</p>
