                <h1>Aconitum consanguineum</h1>
<p>Aconitum consanguineum, commonly known as the bloodroot aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a stout, hairy stem with palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed. Its roots are highly toxic, containing potent alkaloids such as aconitine, which make it dangerous to handle.</p>
<p>Aconitum consanguineum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens, though caution is required due to its toxic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum consanguineum has compound, pinnate leaves that are dark green and glossy, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and cylindrical, with a greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in racemes, and have five petal-like sepals and a spurred lower petal, blooming from July to August, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum consanguineum is primarily native to the regions of Amur, Khabarovsk, and Primorye.</p>
<p>These areas are located in the Russian Far East, characterized by temperate and subarctic climates. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and mountainous regions. It is well adapted to the cool and humid conditions of these habitats.</p>
<p>Aconitum consanguineum is an important part of the local flora and is often found in the wild in these specific regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum consanguineum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue to purple flowers. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in moist, disturbed soils. The plant is now found in various wetland and riparian habitats throughout the area.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
