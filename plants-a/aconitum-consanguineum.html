                    <h1>Aconitum consanguineum</h1>
<p>Aconitum consanguineum, commonly known as the bloodroot aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a stout, hairy stem with palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed. Its roots are highly toxic, containing potent alkaloids such as aconitine, which make it dangerous to handle.</p>
<p>Aconitum consanguineum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens, though caution is required due to its toxic properties.</p>
