                <h1>Adenocalymma macrophyllum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma macrophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaved adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and wetlands.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma macrophyllum has simple, alternate leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and slightly woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and aiding in the plant's survival in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma macrophyllum is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, particularly in the states of SÃ£o Paulo and Minas Gerais. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with forested areas and is often found in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific regions within Brazil's southeastern territory.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma macrophyllum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, disturbed forests, and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in regions with moderate to high rainfall. This plant is often spread through seed dispersal by wind, water, or animals, contributing to its rapid colonization of new areas. Its ability to grow in poor soil conditions makes it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>It is also known for its striking yellow flowers, which attract pollinators and enhance its competitive advantage in invaded ecosystems.</p>
