                <h1>Aconitum galectonum</h1>
<p>Aconitum galectonum, commonly known as the Galician aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, conical clusters. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, somewhat fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Aconitum galectonum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum galectonum has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a greyish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spires, and are pollinated by insects; they bloom in late summer. The fruit is a follicle containing small, dark seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, serving as storage organs for nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum galectonum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, including countries such as France, Italy, Spain, and parts of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky soils and open meadows at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. This plant is commonly associated with limestone and calcareous substrates, which provide the necessary conditions for its growth. It is also known to occur in some parts of western Asia, particularly in regions with similar climatic and geological conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and localized species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum galectonum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and outcompetes native flora.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about biodiversity loss and ecological disruption.</p>
