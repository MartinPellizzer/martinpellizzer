                    <h1>Aridarum annae</h1>
<p>Aridarum annae, commonly known as the Ann's desert orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, succulent-like growth form and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions through its thick, fleshy leaves that store water. It blooms primarily during the brief rainy season, making it a short-lived but striking addition to its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
