                <h1>Aconogonon tibeticum</h1>
<p>Aconogonon tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to extreme conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aconogonon tibeticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconogonon tibeticum has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 3â€“5 cm in length, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and is often branched. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white to pale pink petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that disperses seeds through wind, and the seeds are small and numerous.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or mountainous soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconogonon tibeticum is primarily native to the Himalayan regions of Asia, including countries such as India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats at high elevations. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often growing in open meadows and mountain slopes. Its distribution is closely associated with the unique ecological conditions of the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding mountain ranges.</p>
<p>It is a characteristic species of the alpine flora in this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconogonon tibeticum was mainly introduced to disturbed sites such as roadsides, waste areas, and along trails where soil is compacted or nutrient-poor.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun to partial shade and can tolerate a range of soil types. This plant is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, growing at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of Tibet, where it has become naturalized in some areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a potential invasive species in certain ecological contexts.</p>
