<p>Arthropteris orientalis var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental water fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
