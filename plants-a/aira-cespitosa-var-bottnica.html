                    <h1>Aira cespitosa var. bottnica</h1>
<p>Aira cespitosa var. bottnica, commonly known as the Bottnica false oat, is a perennial grass native to northern regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along riverbanks. The plant features tufted growth with slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to wetland environments, with rhizomes that help stabilize soil and promote vegetative spread.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
