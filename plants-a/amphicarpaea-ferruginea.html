<p>Amphicarpaea ferruginea, commonly known as rusty false flax, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to produce two types of fruits: one above ground and one below ground, a trait known as amphicarpy. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its rusty-colored stems and leaves give it its common name, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation.</p>
