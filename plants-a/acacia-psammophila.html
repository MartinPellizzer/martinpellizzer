                    <h1>Acacia psammophila</h1>
<p>Acacia psammophila, commonly known as the silver acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant has slender, pale green stems and produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are small and feathery, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Acacia psammophila is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in desert ecosystems.</p>
