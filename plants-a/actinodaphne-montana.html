                <h1>Actinodaphne montana</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne montana, commonly known as the mountain actinodaphne, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a drupe, typically containing a single seed, and it thrives in humid, tropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne montana has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pale underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, arranged spirally along the stems. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin layers. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with three sepals and three petals, blooming during the rainy season and relying on insect pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-lobed berry that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal ingestion and droppings.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne montana is primarily native to Malaya, Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of these regions. This plant thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is often associated with lowland and montane forests.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific areas within these countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne montana was mainly introduced to new habitats in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.</p>
<p>It has been established in disturbed forest areas and along riverbanks due to its adaptability to varying soil conditions. The plant is often found in lowland and foothill regions where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its introduction has led to some ecological concerns as it can compete with native species in invaded areas.</p>
<p>Despite its potential invasiveness, it is also valued for its aromatic leaves used in traditional medicine and cuisine.</p>
