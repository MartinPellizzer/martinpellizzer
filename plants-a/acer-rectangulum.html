                <h1>Acer rectangulum</h1>
<p>Acer rectangulum, commonly known as the rectangular maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves with a unique rectangular base, which sets it apart from other maple species. The tree produces small, red-orange flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Acer rectangulum is often planted for its ornamental value and contributes to local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rectangulum has palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, typically with five to seven divisions, arranged alternately along the stem, and measure around 5-10 cm in diameter, turning vibrant red in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern with a moderate height. It produces small, clustered yellow-green flowers in spring, with separate male and female flowers, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to its light weight and wing structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rectangulum is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as temperate forests and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, Acer rectangulum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rectangulum is a unique maple species known for its distinctive rectangular-shaped leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer rectangulum includes a dormant period in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer rectangulum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shade and nutrient cycling. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer rectangulum supports ecological balance by offering habitat and resources throughout different stages of the ecosystem's life cycle.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer rectangulum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is occasionally employed in traditional herbal remedies for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>It has minimal industrial applications due to its small size and limited wood yield, though its sap can be harvested for syrup production in certain regions. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in some indigenous communities, representing resilience and adaptability. Economically, it contributes to local biodiversity and ecological balance, supporting wildlife and forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its role in environmental conservation makes it an important plant for ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer rectangulum has several popular cultivars, including 'Karlovy Vary' and 'Sutherlandii', which are prized for their striking foliage and unique leaf shapes.</p>
<p>It is also involved in the creation of hybrids such as Acer Ã— carpinifolium, which combines traits from Acer rectangulum and Acer carpinus. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced ornamental qualities, making them valuable in horticultural settings. Due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability, Acer rectangulum plays an important role in landscape design and botanical collections.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids continue to be cultivated for their visual impact and ecological benefits.</p>
