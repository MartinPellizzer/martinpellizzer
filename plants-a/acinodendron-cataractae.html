                    <h1>Acinodendron cataractae</h1>
<p>Acinodendron cataractae, commonly known as the waterfall acacia, is a rare shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to thrive in high-altitude, humid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in small, woody pods that split open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acinodendron cataractae is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
