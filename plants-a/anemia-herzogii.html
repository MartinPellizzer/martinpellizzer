<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its succulent leaves and vibrant, daisy-like flowers. The plant exhibits a low-growing habit with fleshy, often blue-green foliage that stores water, adapting to arid environments. Its flowers bloom in shades of yellow and orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
