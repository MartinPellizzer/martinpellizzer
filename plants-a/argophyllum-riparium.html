                    <h1>Argophyllum riparium</h1>
<p>Argophyllum riparium, commonly known as waterweed, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the wetlands and riverbanks of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface or grow just beneath it. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting insects and other pollinators. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist environments.</p>
<p>Argophyllum riparium plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
