                    <h1>Astrocaryum horridum</h1>
<p>Astrocaryum horridum, commonly known as the buriti palm, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a tall, slender palm tree that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with a straight trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves. The plant is characterized by its rough, spiny surface on the trunk and its clusters of yellowish-orange fruits that contain edible seeds.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to wet tropical environments, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
