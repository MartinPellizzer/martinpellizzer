                <h1>Adhatoda orchioides</h1>
<p>Adhatoda orchioides, commonly known as the Indian Trumpet or Blue Trumpet, is a flowering plant native to India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the branches.</p>
<p>Adhatoda orchioides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda orchioides has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth surface and a slightly wavy margin.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and has a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and penetrate deep into the soil, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda orchioides is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in moist, shaded areas within forests or along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. It is also present in parts of southern China and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these geographic areas, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda orchioides was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering patterns.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses. Its introduction has led to its presence in some non-native areas where it may become invasive.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
