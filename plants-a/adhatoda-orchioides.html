                <h1>Adhatoda orchioides</h1>
<p>Adhatoda orchioides, commonly known as the purple orchid tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking purple or violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive and visually appealing addition to gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda orchioides has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; they are typically 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips. The flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, with blue-violet petals and a tubular corolla, blooming from April to June and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, aiding in the plant's anchorage and nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda orchioides is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Asia, particularly India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited, with scattered populations primarily in the Indian subcontinent. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth, often found in humid and tropical climates. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Adhatoda orchioides is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda orchioides is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for faster growth. The plant has a perennial growth cycle, thriving in warm climates and blooming during the summer months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage new growth are essential. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adhatoda orchioides is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit offers shelter and habitat for various small wildlife species, including insects and birds. It acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing soil health and supporting biodiversity. The plant also contributes to erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and promoting the growth of other plants in the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adhatoda orchioides is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, known for its various uses and applications.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it is used to treat respiratory conditions such as coughs and bronchitis due to its expectorant properties.
