<p>Acrostichum ciliare, commonly known as the silky fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely toothed fronds that are often covered in soft, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with multiple pairs of pinnae that give the plant its distinctive appearance.</p>
