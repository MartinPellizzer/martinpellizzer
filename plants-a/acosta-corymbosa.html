                <h1>Acosta corymbosa</h1>
<p>Acosta corymbosa, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red or orange tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy texture.</p>
<p>Acosta corymbosa thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta corymbosa has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are usually green and have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, white flowers are clustered in corymbs and bloom in the spring, relying on insect pollination for reproduction. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta corymbosa is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in cloud forests and mountainous areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often associated with secondary growth in forest understories. It is also occasionally found in the western parts of Colombia and northern Argentina.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta corymbosa was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high rainfall and well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species in invaded habitats.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>
