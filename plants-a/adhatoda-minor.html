<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Adhatoda minor is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional systems of medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda minor has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a light brown bark that peels off in thin strips.

The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
