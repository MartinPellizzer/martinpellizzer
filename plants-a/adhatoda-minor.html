                <h1>Adhatoda minor</h1>
<p>Adhatoda minor, commonly known as lesser adhatoda, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright stem, lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers. The plant is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported respiratory and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many other medicinal and ornamental plants.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda minor has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, somewhat woody, with a rough texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with pale blue or violet petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda minor is a small, flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly found in regions of India, Nepal, and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>It is now distributed across parts of Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Malaysia, as well as some areas of China. This species thrives in moist, tropical environments, often growing in forests or along riverbanks. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adhatoda minor is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, but its habitat is under threat due to deforestation and land use changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda minor is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, valued for its ornamental foliage and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering the fastest and most reliable results. The plant grows best in a warm climate with a distinct wet and dry season, typically blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering during the growing season, though it should be allowed to dry out between waterings. Fertilize it with a balanced fertilizer in spring, and prune back any dead or overgrown branches to maintain shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or citronella can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>
