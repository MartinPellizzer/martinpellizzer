<p>Athyrium strigillosum, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas, preferring rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Athyrium strigillosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions.</p>
