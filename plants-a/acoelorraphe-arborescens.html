                <h1>Acoelorraphe arborescens</h1>
<p>Acoelorraphe arborescens, commonly known as the tree hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring palmately lobed leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming in summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in humid, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoelorraphe arborescens has leaves that are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a spreading, shrub-like form. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in terminal panicles, and bloom from late spring to early summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoelorraphe arborescens is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments, particularly in marshes and swamps where it can access the moisture it requires. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and brackish conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>However, its distribution has been limited due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoelorraphe arborescens was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species that has spread across various habitats, including coastal dunes and disturbed areas. The plant's rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to its displacement of native vegetation. It is often found in areas with high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive nature, it poses a threat to the ecological balance of the region.</p>
