<p>Agalmyla roseoflava, commonly known as the red-flowered agalmyla, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant rose-colored flowers, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sunlight to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and delicate nature, it is considered a threatened species in the wild.</p>
