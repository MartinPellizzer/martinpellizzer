<p>Ardisia morobeensis, commonly known as the Morobe ardisia, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Bougainville in the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many shrubs and small trees adapted to acidic soils. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by dark red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ardisia morobeensis is characterized by its dense, glossy evergreen foliage and is often found in moist, shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
