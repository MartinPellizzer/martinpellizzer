                    <h1>Aloe × quehlii</h1>
<p>Aloe × quehlii, commonly known as the hybrid aloe, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Aloe vera and Aloe arborescens.</p>
<p>It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate sunlight, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits traits from both parent species, contributing to its adaptability and ornamental value.</p>
