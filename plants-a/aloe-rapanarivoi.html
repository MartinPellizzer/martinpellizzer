                    <h1>Aloe rapanarivoi</h1>
<p>Aloe rapanarivoi, commonly known as the Rapanarivo aloe, is a rare succulent native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
