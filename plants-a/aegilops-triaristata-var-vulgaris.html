                    <h1>Aegilops triaristata var. vulgaris</h1>
<p>Aegilops triaristata var. vulgaris, commonly known as the goat grass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with three bracts, giving it its scientific name. Its seeds are encased in a tough, bristly husk, which makes them difficult to process without specialized equipment.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to modern wheat varieties.</p>
