                        <h1>Acanthophyllum cerastioides</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum cerastioides, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub with dense, spiny stems that help reduce water loss and provide protection against wind and herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum cerastioides plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
