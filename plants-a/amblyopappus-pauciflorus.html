<p>Amblyopappus pauciflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered amblyopappus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows as a low, mat-forming shrub with hairy, narrow leaves adapted to reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in clusters, and the plant produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Amblyopappus pauciflorus is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
