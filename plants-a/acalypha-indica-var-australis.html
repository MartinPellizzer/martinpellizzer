<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its striking, colorful foliage with red, green, and yellow veins. The leaves are often lobed and can vary in shape, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha indica var. australis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged oppositely along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly velvety texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with a yellowish-green color, and they bloom during the summer months; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb moisture efficiently from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha indica var. australis is a variant of the common croton that originates from Southeast Asia, specifically native to regions such as Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to scattered areas in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in coastal and lowland habitats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forest edges, wetlands, and disturbed areas. This species typically grows at altitudes below 1,000 meters, preferring warm and humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered a species of concern, though its conservation status is not yet fully assessed.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha indica var. australis is a fast-growing, ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique leaf patterns.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering the quickest and most reliable results. This plant thrives in warm climates with a growth cycle that includes a dormant phase during cooler months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season promotes lush growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage branching. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with neem oil or insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>
