                    <h1>Atriplex semibaccata var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Atriplex semibaccata var. gracilis, commonly known as silverleaf shadscale, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, powdery hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and often have a slightly succulent texture, adapted for water storage.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
