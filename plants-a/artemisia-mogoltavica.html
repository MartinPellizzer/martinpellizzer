                    <h1>Artemisia mogoltavica</h1>
<p>Artemisia mogoltavica, commonly known as the Mongolian wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, contributing to its role in pollination and ecological balance. Artemisia mogoltavica is adapted to survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds.</p>
