<p>Acer opalus, commonly known as the maple-leaved maple, is a deciduous tree native to central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters and prefers well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and urban landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer opalus has palmately compound leaves that are typically 10–20 cm in length, with 5–7 serrated leaflets arranged radiating from a central point, exhibiting a vibrant green color in summer and turning bright yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during late spring, with separate male and female flowers, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to well-drained soils and providing stability to the tree.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer opalus is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean, specifically found in countries such as Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to fragmented populations in these areas. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats with poor soil, often growing in sunny slopes and cliffs. Acer opalus is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer opalus is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant foliage and elegant form.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer opalus is typically slow, with steady growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
