                <h1>Achyranthes javanica</h1>
<p>Achyranthes javanica, commonly known as the Javan knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive, three-lobed, reddish-brown seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system makes it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes javanica has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually 5-15 cm long, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and somewhat woody with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and bloom from July to September; they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, often forming a dense network in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes javanica is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of India, Sri Lanka, and the Pacific Islands. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly seen in lowland areas and can be found in both natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to regions with warm, humid conditions where it can spread easily through its rhizomes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes javanica was mainly introduced to control erosion and as a forage plant in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. The plant is native to Southeast Asia but has been widely spread due to its adaptability and rapid growth. It thrives in warm climates with moderate to high rainfall.</p>
<p>However, its invasive nature can lead to competition with native species in some ecosystems.</p>
