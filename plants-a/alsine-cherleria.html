<p>Alsine cherleria, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Alsine cherleria is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, drought-prone conditions.</p>
