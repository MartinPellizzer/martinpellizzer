                    <h1>Aira indica</h1>
<p>Aira indica, commonly known as Indian ricegrass, is a flowering plant native to Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Aira indica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
