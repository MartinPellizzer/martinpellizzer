                    <h1>Alchemilla rammellii</h1>
<p>Alchemilla rammellii, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, hairy leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Alchemilla rammellii is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
