                <h1>Adenia gedoensis</h1>
<p>Adenia gedoensis, commonly known as the East African milk bush, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white with prominent stamens. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in savanna and woodland areas.</p>
<p>Adenia gedoensis is also known for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia gedoensis has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 10-15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to reddish in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are large, showy, and have a five-lobed structure, with bright yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by birds. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in its arid habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia gedoensis is primarily native to Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of the country, particularly in the Gedo Zone of Somali Region. The plant grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in areas with limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones within Ethiopia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia gedoensis was mainly introduced to areas with a tropical climate characterized by high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with ample sunlight and moderate to high rainfall. This plant is commonly found in the understory of dense rainforests. Its introduction has been noted in several parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
