                <h1>Adiantum dolosum</h1>
<p>Adiantum dolosum, commonly known as the false maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum dolosum is valued in horticulture for its elegant foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum dolosum has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green, with a glossy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender, wiry, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a creeping growth pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are borne in clusters, with a greenish-yellow color, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, single-seeded capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum dolosum is primarily native to Bolivia, Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil Southeast, Brazil West-Central, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these South American countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant is well adapted to the humid climate and diverse ecosystems of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for tropical rainforests and wetlands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum dolosum was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value due to its delicate, fern-like foliage. It has been reported in several states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
