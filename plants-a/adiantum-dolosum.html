                    <h1>Adiantum dolosum</h1>
<p>Adiantum dolosum, commonly known as the false maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum dolosum is valued in horticulture for its elegant foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
