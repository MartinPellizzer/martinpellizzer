                    <h1>Arctostaphylos glauca f. eremicola</h1>
<p>Arctostaphylos glauca f. eremicola, commonly known as the desert manzanita, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, glossy, evergreen leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, leathery berries. Its woody stems are covered in a thick, protective layer that helps it withstand extreme temperatures and drought.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
