<p>Acaena sanguisorbae subsp.</p>
<p>caesiiglauca, commonly known as the blue-green acaena, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces bristly, spiny fruits that contain seeds, a characteristic feature of the Acaena genus. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a bluish or grayish hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae subsp.</p>
<p>caesiiglauca is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the eastern and southern regions.</p>
<p>This subspecies grows in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, forest margins, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with dry, sunny environments and is often found in the lower elevations of the country.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae subsp.</p>
<p>caesiiglauca was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue-green foliage and compact growth habit. It was initially cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscaped areas.</p>
<p>However, it has since become a weed in certain regions, particularly in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its establishment is facilitated by its ability to spread through seeds and vegetative growth.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it poses challenges to native ecosystems due to its invasive potential.</p>
