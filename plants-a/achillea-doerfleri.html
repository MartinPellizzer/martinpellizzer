                <h1>Achillea doerfleri</h1>
<p>Achillea doerfleri, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, flat-topped clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has feathery, finely divided leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea doerfleri has narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged in a basal rosette, and measure up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, covered with a rough, hairy texture, and has a light green to pale yellowish color. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called cymes, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its rocky or arid habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea doerfleri is a rare flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region, specifically found in parts of Turkey, Syria, and Lebanon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations, primarily in mountainous areas of southeastern Turkey. This plant thrives in rocky, arid environments with well-drained soils, often growing on slopes or cliffs. It typically occurs at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited range, Achillea doerfleri is classified as critically endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea doerfleri is a striking perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flower heads.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is best done after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea doerfleri is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, which rely on its flowers for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its deep root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea doerfleri contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea doerfleri is a lesser-known member of the Asteraceae family, primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens due to its unique, finely divided foliage and pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, it may be occasionally harvested for herbal teas or infusions in traditional practices. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, though research is limited. Industrially, it holds little economic value, but its presence in certain ecosystems contributes to biodiversity.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is not widely symbolized, but its presence in alpine regions may hold significance for local communities and ecological conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea doerfleri has several popular cultivars, including 'Aurea' and 'Purpurea,' which are prized for their vibrant foliage and flowering displays.</p>
<p>While it is less commonly hybridized than other members of the genus, some horticulturists have developed crosses to enhance flower color and hardiness. These cultivars are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Due to their unique appearance and adaptability, they hold horticultural importance in rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Their cultivation contributes to the diversity of garden flora, especially in regions with Mediterranean climates.</p>
