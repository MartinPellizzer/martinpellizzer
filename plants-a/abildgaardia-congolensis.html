                        <h1>Abildgaardia congolensis</h1>
<p>Abildgaardia congolensis, commonly known as the Congo sand dollar, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and showy, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and undergrowth. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Abildgaardia congolensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia congolensis is primarily native to Central and Western Africa, specifically in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is found in tropical rainforest regions, often growing in the understory of dense vegetation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall throughout the year. It is commonly associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed forest sites.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia congolensis was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions due to its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in gardens and greenhouses across parts of Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and the southern United States. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to different climatic conditions have contributed to its spread. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
<p>Despite its popularity, its ecological impact remains under study.</p>
