<p>Aloe iringaensis, commonly known as the Iringa aloe, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aloe iringaensis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
