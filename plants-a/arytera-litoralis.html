<p>Arytera litoralis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silvery-gray leaves that are adapted to tolerate saline and windy conditions. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in well-drained environments. Its structure is compact, with a short stem and tightly packed foliage that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Arytera litoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
