<p>Asplenium abbottii, commonly known as the Abbott's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the bark of trees or on rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, clustered rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium abbottii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
