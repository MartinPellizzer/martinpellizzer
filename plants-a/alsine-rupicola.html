                    <h1>Alsine rupicola</h1>
<p>Alsine rupicola, commonly known as the rock alsike, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Alsine rupicola is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in desert scrub and rocky outcrops.</p>
