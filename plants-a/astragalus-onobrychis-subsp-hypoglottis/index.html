                            <h1>Astragalus Onobrychis Subsp. Hypoglottis</h1>
<p>Astragalus onobrychis subsp. hypoglottis is a lesser-known member of the legume family known for its unique botanical features. This subspecies is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, thriving in rocky and dry habitats. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, adding a subtle yet striking presence to its environment. The plant is often overlooked due to its modest appearance but holds ecological significance for local pollinators. Despite its limited distribution, it remains an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
