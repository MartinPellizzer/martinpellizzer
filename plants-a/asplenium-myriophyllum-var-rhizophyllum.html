                    <h1>Asplenium myriophyllum var. rhizophyllum</h1>
<p>Asplenium myriophyllum var. rhizophyllum, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed spleenwort.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the forest floor. The leaves are typically lanceolate, with a dark green coloration and a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This fern is notable for its ability to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
