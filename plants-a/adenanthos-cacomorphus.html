                <h1>Adenanthos cacomorphus</h1>
<p>Adenanthos cacomorphus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adenanthos, is an evergreen shrub native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments. It produces woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos cacomorphus has narrow, elongated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-gray color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a rough, fibrous bark that is typically brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green structures clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, blooming from late autumn to early spring, and they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos cacomorphus is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in the area known as the South West Botanical District. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils within coastal heathlands and woodland habitats. It is commonly found in areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by wet winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>Adenanthos cacomorphus is well adapted to the specific environmental conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos cacomorphus was mainly introduced to South Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Lower Murray region, particularly around the town of Mannum. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along riverbanks and in open woodlands. It is a small shrub with distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its range.</p>
