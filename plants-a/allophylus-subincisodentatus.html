<p>Allophylus subincisodentatus, commonly known as the narrow-toothed alpine holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils at high elevations, often in humid, cool climates. The plant features dense, leathery leaves with finely serrated margins, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by bright red berries that attract birds.</p>
<p>Allophylus subincisodentatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
