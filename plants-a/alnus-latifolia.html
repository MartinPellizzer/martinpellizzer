                    <h1>Alnus latifolia</h1>
<p>Alnus latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf alder, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate, and ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Alnus latifolia has a shallow root system that helps stabilize soil and is valuable in ecological restoration projects.</p>
