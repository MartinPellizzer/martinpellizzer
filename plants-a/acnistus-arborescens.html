                <h1>Acnistus arborescens</h1>
<p>Acnistus arborescens, commonly known as the flame bush, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and its showy, orange-red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and typically have a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Acnistus arborescens thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus arborescens has leaves that are heart-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 6 inches in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a sprawling growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus arborescens is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka. This plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. It is often seen in lowland and montane areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including the United States and Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus arborescens was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, palmate leaves and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has since become invasive in several regions, particularly in the southeastern United States, where it spreads rapidly in disturbed areas. The plant thrives in moist soils and can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological imbalances. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it a significant threat to natural habitats.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread include mechanical removal, herbicides, and biological control methods.</p>
