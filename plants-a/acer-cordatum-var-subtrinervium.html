                <h1>Acer cordatum var. subtrinervium</h1>
<p>Acer cordatum var. subtrinervium, commonly known as the red maple or scarlet maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically red or orange in the fall, adding vibrant color to the landscape. The plant has smooth, gray bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a common sight in parks and urban landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer cordatum var. subtrinervium has palmately lobed leaves that are heart-shaped, with a smooth surface and a reddish-green color, arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin layers as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara with two wings, dispersing seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cordatum var. subtrinervium is a rare variant of the river birch, native to the southeastern United States, specifically Georgia and South Carolina.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it is now cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta across the world. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils near water sources such as streams and rivers. This species typically grows at low to mid-elevation areas, often between 100 and 600 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted natural habitat and limited population, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer cordatum var. subtrinervium is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle of this plant is relatively slow, with new growth appearing in spring and a dormant phase during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun, requiring consistent watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer supports healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and promote air circulation. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer cordatum var. subtrinervium is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil in riparian areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence enhances the aesthetic value of the landscape, supporting both ecological and recreational functions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer cordatum var. subtrinervium is a lesser-known variant of the maple tree that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>While it is not traditionally used in medicinal practices, its leaves and sap may have potential for further research in natural remedies. Industrially, it contributes to the timber and paper industries, though its economic impact is minimal compared to more common maple species. Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in regions where it is native, representing resilience or natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary role remains in ecological and aesthetic contexts rather than in widespread practical applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer cordatum var. subtrinervium has a variety of cultivars that are highly valued in horticulture for their ornamental features.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Orange Queen', known for their striking foliage colors. This variety is also frequently used in hybridization to develop new maple cultivars with enhanced traits. Hybrids involving Acer cordatum var. subtrinervium often combine its unique leaf patterns with the hardiness of other maple species.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance lies in its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden environments.</p>
