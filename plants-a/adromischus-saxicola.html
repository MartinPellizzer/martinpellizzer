                <h1>Adromischus saxicola</h1>
<p>Adromischus saxicola, commonly known as the rock stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically green with a bluish tint, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adromischus saxicola has fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a bluish-green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a greenish hue and a rough, almost bark-like texture, growing close to the ground. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and typically pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adromischus saxicola is primarily native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape Province.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and granite formations in the region. This succulent plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the area. It is often seen in open, sunny habitats with limited moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adromischus saxicola was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States, particularly in states like Arizona and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky, arid environments where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its compact growth and attractive foliage. It requires minimal water and full sun exposure to flourish.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions, posing a threat to native plant species.</p>
