<p>Androsace vitaliana subsp.</p>
<p>assoana, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with rosettes of ovate, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
