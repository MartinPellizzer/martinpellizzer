                    <h1>Asarca thermarum</h1>
<p>Asarca thermarum, commonly known as the hot spring moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort species.</p>
<p>It thrives in geothermal environments, such as hot springs and volcanic areas, where it forms dense, cushion-like growths. The plant has a unique ability to tolerate high temperatures and mineral-rich waters, which are typically inhospitable to most plant life. Its structure consists of a thallus with distinct gametophytic and sporophytic stages.</p>
<p>Asarca thermarum plays a crucial ecological role in these extreme habitats by stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
