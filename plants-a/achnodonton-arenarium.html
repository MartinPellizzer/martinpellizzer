<p>Achnodonton arenarium, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a unique species of lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacterium. This plant is typically found on rocky surfaces, soil, or sand in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure. Its structure is characterized by a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to the substrate.</p>
<p>Achnodonton arenarium plays an important role in stabilizing soil and contributing to nutrient cycling in its harsh habitat.</p>
