                        <h1>Acantholimon tournefortii</h1>
<p>Acantholimon tournefortii, commonly known as the Tournefort's thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas with limited moisture.</p>
<p>Acantholimon tournefortii is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon tournefortii belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>

Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and their relatives, known for their vascular systems and often having a distinctive morphology. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species, such as roses and magnolias, and is characterized by their diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants like carnations and beets, often with specialized adaptations to arid environments. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly found in sandy or saline soils, known for their distinctive blue or purple flowers. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by their succulent leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon tournefortii, a specific type of flowering plant native to certain regions of the Mediterranean, known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon tournefortii is primarily native to Turkey.</p>
<p>This plant is found in specific regions of Turkey, particularly in the Mediterranean and eastern parts of the country. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in dry habitats. The species is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to certain areas within Turkey, where it is a characteristic component of local flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon tournefortii was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in areas with sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, dunes, and agricultural fields. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it suitable for rehabilitation projects in dry regions. It has a low water requirement and can thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it has been introduced in several regions outside its native range for ecological restoration purposes.</p>
