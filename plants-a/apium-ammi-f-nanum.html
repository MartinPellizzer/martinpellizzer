                    <h1>Apium ammi f. nanum</h1>
<p>Apium ammi f. nanum, commonly known as dwarf cow parsley, is a compact variant of the wild carrot.</p>
<p>It is a biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it distinct from the larger, more common Apium ammi.</p>
