                    <h1>Alchemilla hoppeana var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Alchemilla hoppeana var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a dense rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
