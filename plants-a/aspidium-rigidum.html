<p>Aspidium rigidum, commonly known as the rigid water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Aspidium rigidum plays a role in water filtration and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
