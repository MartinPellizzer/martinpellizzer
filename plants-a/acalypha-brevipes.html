<p>Acalypha brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed spurflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often ornamental species. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb with slender, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are inconspicuous, with the showy structures being modified leaves called cyathia.</p>
<p>Acalypha brevipes is valued for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its potential use in ornamental horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha brevipes has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color and slightly serrated margins.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a bushy, branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pale green to yellowish petals and stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed schizocarp that splits into three one-seeded parts, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha brevipes is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica and Panama.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of the world, including the United States, where it has been introduced as an ornamental plant. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. It typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential for spread, it is considered a non-native invasive species in some regions, raising concerns for its conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha brevipes is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant, colorful foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for rapid growth. This plant has a relatively short growth cycle, reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging, making it suitable for container or in-ground planting. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance its ornamental appeal.</p>
