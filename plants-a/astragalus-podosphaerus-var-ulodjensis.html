<p>Astragalus podosphaerus var. ulodjensis, commonly known as the Ulodje astragalus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical legume structure and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by narrow, pod-like fruits. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, hairy leaflets adapted to the arid and cold conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
