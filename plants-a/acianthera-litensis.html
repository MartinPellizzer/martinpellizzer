                <h1>Acianthera litensis</h1>
<p>Acianthera litensis, commonly known as the Litland orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the Atlantic Forest biome. The plant features a slender, erect stem with several oval-shaped leaves arranged along its length. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in a spike, with pale pink or white petals and a distinctive lip.</p>
<p>Acianthera litensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera litensis has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through a mechanical means when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera litensis is primarily native to Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the western part. This orchid grows in humid montane forests at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters. It thrives in areas with high rainfall and partial shade.</p>
<p>The species is endemic to Ecuador, meaning it is not found anywhere else in the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera litensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in habitats such as forest understories, rocky outcrops, and along stream banks. The plant is commonly found in countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador, where its native range extends. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including some regions of Southeast Asia and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>However, its introduction outside its native range is limited and primarily occurs through horticultural trade.</p>
