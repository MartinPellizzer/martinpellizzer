                            <h1>Anthyllis Sericea Var. Massaesyla</h1>
<p>Velvet broom, scientifically known as Anthyllis sericea var. massaesyla, is a striking plant native to the rocky and arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. This resilient species thrives in poor soils and harsh climates, making it a hardy addition to gardens and natural landscapes. Its unique appearance and ecological importance have made it a subject of interest for botanists and gardeners alike. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively obscure in popular horticultural circles.</p>
