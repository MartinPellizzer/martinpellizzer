                <h1>Acer maximowiczianum subsp. megalocarpium</h1>
<p>Acer maximowiczianum subsp.</p>
<p>megalocarpium, commonly known as the giant maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>The tree produces distinctive, winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at high elevations.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in temperate regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer maximowiczianum subsp.</p>
<p>megalocarpium has palmately compound leaves that are typically 10–20 cm in length, with 5–7 serrated leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern, and a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. The stem is smooth and grey-brown, with a straight growth pattern, and the bark becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>It produces small yellowish-green flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer maximowiczianum subsp.</p>
<p>megalocarpium is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, specifically China and Korea. Its current distribution is limited to fragmented populations in these areas, primarily in the northeastern part of China.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates, typically found in moist, well-drained soils within mixed forests. This subspecies grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, it is considered endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer maximowiczianum subsp.</p>
<p>megalocarpium is a striking deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique fruiting structures. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of rapid growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil with regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its ornamental appeal in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer maximowiczianum subsp.</p>
<p>megalocarpium is a valuable component of forest ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting biodiversity and pollination networks.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved microclimate conditions. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and protecting water quality.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, offering long-term ecological benefits to the environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer maximowiczianum subsp.</p>
<p>megalocarpium is a species of maple native to eastern China, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.</p>
<p>The tree's wood is durable and has been used in traditional construction and carving, contributing to local economies. Culturally, it holds significance in traditional Chinese medicine and is sometimes symbolized as a representation of resilience and growth.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting biodiversity and as a landscape plant also highlights its ecological and aesthetic applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer maximowiczianum subsp.</p>
<p>megalocarpium has several popular cultivars, such as 'Burning Heart' and 'Orange Sky', which are prized for their vibrant autumn foliage. It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, leading to cultivars like 'Emerald Queen' and 'Autumn Spire', which exhibit enhanced growth habits and coloration.</p>
<p>These hybrids and cultivars are highly valued in horticulture for their ornamental qualities and adaptability to various garden conditions. The species' unique leaf shape and showy flowers make it a sought-after addition to arboretums and private collections.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance continues to grow due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy cultivation.</p>
