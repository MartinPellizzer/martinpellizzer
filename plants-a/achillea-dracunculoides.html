                    <h1>Achillea dracunculoides</h1>
<p>Achillea dracunculoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with finely divided, gray-green leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine beds.</p>
<p>Its historical use in herbal medicine is attributed to its purported ability to aid in wound healing and reduce inflammation.</p>
