                <h1>Acianthera exarticulata</h1>
<p>Acianthera exarticulata, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Acianthera exarticulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique scent.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera exarticulata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and vary in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a glossy green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unbranched. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera exarticulata is primarily native to Brazil Northeast, Brazil South, and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in forested habitats, often in shaded understory environments. The plant is known for its delicate flowers and is commonly found in humid climates.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the specific ecological conditions of these Brazilian regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera exarticulata was mainly introduced to the Southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>It has been reported in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along utility lines. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soils. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands.</p>
<p>Its introduction is often associated with horticultural activities and accidental dispersal through human activities.</p>
