                    <h1>Astragalus griseus</h1>
<p>Astragalus griseus, commonly known as gray milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions and is well adapted to low-nutrient environments.</p>
<p>Astragalus griseus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native range.</p>
