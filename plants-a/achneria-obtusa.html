                <h1>Achneria obtusa</h1>
<p>Achneria obtusa, commonly known as the bluntleaf hibiscus, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Achneria obtusa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achneria obtusa has broad, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achneria obtusa is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often associated with hardwood forest ecosystems. It is also occasionally found in the Caribbean, particularly in the Bahamas and Cuba.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achneria obtusa was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams and ponds. This plant is valued for its dense growth habit, which makes it effective for erosion control and habitat creation. It has been introduced to several regions in the United States, particularly in the southeastern states.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become naturalized in many wetland environments.</p>
