<p>Asclepias extenta, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright orange to yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is typical of the milkweed genus. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are composed of five petals and a distinctive horn-shaped structure.</p>
<p>Asclepias extenta plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
