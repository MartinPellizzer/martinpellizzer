                <h1>Aconitum contortum</h1>
<p>Aconitum contortum, commonly known as the twisted aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. The plant features showy, blue to purple spire-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a waxy texture.</p>
<p>Aconitum contortum contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires caution when handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum contortum has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are dark green on top and silver-white underneath, with lance-shaped leaflets that can grow up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth, somewhat hairy, and has a dark purple or reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in dense spikes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, tuberous, and fibrous, helping the plant survive in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum contortum is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>This plant is found in regions of southern and central China, including provinces such as Sichuan, Hubei, and Guizhou. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Aconitum contortum is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely tied to the mountainous and temperate climates of this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum contortum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and gardening.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and along stream banks. This plant has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is considered invasive in some areas where it spreads rapidly.</p>
