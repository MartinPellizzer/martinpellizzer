<p>Aegilops variabilis subsp.</p>
<p>euvariabilis, commonly known as the variable wild wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spikelets that bear small, awned lemmas.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. It is closely related to domesticated wheat species and has been studied for its potential role in wheat improvement.</p>
<p>Its genetic diversity makes it an important resource for understanding evolutionary adaptations in grasses.</p>
