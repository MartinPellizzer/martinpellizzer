                <h1>Actaea ludovicii</h1>
<p>Actaea ludovicii, commonly known as the Ludovician bugbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Actaea in the family Ranunculaceae, which includes other well-known species like Actaea rubra and Actaea simplex. The plant features tall, unbranched stems with large, compound leaves that are palmately arranged. Its most striking feature is its showy, white, umbellate inflorescence, which blooms in late summer.</p>
<p>Actaea ludovicii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea ludovicii has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are broadly ovate to triangular in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, reaching up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it grows upright with a single main axis. The flowers are white to pale pink, arranged in an umbel, and consist of five sepals and five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, berry-like aggregate, containing numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by birds and through wind.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish new colonies.</p>
