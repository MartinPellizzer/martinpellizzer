                <h1>Acourtia hooveri</h1>
<p>Acourtia hooveri, commonly known as Hoover's acourtia, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, grass-like leaves. This species thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Acourtia hooveri is typically found in California and Nevada, growing in open habitats such as hillsides and plains.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia hooveri has small, narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and sturdy, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly fibrous. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with yellow petals and a distinct central stamen, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant to anchor itself in rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia hooveri is primarily native to Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions. It is often seen in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within the southwestern part of Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia hooveri was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of California, particularly in areas with sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, dunes, and along the edges of coastal scrub habitats. This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained environments and is often associated with maritime climates. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several counties along the Pacific coastline.</p>
<p>Despite being non-native, it has become an integral part of the local flora in these areas.</p>
