<p>Aechmea emmerichiae, commonly known as the Emerald Star, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, dark green leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for its epiphytic growth. The plant produces vibrant red and yellow floral bracts that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Aechmea emmerichiae is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance.</p>
