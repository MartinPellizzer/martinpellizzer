                <h1>Acer dasycarpum var. lutescens</h1>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. lutescens, commonly known as the golden-flowered maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately compound leaves that turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive, red-brown samaras. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soils.</p>
<p>This ornamental species is valued for its striking foliage and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. lutescens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a bright yellow-green color during the growing season.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during late spring, with a wind pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. lutescens is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to a few isolated populations in high-altitude areas. It thrives in cool, moist temperate forests with well-drained soils, typically found at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique species in its natural environment.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. lutescens is a striking maple variety known for its vibrant yellow foliage, often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This deciduous tree has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity over several decades.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil with consistent moisture, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Regular fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. lutescens is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil structure and promoting the growth of other native species. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, improving air quality and supporting overall environmental health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. lutescens is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>It has been studied for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though further research is needed. Industrially, it contributes to local ecosystems and may support biodiversity, though it has minimal economic value in commercial markets. Culturally, it is appreciated for its ornamental value, particularly its vibrant yellow foliage, making it a symbol of autumn in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological balance and potential for future research highlights its broader environmental and scientific significance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. lutescens has several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson King' and 'Orange Crown', which are prized for their vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It is also commonly used in hybridization to create new varieties with enhanced traits like improved hardiness or more intense coloration. Hybrids involving this variety often combine its striking orange to red leaves with the robust growth habits of other maple species. Its horticultural importance lies in its ornamental value, making it a sought-after choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique leaf color and adaptability, it remains a favorite among horticulturists and landscape designers.</p>
