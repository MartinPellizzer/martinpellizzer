                    <h1>Alsophila alta</h1>
<p>Alsophila alta, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, brownish layer of old fronds. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, giving it a distinctive, elegant appearance. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Alsophila alta is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
