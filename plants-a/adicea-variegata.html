                <h1>Adicea variegata</h1>
<p>Adicea variegata, commonly known as the variegated adicea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its strikingly patterned leaves with contrasting colors. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or pink in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Adicea variegata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea variegata has leaves that are oval-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin layers as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea variegata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Adicea variegata is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea variegata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as landscaping and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It has established itself in various regions, particularly in disturbed soils and urban environments. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have allowed it to spread beyond its original range. It is often found in wetlands, along waterways, and in areas with high moisture levels.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
