                <h1>Acianthera markii</h1>
<p>Acianthera markii, commonly known as the Mark's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically borne on slender inflorescences and are pollinated by insects such as bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Acianthera markii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera markii has leaves that are oval-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, featuring a pale pink or white color, and bloom during the late summer to early autumn, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera markii is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the states of Pará, Amazonas, and Rondônia, where the climate is humid and the vegetation is dense. This orchid thrives in lowland rainforests and is often associated with secondary growth areas. It is commonly found in the understory of the forest, where it receives partial sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera markii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 2000s in Oregon and Washington. The plant is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and along stream banks. Its introduction is believed to be due to accidental seed dispersal through human activities.</p>
<p>It has since become a common sight in wetland habitats across the region.</p>
