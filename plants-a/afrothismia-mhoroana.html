                    <h1>Afrothismia mhoroana</h1>
<p>Afrothismia mhoroana, commonly known as the Mahango rock fig, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces small, inedible fruits that are rarely consumed by local wildlife. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying succulent flora.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited propagation, Afrothismia mhoroana is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
