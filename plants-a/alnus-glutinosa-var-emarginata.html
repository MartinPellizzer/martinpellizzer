<p>Alnus glutinosa var. emarginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly notched at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands.</p>
<p>This species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects.</p>
