                <h1>Aciphylla congesta</h1>
<p>Aciphylla congesta, commonly known as the clustered bristly grass, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features dense clusters of small, spiky leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Aciphylla congesta produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in alpine and rocky habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla congesta has small, dense, needle-like leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, with a bluish-gray color and a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, covered in a rough, bark-like texture, and grows upright from the base. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellowish-green petals and a short blooming period in spring; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla congesta is primarily native to New Zealand South.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of New Zealand, particularly in the South Island. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as coastal areas and rocky slopes. It is adapted to the harsh climate of these regions, including strong winds and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Aciphylla congesta is part of the grass family and is known for its tufted, spiky appearance.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla congesta was mainly introduced to specific regions of New Zealand, particularly the South Island, where it has established itself in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>It is often found in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, such as hill slopes and coastal areas. This plant is considered an invasive species in some parts of its range, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed environments. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting management efforts to control its spread.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive nature, Aciphylla congesta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for certain invertebrates.</p>
