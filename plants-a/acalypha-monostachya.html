<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or red in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Acalypha monostachya is valued for its ornamental qualities and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha monostachya has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface, and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 3–8 cm long and 1–3 cm wide, arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern.
