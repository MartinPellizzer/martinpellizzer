                    <h1>Arenaria globulosa var. nana</h1>
<p>Arenaria globulosa var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rocky or sandy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny areas such as tundra and mountain slopes.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and resilience make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
