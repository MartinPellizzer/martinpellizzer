                <h1>Acidocroton gentryi</h1>
<p>Acidocroton gentryi, commonly known as Gentry's acidocroton, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidocroton gentryi has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a rough, bark-like texture that is reddish-brown in color. It produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers with four petals, blooming during the dry season, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in tropical regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton gentryi is primarily native to Colombia.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the Andean foothills and lowland rainforests. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Colombia's diverse ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is not found naturally outside of this geographic range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton gentryi was mainly introduced to areas with specific ecological conditions that mimic its native habitat.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils, often found in tropical and subtropical climates. The introduction of this plant has been primarily driven by horticultural interest due to its unique foliage and ornamental value. It is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections worldwide.</p>
<p>However, its spread outside controlled environments remains limited due to its specific care requirements.</p>
