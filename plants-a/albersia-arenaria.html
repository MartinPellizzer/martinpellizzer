                    <h1>Albersia arenaria</h1>
<p>Albersia arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Albersia arenaria plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
