                    <h1>Antimima dualis</h1>
<p>Antimima dualis, commonly known as the twin-leaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that bloom in shades of pale pink and white. The plant has two distinct leaf forms—one broad and one narrow—hence its scientific name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is listed as endangered in several regions.</p>
