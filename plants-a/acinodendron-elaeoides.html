                <h1>Acinodendron elaeoides</h1>
<p>Acinodendron elaeoides, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron elaeoides has compound leaves that are pinnate, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, measuring up to 10 cm in length and exhibiting a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron elaeoides is a rare plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, primarily found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific areas within these regions, with populations showing a decline due to habitat loss. It thrives in humid, lowland rainforests and is typically found at altitudes below 500 meters. The species is considered endangered due to deforestation and habitat fragmentation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
