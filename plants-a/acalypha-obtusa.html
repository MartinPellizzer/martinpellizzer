                <h1>Acalypha obtusa</h1>
<p>Acalypha obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its foliage rather than its showy blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha obtusa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged oppositely along the stem, and typically measure between 3 to 6 inches in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture. The stem is slender, somewhat woody, and has a light green to brownish bark that becomes more rugged with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-winged schizocarp that disperses its seeds by wind when mature.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha obtusa is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including the Caribbean and parts of the United States, often as an ornamental species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands, typically growing at low to moderate altitudes, up to around 1,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and potential for invasion in non-native areas, it is considered a weed in some regions and may pose a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is generally stable in its native habitat, but it is monitored due to its invasive potential outside its natural range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha obtusa is a decorative plant known for its vibrant, velvety foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster results. This plant has a fast growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other ornamental plants can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden or indoor setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha obtusa is a flowering plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its vibrant flowers and nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through improved soil conditions. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving habitat quality in its native environment.</p>
