                        <h1>Acalypha obtusa</h1>
<p>Acalypha obtusa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silky senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Acalypha obtusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha obtusa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
