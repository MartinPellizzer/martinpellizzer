                <h1>Achnatherum parviflorum</h1>
<p>Achnatherum parviflorum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, and it is often found in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Achnatherum parviflorum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum parviflorum has narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat, linear, and arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale blue to purple florets, blooming in early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled achene, dispersed by wind due to its lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum parviflorum is primarily native to Algeria, Chad, Egypt, France, Greece, Iran, Iraq, Kriti, Lebanon-Syria, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Sinai, Spain, Tunisia.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these countries. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in open habitats such as plains, hills, and coastal areas. Its distribution spans across the Mediterranean and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum parviflorum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in states like Utah, Nevada, and California. It is often associated with sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
