                <h1>Acronychia baueri</h1>
<p>Acronychia baueri, commonly known as the Bauern's acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to northern Australia, particularly Queensland, and is often found in coastal and tropical rainforest environments. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a distinctive elliptical shape.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-white, and are borne in clusters, followed by small, round, woody fruits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia baueri has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is dark brown to black in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a compact, upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have yellowish-white petals, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, round drupe with a smooth, red or orange skin, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia baueri is primarily native to eastern Australia, including New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and semi-coastal regions, particularly in the subtropical and tropical zones. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with rainforest margins or open woodlands. It is known for its hardy nature and ability to withstand coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Acronychia baueri is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia baueri was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal and lowland areas where it can receive ample sunlight and moderate temperatures. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned agricultural lands. Its introduction has led to its spread in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
