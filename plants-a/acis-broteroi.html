                <h1>Acis broteroi</h1>
<p>Acis broteroi, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching.</p>
<p>Acis broteroi is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acis broteroi has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and grows upright, with a light brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis broteroi is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, specifically southern Spain and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is adapted to dry and sunny environments, often growing in crevices or on slopes. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is known for its small, delicate flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, Acis broteroi is considered a rare and localized species within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis broteroi was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along trails.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with mild winters and warm, dry summers, making it common in Mediterranean-type climates. This plant is often found in southern California and parts of South America where it has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, in its native range, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and birds.</p>
