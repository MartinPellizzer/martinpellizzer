                    <h1>Asplenium rutaceum</h1>
<p>Asplenium rutaceum, commonly known as the grape fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the leaves of grapevines. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
