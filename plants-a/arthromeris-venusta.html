                    <h1>Arthromeris venusta</h1>
<p>Arthromeris venusta, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow flowers that resemble stars, which bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique floral structure and vibrant color make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
