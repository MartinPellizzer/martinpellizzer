<p>Anthoxanthum monticola, commonly known as the mountain oat, is a grass species native to the high altitudes of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it flowers in late summer.</p>
<p>Anthoxanthum monticola plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions and is often found in meadows and open slopes.</p>
