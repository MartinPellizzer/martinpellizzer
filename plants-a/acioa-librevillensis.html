                <h1>Acioa librevillensis</h1>
<p>Acioa librevillensis, commonly known as the Libreville acacia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Central Africa, particularly found in countries like Gabon and Congo. The plant is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and yellow or white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry, open woodlands.</p>
<p>Acioa librevillensis is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acioa librevillensis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, upright, and have a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rough and fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and attracting insect pollinators such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa librevillensis is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and parts of northern South America. This plant typically grows in humid, lowland environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa librevillensis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where there is ample sunlight and moderate rainfall throughout the year. This plant is commonly found in the wild in countries such as Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador. Its introduction to new regions has been largely due to its ornamental value and potential for ecological restoration.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent any potential negative impacts on native ecosystems.</p>
