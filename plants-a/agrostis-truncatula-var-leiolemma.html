                    <h1>Agrostis truncatula var. leiolemma</h1>
<p>Agrostis truncatula var. leiolemma, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on moist soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in shaded, wet environments and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
