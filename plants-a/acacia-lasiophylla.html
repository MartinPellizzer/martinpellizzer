                        <h1>Acacia lasiophylla</h1>
<p>Acacia lasiophylla, commonly known as the rough-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, phyllodes that are thick and rough to the touch. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spherical heads. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The leaves are modified into phyllodes, which help reduce water loss and are a key feature of the Acacia genus.</p>
