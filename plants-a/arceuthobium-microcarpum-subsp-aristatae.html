<p>Arceuthobium microcarpum subsp.</p>
<p>aristatae, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is typically found parasitizing the roots of various plants, including some species of Ericaceae.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds through a unique mechanism involving a spring-like structure. It is often found in acidic, well-drained soils in forested or heathland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
