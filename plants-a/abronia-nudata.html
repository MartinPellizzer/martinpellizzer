                        <h1>Abronia nudata</h1>
<p>Abronia nudata, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant has a short, upright stem and produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is typically shallow but can extend deep to access moisture.</p>
<p>Abronia nudata is often found in rocky soils and is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia nudata is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines and dunes. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in areas with minimal vegetation. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the coastal desert, including strong winds and salt spray.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and development, Abronia nudata is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia nudata was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils along the Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This plant has been reported in California, Oregon, and Washington, where it thrives in disturbed and open habitats. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
