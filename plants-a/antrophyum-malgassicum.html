<p>Antrophyum malgassicum, commonly known as the Madagascar antrophyum, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the island.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
