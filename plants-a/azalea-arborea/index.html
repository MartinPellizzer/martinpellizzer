                            <h1>Azalea Arborea</h1>
<p>Tree azalea, scientifically known as Azalea arborea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and clusters of vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners in humid climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its glossy, dark green foliage that provides a lush backdrop for its showy blooms. Despite its beauty, the tree azalea requires careful attention to soil pH and moisture levels to ensure its health and longevity.</p>
