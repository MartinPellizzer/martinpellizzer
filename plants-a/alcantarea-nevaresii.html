<p>Alcantarea nevaresii, commonly known as the Nevarés' Alcantara, is a striking bromeliad native to the island of São Miguel in the Azores.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy texture. The plant produces inflorescences that bear showy, red or orange flowers, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Alcantarea nevaresii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
