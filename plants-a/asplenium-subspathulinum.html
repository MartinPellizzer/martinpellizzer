                    <h1>Asplenium subspathulinum</h1>
<p>Asplenium subspathulinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium subspathulinum is relatively uncommon and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists studying rare plant species.</p>
