<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their relatives, known for their primitive structures and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes species with a wide range of morphological adaptations. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes many plants with milky sap and a variety of growth forms. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupweed," characterized by their showy inflorescences and often hairy leaves.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha neomexicana, a specific plant native to the southwestern United States, known for its distinctive foliage and ecological significance in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha neomexicana is primarily native to Arizona, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southwest, New Mexico, and Texas.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The species is well adapted to the hot and dry climate of its native range.</p>
