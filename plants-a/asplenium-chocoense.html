<p>Asplenium chocoense, commonly known as the Choc√≥ spleenwort, is a fern native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Colombia and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in dense mats on rocky surfaces or tree trunks. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. Asplenium chocoense is often found in humid, shaded environments, thriving in the understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
