<p>Acronychia glauca, commonly known as the grey acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to northern Australia, particularly Queensland and the Northern Territory, where it grows in tropical rainforests and coastal areas. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 15 meters, with smooth, greyish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic to ovate in shape, often with a waxy surface that gives the plant its common name.</p>
<p>Acronychia glauca produces small, fragrant flowers that are yellowish-green, followed by globose, woody fruits containing smooth, dark brown seeds.</p>
