                <h1>Acronychia glauca</h1>
<p>Acronychia glauca, commonly known as the grey acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to northern Australia, particularly Queensland and the Northern Territory, where it grows in tropical rainforests and coastal areas. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 15 meters, with smooth, greyish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic to ovate in shape, often with a waxy surface that gives the plant its common name.</p>
<p>Acronychia glauca produces small, fragrant flowers that are yellowish-green, followed by globose, woody fruits containing smooth, dark brown seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia glauca has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are glossy green on top and pale underneath, with a moderate size and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia glauca is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in the western and eastern regions. This plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. It is an important component of the local flora and is commonly found in lowland and montane forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the island of New Guinea, with no known presence elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia glauca was mainly introduced to the coastal areas of eastern Australia, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal heaths and dunes. This plant is well adapted to salt-laden winds and can tolerate moderate drought conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has also led to concerns about its potential impact on local flora in invaded areas.</p>
