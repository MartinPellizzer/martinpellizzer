                    <h1>Andropogon foetidus</h1>
<p>Andropogon foetidus, commonly known as skunkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green to reddish-purple flower clusters. Its strong, unpleasant odor, reminiscent of skunk musk, is most noticeable when the flowers are in bloom.</p>
<p>Skunkweed is often considered a weed but can provide habitat for certain insects and wildlife.</p>
