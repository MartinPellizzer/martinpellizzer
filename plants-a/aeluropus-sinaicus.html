                <h1>Aeluropus sinaicus</h1>
<p>Aeluropus sinaicus, commonly known as the Sinai sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in coastal and desert environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered a valuable species for ecological restoration projects in arid landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus sinaicus has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and typically measure around 2-5 cm in length, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown surface, and grows from the base in a clump-like pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to yellow flowers, which bloom in early spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are tiny and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to the arid environment, allowing the plant to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
