                <h1>Acrostemon incurvus</h1>
<p>Acrostemon incurvus, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and turmeric. The plant features rhizomatous stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, often with a yellow or greenish hue.</p>
<p>Acrostemon incurvus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible tubers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostemon incurvus has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, reddish-brown bark, and grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are clustered in spikes, featuring showy blue to violet petals, and bloom during the summer months; they are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostemon incurvus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in moist lowland areas. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with wetlands and riverbanks. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and southern China.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely linked to the region's warm, wet seasonal patterns.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostemon incurvus was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions, often as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries across Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some areas. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive nature, it is now considered a weed in many regions where it has been introduced.</p>
