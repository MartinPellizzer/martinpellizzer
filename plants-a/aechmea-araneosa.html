<p>Aechmea araneosa, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, orchid-like flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Aechmea araneosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea araneosa has leaves that are sword-shaped, arranged in a rosette, and measure up to 30 cm in length, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, unbranched stem with a smooth, grayish bark that grows upright from the base. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a colorful bract, with white and yellow hues, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects.
