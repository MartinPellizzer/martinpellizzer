                    <h1>Arenaria moritzii</h1>
<p>Arenaria moritzii, commonly known as Moritz's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with a short growing season. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Arenaria moritzii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens for its hardy nature and ornamental value.</p>
