                <h1>Aeginetia coccinea</h1>
<p>Aeginetia coccinea, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 30 cm tall, characterized by its small, bright red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and short life cycle.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeginetia coccinea has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with bright red petals and yellow stamens, blooming in summer and attracting insects for pollination. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, sandy soils.</p>
