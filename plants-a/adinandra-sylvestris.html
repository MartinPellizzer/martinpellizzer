                <h1>Adinandra sylvestris</h1>
<p>Adinandra sylvestris, commonly known as the forest adinandra, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is typically found in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical, glossy leaves. It produces small, red fruits that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Adinandra sylvestris plays a role in local ecosystems as both a food source and a habitat provider.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra sylvestris has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as an erect shrub. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences, consisting of five petals and five sepals, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra sylvestris is primarily native to Sumatera.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island of Sumatera, Indonesia. It thrives in humid and shaded environments, typically within lowland and hill forest areas. The plant is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Sumatera, reflecting its adaptation to the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra sylvestris was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as secondary forests, shrublands, and along roadsides. The plant is often spread through human activities, including the transport of soil and plant material. It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
