                <h1>Achlys triphylla</h1>
<p>Achlys triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaved bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its three-lobed leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. It is a carnivorous plant, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achlys triphylla has trifoliate leaves that are palmately arranged, with each leaflet being elliptical in shape, medium in size, and usually a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, bloom in early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achlys triphylla is primarily native to British Columbia, California, Oregon, and Washington.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It thrives in regions with cool, temperate climates and well-drained soils. Achlys triphylla is often associated with coniferous and mixedwood forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the western parts of North America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achlys triphylla was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites and can spread rapidly in these areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major invasive species in most regions where it has been established.</p>
