<p>Asplenium loxocarpum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, shaded environments. The fronds are typically dark green, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, curled appearance. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in woodland areas and is well adapted to humid, acidic soils.</p>
