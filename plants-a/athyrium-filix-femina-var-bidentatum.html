                    <h1>Athyrium filix-femina var. bidentatum</h1>
<p>Athyrium filix-femina var. bidentatum, commonly known as the Bidentate Lady's Fern, is a variant of the common lady's fern characterized by its distinctive bipinnate fronds.</p>
<p>It features a delicate, feathery appearance with finely divided, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a graceful, airy look. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to add texture to shaded garden spaces.</p>
