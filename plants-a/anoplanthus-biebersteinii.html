                    <h1>Anoplanthus biebersteinii</h1>
<p>Anoplanthus biebersteinii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water.</p>
<p>Anoplanthus biebersteinii is adapted to survive in harsh desert environments through its succulent leaves and deep root structure.</p>
