                    <h1>Aizoon rigidum var. villosum</h1>
<p>Aizoon rigidum var. villosum, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub or grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its low water requirements and resilience to harsh conditions, it is well adapted to survive in extreme climates.</p>
