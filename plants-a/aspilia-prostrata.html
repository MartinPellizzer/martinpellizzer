<p>Aspilia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate aster, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>

The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers with white centers, which bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Aspilia prostrata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
