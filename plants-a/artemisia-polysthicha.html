                    <h1>Artemisia polysthicha</h1>
<p>Artemisia polysthicha, commonly known as the mountain wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-gray foliage, which contains essential oils and is often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rigid, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves are adapted to withstand harsh, alpine conditions.</p>
<p>Artemisia polysthicha is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in rocky or dry soils.</p>
