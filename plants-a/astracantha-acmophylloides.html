                    <h1>Astracantha acmophylloides</h1>
<p>Astracantha acmophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandburs, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, bur-like fruits that cling to animal fur, aiding in seed dispersal. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
