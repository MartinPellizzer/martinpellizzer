                    <h1>Adiantopsis dichotoma</h1>
<p>Adiantopsis dichotoma, commonly known as the forked maidenhair fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bioluminescent fronds that often appear to glow in the dim light of its natural habitat. The plant exhibits a unique dichotomous branching pattern, with each frond splitting into two equal parts, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in high humidity and requires indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in the wild.</p>
