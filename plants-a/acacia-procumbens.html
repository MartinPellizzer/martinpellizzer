<p>Acacia procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate wattle, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval leaflets.</p>
<p>Acacia procumbens is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal and sandy soils.</p>
