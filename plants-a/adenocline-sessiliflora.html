                <h1>Adenocline sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Adenocline sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered adenocline, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species with showy flowers and aromatic properties. The plant is characterized by its small, sessile leaves and clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its family.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocline sessiliflora has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is woody, with a rough texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a bushy habit. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocline sessiliflora is primarily native to the western regions of the United States, specifically in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and along the Pacific coastline. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with dunes and maritime habitats. It is adapted to mild, temperate climates with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>Adenocline sessiliflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocline sessiliflora was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida and Georgia. It has been reported in several invasive plant databases due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Its introduction is believed to be from natural dispersal rather than intentional cultivation.</p>
