                    <h1>Aphelandra nervosa</h1>
<p>Aphelandra nervosa, commonly known as the flame tree or sacred flame, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated, bright yellow or orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often hidden beneath the showy bracts. Aphelandra nervosa thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
