                <h1>Acronia jaramilloi</h1>
<p>Acronia jaramilloi, commonly known as the Jaramillo's acronia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia jaramilloi has small, narrow leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a glossy green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and attracting insect pollinators such as bees and flies. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia jaramilloi is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in parts of Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas within the Andes Mountains. This plant thrives in temperate to cool climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with open habitats such as slopes and ridges.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia jaramilloi was mainly introduced to the Gal√°pagos Islands.</p>
<p>It was first discovered in the highland areas of Santa Cruz Island. The plant is believed to have been introduced by human activity, possibly through accidental transport. It has since become established in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native flora remains under study.</p>
