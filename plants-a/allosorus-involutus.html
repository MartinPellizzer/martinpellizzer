<p>Allosorus involutus, commonly known as the curled bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the bladders are its primary vegetative and reproductive organs.</p>
<p>Allosorus involutus is a carnivorous plant that uses its bladders to capture and digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
