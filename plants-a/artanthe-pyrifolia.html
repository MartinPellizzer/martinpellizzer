                    <h1>Artanthe pyrifolia</h1>
<p>Artanthe pyrifolia, commonly known as the fireleaf plant, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features striking, palmately lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a fire, hence its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, adding visual interest in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
