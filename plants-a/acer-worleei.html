<p>Acer worleei, commonly known as the Worlee maple, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a striking reddish or bronze hue during the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acer worleei is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical conservation efforts.</p>
