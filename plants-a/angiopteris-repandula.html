                    <h1>Angiopteris repandula</h1>
<p>Angiopteris repandula, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, and deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
