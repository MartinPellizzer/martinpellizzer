                        <h1>Acalypha erosa</h1>
<p>Acalypha erosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or redroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas.</p>
<p>Acalypha erosa is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through both seeds and vegetative propagation.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha erosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and the Philippines. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to some areas of Australia, particularly in northern Queensland.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha erosa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activity, such as trade or intentional planting, during the 19th or early 20th century. The plant has since become naturalized in several areas, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions have led to its spread beyond cultivated areas.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major invasive species in the region.</p>
