                <h1>Adenogramma mollugo</h1>
<p>Adenogramma mollugo, commonly known as the small adenogramma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Adenogramma mollugo is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its delicate appearance and ease of care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenogramma mollugo has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy green in color and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth, reddish-brown bark and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, bloom during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma mollugo is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>It is a species of flowering plant found in the region's diverse fynbos vegetation. The plant thrives in the unique climate and soil conditions of the Cape Floristic Region. It is commonly found in coastal and mountainous areas within the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>This distribution reflects its adaptation to the specific ecological niche of the area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma mollugo was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape province.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The plant has since spread beyond cultivation and is now found in naturalized populations along roadsides and in urban areas. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
