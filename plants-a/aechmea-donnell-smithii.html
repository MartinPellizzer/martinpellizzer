                <h1>Aechmea donnell-smithii</h1>
<p>Aechmea donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from rainfall. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture and may have a reddish or purple hue along the margins. It produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range from yellow to orange, often with red bracts.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea donnell-smithii has rosette-shaped leaves that are sword-like, arranged in a tight spiral, with a bluish-green color and a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, thick base that resembles a pseudostem, which is typically green and smooth. It produces inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, usually red or orange, arranged in a spadix surrounded by bracts, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by birds. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the air and soil.</p>
