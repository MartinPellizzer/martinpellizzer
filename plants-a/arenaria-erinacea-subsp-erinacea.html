<p>Arenaria erinacea subsp.</p>
<p>erinacea, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in the Mediterranean region. It features a compact rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique texture and drought tolerance.</p>
