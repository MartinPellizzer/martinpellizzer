                    <h1>Arthrochortus</h1>
<p>Arthrochortus, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, often delicate flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. They are native to various regions in Africa, Madagascar, and the Middle East, often growing in rocky or arid environments. Arthrochortus species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or other surfaces rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their unique adaptations to harsh environments and their role in ecological systems.</p>
