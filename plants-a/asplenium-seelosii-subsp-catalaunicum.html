<p>Asplenium seelosii subsp.</p>
<p>catalaunicum, commonly known as the Catalaunian spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the undersides of its leaves, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its horticultural appeal and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded gardens.</p>
