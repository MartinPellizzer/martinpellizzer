<p>Aechmea organensis, commonly known as the Organ Mountains bromeliad, is a species native to the subtropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant features vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, often blooming in the spring. Its foliage is typically broad and sword-like, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Aechmea organensis is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea organensis has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, stiff, and covered in fine hairs, arranged in a compact spiral around the plant's central axis.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically a deep green color with a waxy coating, and they can grow up to 40 cm in length. The plant lacks a true stem, and its base is covered in a dense, fibrous mat of roots that anchor it to the substrate.

<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases small, black seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
