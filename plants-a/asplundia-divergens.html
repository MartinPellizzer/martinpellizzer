<p>Asplundia divergens, commonly known as the mountain arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Asplundia divergens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in local medicine.</p>
