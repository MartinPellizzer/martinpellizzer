                <h1>Acrostichum semipinnatifidum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum semipinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its unique leaf structure and vibrant flowers make it a distinctive species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum semipinnatifidum has large, feather-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a somewhat fibrous texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-winged samara that disperses its seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in wet, swampy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum semipinnatifidum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, swamps, and along the margins of rivers and lakes. This fern thrives in humid environments with rich, moist soil. Its natural range extends from southern Mexico through the Caribbean islands to northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It is also present in some regions of the southern United States, such as Florida and Texas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum semipinnatifidum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its unique feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing near water bodies such as rivers and mangrove areas. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, where it now plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in these regions.</p>
