<p>Aspidium cycadinum, commonly known as the cycad fern, is a unique plant that exhibits characteristics of both ferns and cycads.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspidiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features large, pinnately divided leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Despite its fern-like appearance, it is closely related to cycads, which are more primitive plants.</p>
