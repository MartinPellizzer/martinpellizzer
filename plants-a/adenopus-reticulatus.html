                <h1>Adenopus reticulatus</h1>
<p>Adenopus reticulatus, commonly known as the African nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes other members commonly referred to as nettles. The plant is characterized by its stinging hairs on the leaves and stems, which can cause irritation upon contact. It typically grows as an erect shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters.</p>
<p>Adenopus reticulatus is often found in moist, shaded areas and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopus reticulatus has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to grey in color, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopus reticulatus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary vegetation. It is also present in parts of southern Arabia and the Horn of Africa.</p>
<p>Adenopus reticulatus is an important component of the local flora and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopus reticulatus was mainly introduced to new environments as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant's ability to thrive in diverse soil conditions has contributed to its spread. However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its ecological impact in non-native habitats.</p>
