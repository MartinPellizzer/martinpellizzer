                    <h1>Acacia aneura var. conifera</h1>
<p>Acacia aneura var. conifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, narrow, phyllodes that resemble leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spherical or cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife.</p>
