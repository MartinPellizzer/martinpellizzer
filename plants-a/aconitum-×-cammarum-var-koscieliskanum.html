                <h1>Aconitum × cammarum var. koscieliskanum</h1>
<p>Aconitum × cammarum var. koscieliskanum, commonly known as the Koscieliskanum monkshood, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to violet spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green and hairy. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and toxic properties, it is cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum × cammarum var. koscieliskanum has large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 20 to 30 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered with a rough, ridged texture, exhibiting a grayish-brown color and growing in a straight, upright pattern. The flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, thick, and fibrous, serving as storage organs and contributing to the plant's hardiness.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum × cammarum var. koscieliskanum is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly the Carpathian Basin.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, where it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. It is typically found in woodland edges, meadows, and stream banks, preferring shady to semi-shaded environments. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum × cammarum var. koscieliskanum is a striking perennial plant known for its tall, spiky flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in the spring. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, with the first year focusing on root development and the second year producing flowers and seeds.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, moist soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its vigor. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns enhances its ornamental appeal in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
