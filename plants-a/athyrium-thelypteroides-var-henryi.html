<p>Athyrium thelypteroides var. henryi, commonly known as Henry's lady fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the natural habitat.</p>
