                    <h1>Amphibolis antarctica</h1>
<p>Amphibolis antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in coastal and subantarctic environments, often growing in dense mats on rocky shores. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted to the harsh, wind-swept conditions of its habitat. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for coastal organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
