                <h1>Adelia pinetorum</h1>
<p>Adelia pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest geranium, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically produces vibrant pink or red blooms during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Adelia pinetorum thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia pinetorum has compound, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically measuring 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips, and it grows in a shrub-like pattern with multiple branches. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia pinetorum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal dunes and maritime hammocks. This plant is adapted to humid, subtropical climates and is often associated with wetlands and estuarine environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia pinetorum was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in regions where pine trees are common.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in forested landscapes. The plant is known for its ornamental value, with its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It has been introduced to several countries in Europe and parts of North America.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
