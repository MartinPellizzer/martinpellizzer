<p>Andropogon praematurus f. hirtivaginatus, commonly known as the hairy sheath bluestem, is a variant of the bluestem grass family native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy sheaths on the leaf stems, which distinguish it from other similar species. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes and along stream banks. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wildlife.</p>
