                    <h1>Aconitum lycoctonum var. gmelinii</h1>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum var. gmelinii, commonly known as the Siberian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple hooded flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, preferring cooler climates.</p>
<p>However, it is highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, making it dangerous to handle or ingest.</p>
