                <h1>Achillea puberula</h1>
<p>Achillea puberula, commonly known as silky yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine white hairs. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to white, arranged in flat-topped clusters.</p>
<p>Silky yarrow is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea puberula has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and are generally gray-green in color with a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and upright, with a greenish-gray bark that becomes more woody with age. The flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, and are typically pale yellow to white, blooming from late spring to early summer; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea puberula is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in regions of the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained to slightly wet soils. It is often associated with the understory of mixed hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Its native range extends from New York to Georgia and westward into Kentucky and Tennessee.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea puberula was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species and for ornamental purposes in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open areas where it can thrive with minimal care. This plant has been used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its introduction has also led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, it remains a popular choice for its hardy nature and attractive yellow flowers.</p>
