<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis indecora var. macrophylla is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America, particularly in countries such as Peru and Ecuador.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now also found in cultivation in other parts of the world, including some botanical gardens and private collections. This species thrives in humid, temperate environments, often growing in forest understories or on rocky slopes. It typically occurs at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered a species of concern and may be at risk of becoming endangered in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aciotis indecora var. macrophylla is a striking ornamental plant known for its large, showy leaves and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seed, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant typically follows a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like hibiscus or croton can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a healthy garden ecosystem.</p>
