<p>Aspasia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf aspasia, is a small, perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle touch of color to its alpine habitat.
