                <h1>Actinidia arisanensis</h1>
<p>Actinidia arisanensis, commonly known as the Arisan kiwifruit, is a deciduous vine native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common kiwifruit but are less widely cultivated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often grown for its ornamental value as well as its fruit.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia arisanensis has alternate, simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually 5–10 cm long and 3–6 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows as a climbing vine with tendrils. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and actinomorphic, appearing in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a yellowish-green berry that matures in late summer, dispersing via birds and mammals after the flesh is eaten.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a shallow network, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia arisanensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is found in areas with high humidity and cool climates, typically in dense forests. This species grows at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea level. It is commonly associated with shaded, moist environments along streams and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia arisanensis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in partial shade to full sun conditions and is commonly cultivated for its edible fruits. This plant is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and potential for fruit production. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native habitat, including parts of North America and Europe.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasive spread in non-native environments.</p>
