                    <h1>Atriplex draconis</h1>
<p>Atriplex draconis, commonly known as dragon's tail, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions makes it an important pioneer species in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Atriplex draconis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping.</p>
