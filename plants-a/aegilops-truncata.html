                <h1>Aegilops truncata</h1>
<p>Aegilops truncata, commonly known as the goat grass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often bracted, with small, two-lobed florets that are typically green or pale in color. Aegilops truncata is native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for improving crop resilience and yield.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops truncata has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically flat, linear, and arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hollow, and cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light green color, growing from the base upward. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, blooming in the spring and being pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, with each seed having a small, membranous appendage.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
