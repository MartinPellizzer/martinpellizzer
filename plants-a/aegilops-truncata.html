                    <h1>Aegilops truncata</h1>
<p>Aegilops truncata, commonly known as the goat grass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often bracted, with small, two-lobed florets that are typically green or pale in color. Aegilops truncata is native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for improving crop resilience and yield.</p>
