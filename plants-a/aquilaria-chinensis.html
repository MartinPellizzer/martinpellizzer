                    <h1>Aquilaria chinensis</h1>
<p>Aquilaria chinensis, commonly known as the agarwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic resinous wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The tree produces a unique oil called aloeswood, which forms within the heartwood when infected by specific fungi. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and can grow up to 20 meters tall.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN.</p>
