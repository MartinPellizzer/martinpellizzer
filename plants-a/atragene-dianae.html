<p>Atragene dianae, commonly known as the Dianae's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique, ghost-like appearance that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that mimic the texture of bark.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Atragene dianae is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
