                    <h1>Alectorolophus pacificus</h1>
<p>Alectorolophus pacificus, commonly known as the Pacific lichen, is a unique composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a crust-like growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to surfaces. It plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
