                    <h1>Artemisia arachnoidea</h1>
<p>Artemisia arachnoidea, commonly known as desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia arachnoidea is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in various medicinal and cultural practices.</p>
