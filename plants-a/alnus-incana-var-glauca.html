<p>Alnus incana var. glauca, commonly known as the blueleaf alder, is a variant of the gray alder native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its smooth, bluish-gray bark and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration projects.</p>
