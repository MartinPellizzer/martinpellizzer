                <h1>Acianthera fenestrata</h1>
<p>Acianthera fenestrata, commonly known as the window orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, which features perforations or holes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and delicate, often appearing in clusters, and are usually white or pale pink in color.</p>
<p>Acianthera fenestrata is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera fenestrata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that has a slightly woody texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera fenestrata is primarily native to Brazil South and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans these regions. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soil. The plant is often associated with rocky outcrops and forest understories.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific areas in southeastern Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera fenestrata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, gardens, and abandoned fields. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its ability to spread rapidly has led to its establishment in several non-native locations.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered highly invasive in most areas where it has been introduced.</p>
