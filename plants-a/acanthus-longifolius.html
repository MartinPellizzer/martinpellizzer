                <h1>Acanthus longifolius</h1>
<p>Acanthus longifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acanthus, is a striking plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, spiny leaves that are often used in classical architecture as decorative elements. The plant produces tall spikes of purple or pink flowers in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is often cultivated in gardens and historic sites.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthus longifolius has large, deeply lobed leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a silvery-gray underside and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem, which is woody and has a rough, fissured bark that is typically a deep brown or reddish-brown. Its flowers are spiky and complex, with spiny bracts and small purple to reddish flowers that bloom in summer, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and deep, helping the plant anchor in rocky or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthus longifolius is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of the world, including the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, often as an introduced species. This plant thrives in coastal areas, rocky soils, and sunny environments, typically growing in well-drained, sandy or limestone soils. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from sea level up to about 500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, it is considered a non-native invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native flora.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthus longifolius is a striking perennial plant known for its large, deeply lobed leaves and showy spires of violet-blue flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil, with regular watering during the growing season but allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize it with a balanced fertilizer in early spring, and prune back dead foliage after flowering to encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered, and it pairs well with companion plants like lavender or rosemary for improved growth and pest deterrence.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acanthus longifolius is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, spiny flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its dense foliage. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions in its habitat.</p>
