                <h1>Acrothamnus melaleucoides</h1>
<p>Acrothamnus melaleucoides, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in coastal environments, often found on sandy soils and cliffs. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus melaleucoides has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes flaky with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in spikes, typically pink or red, blooming from late summer to autumn, and they are pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to anchor itself and access water in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus melaleucoides is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland margins. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in areas with a temperate to subtropical climate. The species is well adapted to the environmental conditions of these regions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus melaleucoides was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas, particularly along roadsides and in degraded soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common sight in regions with low rainfall. This plant is often found in coastal areas and near human settlements due to its tolerance of poor soil conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds contribute to its success in these habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
