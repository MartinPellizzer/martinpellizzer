                <h1>Acinodendron resimum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron resimum, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its seeds are encased in a fluffy, cotton-like material, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron resimum has leaves that are simple, elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron resimum is primarily native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is also present in parts of Central and Southern Africa, growing in dense undergrowth and humid lowland forests. It is an important component of the local flora and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become increasingly restricted in recent years.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron resimum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and degraded forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high rainfall and warm temperatures. The plant is often found in low-lying areas and can tolerate a range of soil types. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
