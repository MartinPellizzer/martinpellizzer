                        <h1>Acanthocereus floridanus</h1>
<p>Acanthocereus floridanus, commonly known as the Florida night bloomer cactus, is a species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with ribbed stems and produces white, fragrant flowers at night. The plant has spiny areoles and is adapted to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its unique blooming pattern makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthocereus floridanus is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coasts and in dunes. This plant thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to salt spray and sandy substrates. It is often seen in areas with low humidity and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthocereus floridanus was mainly introduced to the Florida Keys and parts of southern Florida.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in coastal environments. The plant has since spread beyond its original introduction sites, becoming established in disturbed areas and along roadsides. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>However, it also plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
