                <h1>Adenocarpus bacquei</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus bacquei, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs.</p>
<p>Adenocarpus bacquei is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus bacquei has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slightly fibrous texture. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus bacquei is primarily native to Morocco.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. It thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often in coastal and mountainous areas. Adenocarpus bacquei is adapted to the harsh climate conditions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is an important species in the local flora and has ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus bacquei was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity or natural disturbances.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in grasslands, shrublands, and along roadsides in its introduced range. Its ability to grow in nutrient-poor soils gives it a competitive advantage in invaded areas.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
