<p>Arenaria aggregata var. frigida, commonly known as the cold sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its rocky or sandy habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms.</p>
