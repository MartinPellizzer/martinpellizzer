                <h1>Acrodon bellidiflorus</h1>
<p>Acrodon bellidiflorus, commonly known as the Mexican bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and somewhat woody.</p>
<p>Acrodon bellidiflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrodon bellidiflorus has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are tubular, bell-shaped, and bright yellow, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodon bellidiflorus is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the coastal and mountainous regions of the area. It thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open habitats. The species is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region.</p>
<p>It is an important part of the local flora and ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodon bellidiflorus was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species for resources. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists and land managers.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its population to protect local ecosystems.</p>
