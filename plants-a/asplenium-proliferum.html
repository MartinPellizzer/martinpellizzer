<p>Asplenium proliferum, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are lance-shaped and usually have a dark green color with a slightly glossy surface. It produces spores in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the late spring and summer months.</p>
<p>This plant is often found growing on rocks, walls, or in damp soil, making it a common sight in temperate regions.</p>
