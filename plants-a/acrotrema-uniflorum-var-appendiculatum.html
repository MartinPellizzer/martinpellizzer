                    <h1>Acrotrema uniflorum var. appendiculatum</h1>
<p>Acrotrema uniflorum var. appendiculatum, commonly known as the appendiculate acrotrema, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and a single, elongated flower stalk that bears a single umbel of small, white flowers. The plant is adapted to specific ecological niches, often found in rocky or alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is typical for many members of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
