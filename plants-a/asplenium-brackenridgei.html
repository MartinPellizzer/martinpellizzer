                    <h1>Asplenium brackenridgei</h1>
<p>Asplenium brackenridgei, commonly known as the Brackenridge's spleenwort, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered in dense rosettes. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found on rocky substrates or in crevices of mountainous terrain. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
