<p>[WRONG START] Arabis glabra f. columnaris, commonly known as the columnar rockcress, is a compact, low-growing plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It features upright, slender stems that give it its distinctive columnar appearance. The leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and appear in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
