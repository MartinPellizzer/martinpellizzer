                <h1>Acer palmifolium f. integrilobum</h1>
<p>Acer palmifolium f. integrilobum, commonly known as the smooth-leaf maple, is a cultivar of the maple tree characterized by its broad, palmate leaves with smooth, undivided margins.</p>
<p>It is native to the Appalachian region of the United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant exhibits a distinct upright growth habit with a dense, rounded crown. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and gold in the fall, making it a popular ornamental choice.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its relatively slow growth rate.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer palmifolium f. integrilobum has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a broad, spreading shape and a bright green color during the growing season.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternately arranged along the stem, which is slender and relatively smooth with a light gray bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samarum (winged seed) that disperses by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer palmifolium f. integrilobum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations in the Hengduan Mountains. It thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and well-drained soils, typically found in temperate forests. This subspecies grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is listed as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer palmifolium f. integrilobum is a striking ornamental tree known for its palmate leaves and vibrant autumn color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for germination. The growth cycle involves a slow initial development, followed by steady growth during the growing season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering but avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like ferns or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer palmifolium f. integrilobum is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil stability. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer palmifolium f. integrilobum is a lesser-known variant of the maple family with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
<p>It has limited medicinal applications due to its low levels of bioactive compounds, though it may be used in local herbal practices. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and ecological stability, supporting wildlife and soil health in its native habitats. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in regions where it grows, often representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and symbolic than economic or culinary.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer palmifolium f. integrilobum has a range of popular cultivars such as 'Aconitifolium' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their unique foliage patterns and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It also produces hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the diversity of maple trees in horticultural collections. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced cold hardiness and vibrant autumn color, making them popular choices for garden landscapes. The cultivars and hybrids of this species are highly valued for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer palmifolium f. integrilobum plays a significant role in ornamental horticulture due to its visual impact and versatility.</p>
