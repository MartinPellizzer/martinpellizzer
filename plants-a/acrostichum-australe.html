                <h1>Acrostichum australe</h1>
<p>Acrostichum australe, commonly known as the Australian fern, is a tropical plant native to the coastal regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats along the ground.</p>
<p>Acrostichum australe is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in coastal areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum australe has large, feather-like leaves that are broadly triangular in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can reach up to 2 meters in length, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a dense, clump-forming pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom from late winter to early spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum australe is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal and estuarine environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. This plant is well adapted to brackish water conditions and can tolerate periodic flooding. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the temperate regions of the southeastern coast of Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum australe was mainly introduced to coastal and estuarine areas of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, mangrove swamps, and saltmarshes along the eastern coast. This plant thrives in brackish or saline environments and is often associated with tidal zones. It has been reported in several states including New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.</p>
<p>Its introduction has had minimal impact on native ecosystems, though it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
