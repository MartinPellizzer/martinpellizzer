<p>Acacia ureniae, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Acacia ureniae is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a resilient species in harsh, semi-desert environments.</p>
