                        <h1>Absinthium dentatum</h1>
<p>Absinthium dentatum, commonly known as common wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, branched stems that are often hairy, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which bloom in late summer. Its aromatic foliage contains volatile oils, including thujone, which contribute to its distinctive bitter taste.</p>
<p>Absinthium dentatum is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine and as a component in absinthe.</p>
