<p>Ajuga iva, commonly known as carpet bugle or ivy bugle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Valerianaceae family and is characterized by its creeping rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its fragrance is often described as minty or slightly aromatic.</p>
<p>Ajuga iva is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds in shaded areas.</p>
