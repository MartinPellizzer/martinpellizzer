                <h1>Axonopus paniceus</h1>
<p>Axonopus paniceus, commonly known as flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often mistaken for grasses. The plant is typically found in moist, low-lying areas such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Axonopus paniceus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
