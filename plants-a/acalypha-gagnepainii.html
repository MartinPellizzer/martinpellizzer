                        <h1>Acalypha gagnepainii</h1>
<p>Acalypha gagnepainii, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bright yellow bracts that resemble flames. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with smooth, dark green leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by the showy bracts.</p>
<p>Acalypha gagnepainii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha gagnepainii is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern part of the island, specifically in the coastal regions and lowland areas. This plant thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha gagnepainii was mainly introduced to specific regions in Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in local ecosystems. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction make it a potential threat to native flora.</p>
<p>As a result, monitoring and management strategies are being developed to control its spread in these areas.</p>
