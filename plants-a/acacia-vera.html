                        <h1>Acacia vera</h1>
<p>Acacia vera, commonly known as Indian gum or gum arabic, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender, yellowish-green pods that contain a sticky, resinous substance called gum arabic. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feathery leaflets, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or pale green.</p>
<p>The gum arabic extracted from its pods is widely used in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries due to its emulsifying and stabilizing properties.</p>
