                    <h1>Alsophila decomposita</h1>
<p>Alsophila decomposita, commonly known as the decomposed fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, bioluminescent fronds that emit a soft blue glow at night. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique luminescence is due to a symbiotic relationship with bioluminescent algae.</p>
<p>This rare and striking plant is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its ecological significance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
