                <h1>Adiantum capillus-gorgonis</h1>
<p>Adiantum capillus-gorgonis, commonly known as the "hairpin fern," is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, arching fronds that are adorned with small, hair-like structures along the leaf edges, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or wooded areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and intricate leaf morphology.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum capillus-gorgonis has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and are typically arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually light green, with a slender and graceful structure, and can reach lengths of up to 30 cm. The plant lacks true stems and instead has a short, creeping rhizome that supports the rosette of leaves. It does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-bearing plant, and instead reproduces via spores released from the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum capillus-gorgonis is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in humid forests. Its distribution includes parts of the Caribbean as well as the southern United States, including Florida.</p>
<p>It is typically found in lowland areas with rich, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum capillus-gorgonis was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its delicate, fern-like appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens and indoor spaces where it adds a touch of elegance with its finely divided fronds. The plant is also valued for its air-purifying qualities, making it a popular choice for indoor landscaping. Its introduction has led to its presence in various regions beyond its native habitat, sometimes becoming an invasive species in non-native areas.</p>
<p>Careful management is recommended to prevent its spread in ecosystems where it is not native.</p>
