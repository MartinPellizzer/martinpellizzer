<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Adenostyles mairei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles mairei has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows in a shrub-like form with multiple branching.

The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soil conditions and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles mairei is primarily native to the mountainous regions of China, particularly in the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, humid climates at high altitudes, often found in forests or rocky areas. This plant is commonly associated with subtropical and temperate zones, growing in well-drained soils. It is also occasionally found in nearby regions of Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam and Myanmar.</p>
<p>Adenostyles mairei is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles mairei was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest margins. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
