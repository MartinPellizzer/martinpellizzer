                    <h1>Astragalus coltonii var. aphyllus</h1>
<p>Astragalus coltonii var. aphyllus, commonly known as the leafless milkvetch, is a rare and endemic species native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, hairy stem and reduced leaves that are often absent or highly modified. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
