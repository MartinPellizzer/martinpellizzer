                    <h1>Agrostis laxa var. pumila</h1>
<p>Agrostis laxa var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, often in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its flowering spikes are usually short and inconspicuous, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions.</p>
