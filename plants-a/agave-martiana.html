                    <h1>Agave martiana</h1>
<p>Agave martiana, commonly known as the blue agave, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which are pollinated by various insects. Agave martiana is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its rosette growth form and ability to store water in its leaves make it an important species in arid environments.</p>
