                    <h1>Agave maculosa var. minor</h1>
<p>Agave maculosa var. minor, commonly known as the lesser margarita agave, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features narrow, blue-green leaves with white to pale green marginal stripes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental value rather than its blooms. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and ability to form clumps make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
