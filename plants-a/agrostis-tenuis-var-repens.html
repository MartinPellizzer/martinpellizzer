                    <h1>Agrostis tenuis var. repens</h1>
<p>Agrostis tenuis var. repens, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and compact inflorescences. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of grassland vegetation.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is distinguished by its small, spike-like flower clusters and its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions.</p>
