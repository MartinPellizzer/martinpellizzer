                <h1>Aegopodium tenerum</h1>
<p>Aegopodium tenerum, commonly known as slender ground-ivy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, white or greenish flowers are typically arranged in umbels, and it has finely divided, fern-like leaves.</p>
<p>Aegopodium tenerum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegopodium tenerum has leaves that are heart-shaped, with a lobed margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, slightly hairy surface, and it grows upright with a branched structure. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels, and bloom from late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
