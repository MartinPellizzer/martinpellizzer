<p>Asplenium mauritianum, commonly known as the Mauritius spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the island of Mauritius.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
