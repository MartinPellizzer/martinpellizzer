                    <h1>Antrophyum niphoboloides</h1>
<p>Antrophyum niphoboloides, commonly known as the snowball cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spherical inflorescence that resembles a snowball, consisting of numerous small, yellowish female flowers surrounded by a cluster of green, leaf-like structures. The plant has a slow growth rate and is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils. It is dioecious, meaning individual plants are either male or female, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
