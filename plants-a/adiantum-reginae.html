                <h1>Adiantum reginae</h1>
<p>Adiantum reginae, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a pale underside. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum reginae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum reginae has fronds that are pinnately compound, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they are usually arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, with a smooth texture, and they range in size from 15 to 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome that produces new shoots, and the stem is usually covered in a thin, smooth, and light green bark. Adiantum reginae produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures rather than flowers, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing water and nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum reginae is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded woodlands and rocky stream banks. This fern thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its native range includes states such as Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia.</p>
<p>It is often regarded as an indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum reginae was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This fern is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, lace-like fronds and ornamental value. It has been reported to naturalize in some areas, leading to concerns about its invasive potential.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is now considered an introduced species in several regions beyond its native range.</p>
