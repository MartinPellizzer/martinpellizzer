                <h1>Acosta cuneifolia</h1>
<p>Acosta cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta cuneifolia has elongated, narrow leaves that are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green with five petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta cuneifolia is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, typically at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters. This plant thrives in cooler, temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with rocky or mountainous terrain where it forms part of the local vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, Acosta cuneifolia is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta cuneifolia was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This plant is commonly used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. It has also been introduced to regions with similar ecological conditions to expand its range.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific soil and climate preferences.</p>
