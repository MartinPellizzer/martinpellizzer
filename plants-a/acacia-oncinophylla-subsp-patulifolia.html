                        <h1>Acacia oncinophylla subsp. patulifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia oncinophylla subsp.</p>
<p>patulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its yellow floral spikes and broad, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia oncinophylla subsp.</p>
<p>patulifolia belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some green algae, characterized by their ability to perform photosynthesis. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses ferns, horsetails, and their relatives, known for their primitive vascular structures.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is characterized by their diverse floral structures. Its order is Fabales, which includes plants such as legumes and vetches, known for their ability to form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, recognized by their distinctive pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees found mainly in tropical and subtropical regions, known for their phyllodes and often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia oncinophylla, a specific type of acacia with the subspecies patulifolia, which is distinguished by its particular morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia oncinophylla subsp.</p>
<p>patulifolia is primarily native to Western Australia. This subspecies is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the area around the Geraldton region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of the region. The plant is commonly found in open woodlands and shrublands.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia oncinophylla subsp.</p>
<p>patulifolia was mainly introduced to regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal areas and open woodlands.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and parks. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native flora in areas where it has been released.</p>
