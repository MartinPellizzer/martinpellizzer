<p>Ampelopsis brevipedunculata f. ciliata, commonly known as the silky honeysuckle, is a flowering vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with soft, hairy margins. The plant produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers in late summer, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and unique fruiting display.</p>
