                <h1>Adiantum cuneatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that resemble a feather. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost translucent appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum cuneatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum cuneatum has fern-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a delicate, bipinnate structure, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green, glossy, and can grow up to 30 cm in length, with a finely divided appearance. The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a creeping or upright pattern depending on the environment. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a dry, capsule that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cuneatum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. This fern thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its distribution includes countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and Peru.</p>
<p>Adiantum cuneatum is well adapted to low-light conditions and requires consistent moisture to flourish.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cuneatum was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. This fern is often cultivated in gardens due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions. It has been reported in several states including Pennsylvania, New York, and Maryland.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
