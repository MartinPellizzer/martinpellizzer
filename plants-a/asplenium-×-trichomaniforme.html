                    <h1>Asplenium × trichomaniforme</h1>
<p>Asplenium × trichomaniforme, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a rare and hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium trichomanoides*.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>The botanical interest in this species lies in its unique morphology and its role in the study of fern hybridization.</p>
