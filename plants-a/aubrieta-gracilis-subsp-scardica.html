<p>Aubrieta gracilis subsp.</p>
<p>scardica, commonly known as the slender aubrieta, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May.</p>
<p>The plant has compact, silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
