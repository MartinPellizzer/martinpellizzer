                    <h1>Argentina subarctica</h1>
<p>Argentina subarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic pearlwort, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to the high Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, succulent leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme cold and strong winds. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic invertebrates.</p>
