<p>Asplenium × lessinense, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Asplenium × lessinense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
