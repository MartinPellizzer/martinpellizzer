                <h1>Adenoderris glandulosa</h1>
<p>Adenoderris glandulosa, commonly known as the hairy senna, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has small, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Adenoderris glandulosa is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoderris glandulosa has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, and they are typically 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows as a shrub with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale pink, clustered in inflorescences, and they bloom during the dry season, likely pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, woody pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoderris glandulosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in the understory where it receives partial to full shade. This species thrives in humid tropical climates and is typically associated with secondary forests and disturbed sites. It is also known to occur in parts of northern Australia, where it has been introduced.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoderris glandulosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in several regions of the country. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest margins and along stream banks. Despite its ornamental value, it has raised concerns due to its potential to spread into native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution remains limited but continues to be monitored to prevent ecological impacts.</p>
