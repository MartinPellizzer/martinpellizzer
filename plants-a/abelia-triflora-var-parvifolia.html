<p>Abelia triflora var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved abelia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems with ovate, glossy, dark green leaves that are smaller than those of the typical abelia. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular white flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability in garden settings.</p>
