                <h1>Adenopetalum irasuense</h1>
<p>Adenopetalum irasuense, commonly known as the Irasu bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy areas and has a compact, herbaceous habit. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched.</p>
<p>Adenopetalum irasuense is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum irasuense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. Its flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in dry, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum irasuense is primarily native to the western part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is found in the lowland rainforests of the Congo Basin. The plant grows in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. It is commonly found in the vicinity of the Ituri and Bas-Congo provinces.</p>
<p>Its distribution is restricted to a small geographic area within central Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum irasuense was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forest edges, stream banks, and disturbed sites. The plant thrives in temperate climates and has shown adaptability to various soil types. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Thailand and Malaysia.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact and spread remain under study due to limited long-term data.</p>
