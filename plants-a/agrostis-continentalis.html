<p>Agrostis continentalis, commonly known as continental bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along riverbanks. Its ability to form extensive root systems makes it resilient to environmental stress.</p>
<p>Agrostis continentalis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and turfgrass management.</p>
