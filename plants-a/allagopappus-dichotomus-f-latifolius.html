The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
