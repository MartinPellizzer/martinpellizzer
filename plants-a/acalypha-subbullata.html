                        <h1>Acalypha subbullata</h1>
<p>Acalypha subbullata, commonly known as the woolly croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, silver-green leaves that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Acalypha subbullata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and ability to add visual interest to gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha subbullata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats like forest edges and riverbanks. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and some islands in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can be found in both wild and cultivated environments across its native range.</p>
