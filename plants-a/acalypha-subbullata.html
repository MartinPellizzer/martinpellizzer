<p>Acalypha subbullata, commonly known as the woolly copperleaf, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its densely hairy, silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental for its striking foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha subbullata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged oppositely along the stem, with a smooth surface and a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to pale brown bark that becomes rough with age. It produces small, clustered flowers with five pinkish-white petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-chambered capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to its native habitat in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha subbullata is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>While it was once confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including tropical and subtropical regions. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. It typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Acalypha subbullata is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, although its wild populations remain relatively limited.</p>
