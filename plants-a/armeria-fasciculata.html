                    <h1>Armeria fasciculata</h1>
<p>Armeria fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Armeria fasciculata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
