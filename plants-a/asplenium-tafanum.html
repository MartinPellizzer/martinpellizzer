<p>Asplenium tafanum, commonly known as the Tafanum spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in shaded, humid environments, such as on the trunks of trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium tafanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
