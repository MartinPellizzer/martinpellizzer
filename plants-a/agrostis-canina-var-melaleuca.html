                    <h1>Agrostis canina var. melaleuca</h1>
<p>Agrostis canina var. melaleuca, commonly known as coastal hairgrass, is a variant of the coastal grass species native to the sandy shorelines of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which helps it withstand coastal wind and salt spray. The plant typically grows in low, compact clumps and is often found in dunes and beach habitats. Its flowering stems bear small, spikelet-like inflorescences, which are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
