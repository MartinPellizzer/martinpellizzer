<p>Athyrium scandicinum f. bipinnata, commonly known as the bipinnate lady fern, is a fern species characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate fronds.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates.</p>
