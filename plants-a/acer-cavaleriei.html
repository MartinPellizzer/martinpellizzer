                <h1>Acer cavaleriei</h1>
<p>Acer cavaleriei, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow furrows that become more pronounced as the tree matures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer cavaleriei has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5–10 cm in length; they are dark green in summer and turn bright red in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and upright, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during spring, which are wind-pollinated; the flowers have five petals and are inconspicuous. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the tree and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cavaleriei is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, specifically in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Hengduan Mountains. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in forests at high altitudes. The plant is usually found between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural reproduction, Acer cavaleriei is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer cavaleriei is a striking maple tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer cavaleriei includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or roses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer cavaleriei is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and promoting the growth of other plant species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and reducing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer cavaleriei contributes to carbon sequestration, playing a vital role in maintaining ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer cavaleriei is a species of maple tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it suitable for furniture and carving. In traditional Chinese medicine, parts of the tree have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and respiratory issues. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in local landscapes and art.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting biodiversity and soil conservation also highlights its ecological significance in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer cavaleriei has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Autumnalis' and 'Red Prince,' which showcase vibrant fall colors and unique leaf patterns.</p>
<p>It has also been hybridized with other maple species, leading to the development of cultivars like 'Crimson Queen' and 'Emerald Queen,' which exhibit enhanced growth habits and coloration. These hybrids and cultivars are highly valued in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden settings. The plant's ornamental qualities make it a favorite among landscape designers and gardeners.</p>
<p>Its cultivation contributes significantly to the diversity of maple trees in both public and private gardens.</p>
