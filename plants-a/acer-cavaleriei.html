                <h1>Acer cavaleriei</h1>
<p>Acer cavaleriei, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red or orange samaras. It typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer cavaleriei has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, arranged in inflorescences, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its native mountainous habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cavaleriei is a rare and endangered maple species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in southwestern China.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat consists of humid, temperate forests at high altitudes, typically between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is highly restricted, with only a few known populations remaining in the wild. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in mixed evergreen and deciduous forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural reproduction, Acer cavaleriei is listed as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to prevent its extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer cavaleriei is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant fall colors and elegant form, commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer cavaleriei includes a dormant phase in winter, active growth in spring, and a period of leaf color change in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove diseased branches promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with flowering shrubs and perennials for aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer cavaleriei is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring blossoms and abundant nectar. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of flora and fauna. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and protecting waterways.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through its photosynthetic processes.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer cavaleriei is a species of maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have minor traditional uses in some cultures. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Industrially, its wood is valued for its strength and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and carving.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in landscaping and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer cavaleriei has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Atrosanguineum' and 'Tardiflorum', which are known for their striking red leaves and late flowering.</p>
<p>It also has hybrids with other maple species, such as Acer truncatum, resulting in varieties that exhibit enhanced cold hardiness and unique foliage colors. These cultivars and hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their ability to thrive in temperate climates and their aesthetic appeal. They are commonly used in gardens and landscapes to add visual interest and seasonal color.</p>
<p>Due to their beauty and adaptability, Acer cavaleriei and its derivatives play an important role in ornamental horticulture.</p>
