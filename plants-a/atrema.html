                    <h1>Atrema</h1>
<p>Atrema, commonly known as the "sea holly," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their striking, spiky flower heads and are often found in coastal or saline environments. Atrema species typically have silver or blue-gray foliage, which helps them retain moisture in arid conditions. They produce small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, with Atrema lanata and Atrema lanatifolia being among the most well-known.</p>
