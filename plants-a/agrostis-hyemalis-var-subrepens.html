                    <h1>Agrostis hyemalis var. subrepens</h1>
<p>Agrostis hyemalis var. subrepens, commonly known as winter bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like turf with slender, dark green blades that are often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in lawns and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ability to thrive in cool, wet conditions, contributing to its ecological and horticultural significance.</p>
