                <h1>Actinodaphne venosa</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne venosa, commonly known as the veined laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in catkin-like inflorescences, followed by small, oval berries. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, often used in traditional craftsmanship.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne venosa has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. It produces small, fragrant flowers with four to six petals, typically white or pale yellow, that bloom during the rainy season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed berry that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne venosa is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of the Indonesian archipelago. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, typically in lowland and hill forest areas. It is commonly encountered in the western and eastern regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the unique biodiversity of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne venosa was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in shaded gardens and greenhouses. The plant is often grown as a decorative shrub due to its fragrant leaves and attractive foliage. Its introduction has been primarily driven by horticultural interests rather than agricultural or industrial applications.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
