<p>Achillea × aspleniifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaf yarrow, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely cut, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × aspleniifolia has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a slightly serrated edge and a coarse texture.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, slender, and have a greyish-brown bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and pappus structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × aspleniifolia is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America and Australia, where it is cultivated for its ornamental value. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>While it is not currently listed as endangered, its hybrid nature and limited natural range make it a subject of interest for conservationists.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × aspleniifolia is a low-maintenance perennial known for its fern-like foliage and dainty yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that begins with new growth in spring, flowering in midsummer, and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune dead foliage after flowering to encourage new growth.
