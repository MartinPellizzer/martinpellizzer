                <h1>Adenorima punicea</h1>
<p>Adenorima punicea, commonly known as the red-flowered rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops and coastal cliffs. The plant produces small, pinkish-red flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and have a distinctive reddish or bronze hue, especially when young.</p>
<p>Adenorima punicea is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils, making it a hardy and resilient species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenorima punicea has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or sandy soils where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenorima punicea is primarily native to the eastern and southeastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and parts of Alabama.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, particularly in sandy or disturbed soils along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments and is often associated with dunes, roadsides, and other disturbed habitats. It is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>Adenorima punicea is also found in some Caribbean islands, extending its native range into the Caribbean region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenorima punicea was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically Chile. The introduction of Adenorima punicea to New Zealand is believed to have occurred through human activity, possibly as an ornamental plant. It has since become established in certain regions of the country.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact and spread are still being studied by conservationists.</p>
