                    <h1>Aonikena patagonica</h1>
<p>Aonikena patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in the cold, arid environments of South America.</p>
<p>It is a composite organism consisting of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This lichen is often found on rocky surfaces and tree bark in high-altitude regions. Its slow growth and ability to survive extreme conditions make it a resilient indicator of environmental health.</p>
<p>The plant's unique structure and ecological role contribute to its significance in alpine ecosystems.</p>
