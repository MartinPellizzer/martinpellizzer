<p>Astrophytum myriostigma var. potosinum, commonly known as the Potos√≠ Hedgehog Cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly areoles that give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically borne at the base of the stem. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
