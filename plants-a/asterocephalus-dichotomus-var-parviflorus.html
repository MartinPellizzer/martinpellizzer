                    <h1>Asterocephalus dichotomus var. parviflorus</h1>
<p>Asterocephalus dichotomus var. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flower dichotomous aster, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a dichotomous pattern, meaning they split into two equal branches at each node. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
