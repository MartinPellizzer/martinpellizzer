<p>Abuta spicata, commonly known as the red sandalwood or African sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and aromatic bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling spikes, hence its species name *spicata*. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly lobed or toothed margin.</p>
<p>The bark and wood of Abuta spicata have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abuta spicata has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth surface and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and has a reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white or pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abuta spicata is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Colombia and northern Bolivia as well. It thrives in humid, tropical highland environments, often growing in shaded forest undergrowth. Abuta spicata is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable, and its conservation status is a growing concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
