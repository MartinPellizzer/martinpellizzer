                <h1>Adinandra caudatifolia</h1>
<p>Adinandra caudatifolia, commonly known as the long-tailed ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive, elongated inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra caudatifolia has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are white or pale yellow, with five petals and a tubular structure, blooming in spring and attracting insects for pollination. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra caudatifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, typically in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary forests and can be found in both natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Adinandra caudatifolia is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra caudatifolia was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential ecological benefits.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils, such as parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats have contributed to its spread beyond its native range. It is often used in horticulture and reforestation projects due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become an invasive species in some ecosystems.</p>
