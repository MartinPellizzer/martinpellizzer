<p>Atriplex peruviana, commonly known as Peruvian saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent leaves, which are adapted to store water and reduce transpiration in dry environments. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for reclaiming degraded lands. Its small, greenish flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
