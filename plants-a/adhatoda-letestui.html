                <h1>Adhatoda letestui</h1>
<p>Adhatoda letestui, commonly known as the African elaeocarpus, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, black berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a distinctive floral structure.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda letestui has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green upper surface contrasting with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem and are typically 5â€“10 cm in length. The stem is slender, erect, and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda letestui is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with forested or semi-wild environments. It is also present in parts of Africa, particularly in regions with similar climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can be found in both natural and cultivated settings in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda letestui was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, open habitats such as riverbanks and disturbed sites. The plant is often mistaken for Adhatoda vasica due to its similar appearance. It has been reported in several provinces including KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to other species in the genus.</p>
