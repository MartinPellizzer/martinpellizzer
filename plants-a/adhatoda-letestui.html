                <h1>Adhatoda letestui</h1>
<p>Adhatoda letestui, commonly known as the African heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale purple, often with a reddish calyx. It is often found in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda letestui has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth upper surface and a slightly hairy lower surface, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length and 2 to 4 cm in width, and displaying a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that exudes a faint aromatic scent, and it grows in a climbing or semi-erect pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with a tubular corolla that transitions into a lobed structure, colored violet to blue, blooming during the rainy season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, ellipsoid seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda letestui is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Sudan.</p>
<p>Although its native range is limited, it has been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia and the Caribbean in recent decades. It thrives in humid, warm environments, often growing in moist forests or along riverbanks. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, Adhatoda letestui is currently listed as a species of concern in some regions, though its global conservation status remains relatively stable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda letestui is a hardy, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions, known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within 2-3 years under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil with moderate to high moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and promote bushiness are recommended. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while root rot can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adhatoda letestui is a plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in agricultural settings, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops through improved soil conditions. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Adhatoda letestui also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and maintaining the health of local ecosystems.</p>
