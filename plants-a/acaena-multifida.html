                        <h1>Acaena multifida</h1>
<p>Acaena multifida, commonly known as the New Zealand spinach or mountain spinach, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that enclose its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Acaena multifida thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems in New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena multifida is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate climates, often in grasslands and shrublands. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is known for its distinctive, feathery leaves.</p>
<p>Acaena multifida plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting local wildlife and contributing to soil stability.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena multifida was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as an ornamental plant. The species has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in several regions of the country. It thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns due to its competitive nature and impact on local biodiversity.</p>
