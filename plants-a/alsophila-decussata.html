<p>Alsophila decussata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that are often used in horticulture. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Alsophila decussata plays an important role in tropical ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability.</p>
