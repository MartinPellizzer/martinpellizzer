                    <h1>Astragalus tetrapterus var. cinerascens</h1>
<p>Astragalus tetrapterus var. cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-gray milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with four to six pairs of leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its pale, ash-colored stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
