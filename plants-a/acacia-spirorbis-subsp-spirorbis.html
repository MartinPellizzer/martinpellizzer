                        <h1>Acacia spirorbis subsp. spirorbis</h1>
<p>Acacia spirorbis subsp.</p>
<p>spirorbis, commonly known as the spiral wattle, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellow flowers that appear in clusters.</p>
<p>The leaves are phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves, a common adaptation in acacia species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is noted for its distinctive spiral arrangement of branches, which gives it its common name.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia spirorbis subsp.</p>
<p>spirorbis is primarily native to New Caledonia and Vanuatu. This subspecies is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these island nations.</p>
<p>It typically grows in coastal and lowland areas with well-drained soils. The plant is adapted to the humid and warm climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in the local flora of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia spirorbis subsp.</p>
<p>spirorbis was mainly introduced to the Leeward Islands. It is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The introduction likely occurred through human activity, such as horticultural trade or accidental transport. It has since become established in certain areas of the Leeward Islands.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact and distribution are still being studied.</p>
