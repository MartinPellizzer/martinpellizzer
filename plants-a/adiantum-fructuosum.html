<p>Adiantum fructuosum, commonly known as the fruit-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds that are pinnately divided and often have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, dark red to black, fleshy spore capsules that are clustered at the tips of the fronds, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Adiantum fructuosum is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and ease of care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum fructuosum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, with a glossy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a creeping or upright pattern depending on the environment.

<p>This fern is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant is well adapted to the humid climates of the Neotropics.</p>
<p>Its native distribution spans much of Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum fructuosum was mainly introduced to Malaya.</p>
<p>It is a fern species that has been reported in various parts of the region. The introduction of this plant may have occurred through human activities such as horticultural trade or accidental transport. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
