                <h1>Acrotrema intermedium</h1>
<p>Acrotrema intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate acrotrema, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flattened, ribbon-like body that is covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllids. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Acrotrema intermedium is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of microhabitats in humid ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotrema intermedium has small, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly rough texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a prostrate or creeping manner. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers with no distinct petals, blooming in early spring, and is likely wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses its seeds by wind once it opens.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema intermedium is primarily native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is found in the diverse tropical ecosystems of the country, including moist forests and rocky habitats. This plant is commonly observed in the wet zone regions of Sri Lanka. It thrives in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of the rich biodiversity found in Sri Lanka's natural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema intermedium was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and urban areas. This species has a broad ecological tolerance, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types and climatic conditions. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including transportation and land development.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential, it is often overlooked due to its small size and limited economic impact.</p>
