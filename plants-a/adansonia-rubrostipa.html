                <h1>Adansonia rubrostipa</h1>
<p>Adansonia rubrostipa, commonly known as the red-stemmed baobab, is a striking tree native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Adansonia, which includes all the baobab species. The plant is characterized by its thick, swollen trunk that stores water, a feature adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and it produces large, showy white flowers.</p>
<p>The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adansonia rubrostipa has large, thick, leathery leaves that are ovate in shape, dark green in color, and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically gray to brown in color. Its flowers are large, showy, and clustered in panicles, with white petals and a yellow center, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by bats. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the tree to store water and nutrients in its arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia rubrostipa is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern and southern regions of the island, particularly in the rainforests and humid areas. This species thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is commonly found in lowland and montane forest habitats. It is one of the most widely distributed baobab species in Madagascar.</p>
<p>Adansonia rubrostipa plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia rubrostipa was mainly introduced to regions with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, particularly in parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments where it can receive adequate sunlight and minimal rainfall. This species is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience. Its introduction has helped in landscaping and reforestation efforts in areas where drought-tolerant plants are needed.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent invasive spread in non-native habitats.</p>
