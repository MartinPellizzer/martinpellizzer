                <h1>Adiantum repens</h1>
<p>Adiantum repens, commonly known as the running fern, is a delicate, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and often have a waxy appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing along stream banks or in woodland areas. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats that help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Adiantum repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum repens has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they are typically arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are small, usually less than 10 cm in length, with a bright green color that turns bronze in the autumn. The stem is slender, herbaceous, and grows prostrate along the ground, with a smooth, light green bark. Adiantum repens does not produce flowers; instead, it reproduces via spores released from small, inconspicuous structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum repens is primarily native to the eastern United States, including states such as Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of the Appalachian Mountains and extends into the southeastern regions of Canada, including Ontario and Quebec. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along streams, in forests, and in wetlands. It is commonly found in rocky or sandy soils where it can form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its preference for humid, temperate climates with high levels of moisture.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum repens was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly during the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It was brought as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, delicate fronds and ease of cultivation. The plant has since spread beyond cultivation and is now found in moist, shaded areas across various regions of the continent. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most areas and remains primarily a garden species.</p>
