<p>Acrostichum hoffmannii, commonly known as the Hoffmann's brake, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, serrated margin that distinguishes it from other fern species.</p>
