<p>Asplenium fissidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated margin. This plant is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. Asplenium fissidens has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
