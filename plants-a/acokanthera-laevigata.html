                <h1>Acokanthera laevigata</h1>
<p>Acokanthera laevigata, commonly known as the African arrow poison, is a toxic shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces a milky latex that contains potent cardiac glycosides, making it highly poisonous. Its roots and leaves have been traditionally used in poison arrow tips by indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often found growing in shaded, humid environments along riverbanks and in dense forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acokanthera laevigata has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown or greyish-brown, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white or pale green petals, and they bloom during the dry season, likely relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera laevigata is primarily native to Malawi and Tanzania.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the eastern and central regions of these countries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open woodlands and savannas. The species is well adapted to the local environmental conditions of these regions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera laevigata was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in parts of Africa, including countries like South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania. The plant thrives in dry to semi-arid environments and is often associated with rocky or sandy soils. It is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value or traditional medicinal uses.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
