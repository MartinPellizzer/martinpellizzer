<p>Acokanthera laevigata, commonly known as the African arrow poison, is a toxic shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces a milky latex that contains potent cardiac glycosides, making it highly poisonous. Its roots and leaves have been traditionally used in poison arrow tips by indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often found growing in shaded, humid environments along riverbanks and in dense forests.</p>
