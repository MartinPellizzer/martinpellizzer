                    <h1>Asplenium aquaticum</h1>
<p>Asplenium aquaticum, commonly known as the water spleenwort, is a small, aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving water or damp soil near streams and ponds. The plant has delicate, finely divided leaves that are usually submerged or floating, aiding in photosynthesis. Its rhizomes help anchor it to substrates and absorb nutrients from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>Asplenium aquaticum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
