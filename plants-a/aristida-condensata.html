                    <h1>Aristida condensata</h1>
<p>Aristida condensata, commonly known as the densehead wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, sandy soils, and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are tightly clustered. Its seeds are adapted for wind dispersal, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
