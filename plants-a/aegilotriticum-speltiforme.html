                <h1>Aegilotriticum speltiforme</h1>
<p>Aegilotriticum speltiforme, commonly known as false spelt, is a grass species native to central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, parallel-veined leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its historical use in agriculture, it has been studied for its potential as a resilient cereal grain.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilotriticum speltiforme has leaves that are narrow and linear, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a rough, fibrous bark that is light brown in color, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green in color, with a simple structure consisting of six petals, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out just beneath the soil surface, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients.</p>
