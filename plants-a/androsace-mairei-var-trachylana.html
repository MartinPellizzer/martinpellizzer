                    <h1>Androsace mairei var. trachylana</h1>
<p>Androsace mairei var. trachylana, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, rosette-like leaves that are hairy and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals and a spurred structure, adapting to pollination by insects.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest margins.</p>
