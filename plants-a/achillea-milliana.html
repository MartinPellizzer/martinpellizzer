                <h1>Achillea milliana</h1>
<p>Achillea milliana, commonly known as white yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, flat-topped clusters of small white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are aromatic and often used in herbal remedies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Achillea milliana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea milliana has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing in a clumping pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea milliana is primarily native to Turkey.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the central and southern regions of the country. This plant typically grows in rocky and dry habitats. It is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of Turkey.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within the country's natural landscape.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea milliana was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in regions with dry, sunny climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun. This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several states, including California and Nevada.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
