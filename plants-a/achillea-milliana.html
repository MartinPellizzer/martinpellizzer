                <h1>Achillea milliana</h1>
<p>Achillea milliana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and arranged in flat-topped clusters.</p>
<p>Achillea milliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea milliana has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern and measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with fine hairs, turning reddish-brown with age, and grows from the base of the plant. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding orange disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal, and the seeds are lightweight and easily carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea milliana is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Morocco, where it thrives in dry, rocky environments. It typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils, often in grasslands or along coastal areas. This species is usually found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Achillea milliana is listed as vulnerable in some areas, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea milliana is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant yellow flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, blooming within a few months after planting and maintaining a compact form throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea milliana is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts beneficial insects and birds, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other wildflowers to enhance soil health and promote a diverse plant community. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea milliana offers shelter and foraging opportunities for small wildlife, making it an important component of ecological landscapes.</p>
