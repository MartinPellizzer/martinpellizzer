                    <h1>Agropyron fragile var. angustifolium</h1>
<p>Agropyron fragile var. angustifolium, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands.</p>
<p>Its low-growing form and drought tolerance make it an important component of native plant communities in its range.</p>
