                <h1>Aegilops ovata</h1>
<p>Aegilops ovata, commonly known as the slender wild emmer, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brownish spikelets. Aegilops ovata is closely related to wheat and has been studied for its potential in crop improvement due to its genetic diversity.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops ovata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, with a moderate size, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in loose spikes, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, ellipsoid seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
