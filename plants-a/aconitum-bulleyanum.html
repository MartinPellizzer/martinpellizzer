                <h1>Aconitum bulleyanum</h1>
<p>Aconitum bulleyanum, commonly known as the Chinese aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, terminal clusters. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, somewhat fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum bulleyanum contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum bulleyanum has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and somewhat woody at the base, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spike-like inflorescences, with showy spurred petals and a short blooming period in late summer. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, tuberous, and fibrous, serving as storage organs and aiding in the plant's survival in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum bulleyanum is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of central China, including provinces such as Sichuan, Hubei, and Hunan. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is commonly found in forested areas and along stream banks. The species is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking purple or blue flowers.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum bulleyanum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in during the early 20th century as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and upright growth habit. The plant has since established itself in moist, shaded areas along riverbanks and forest edges. However, it has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, its invasive tendencies have led to increased management efforts in some areas.</p>
