                    <h1>Arenaria serpyllifolia var. leptoclados</h1>
<p>Arenaria serpyllifolia var. leptoclados, commonly known as slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its slender stems and reduced leaf size compared to other Arenaria species.</p>
