<p>Asyneuma eldivenum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, violet flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
