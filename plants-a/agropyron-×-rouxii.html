                    <h1>Agropyron × rouxii</h1>
<p>Agropyron × rouxii, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species resulting from the cross between Agropyron cristatum and Agropyron elongatum.</p>
<p>It is native to the northern Great Plains of North America and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and coarse, blue-green foliage. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in ecological restoration and forage production.</p>
<p>Its genetic diversity makes it a valuable resource for breeding programs aimed at improving wheatgrass for agricultural and environmental applications.</p>
