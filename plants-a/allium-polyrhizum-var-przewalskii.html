<p>Allium polyrhizum var. przewalskii, commonly known as the Przewalski's leek, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system and narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clumps. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
