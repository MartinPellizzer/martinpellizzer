<p>Anoectochilus yungianus, commonly known as the Yungiang orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan, China.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a short rhizome and a single, fleshy leaf. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is highly sought after in the horticultural trade, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
