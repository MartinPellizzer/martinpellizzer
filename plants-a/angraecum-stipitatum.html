                    <h1>Angraecum stipitatum</h1>
<p>Angraecum stipitatum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue with a yellow throat. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Angraecum stipitatum blooms during the dry season, usually between June and September, and requires specific conditions to flower successfully.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance is further highlighted by its association with the famous Darwin's moth, which was predicted to pollinate it based on its floral structure.</p>
