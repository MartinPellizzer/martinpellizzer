                    <h1>Aristida nealleyi</h1>
<p>Aristida nealleyi, commonly known as Nealley's threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous bract-like florets. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience.</p>
