                <h1>Achillea subalpina</h1>
<p>Achillea subalpina, commonly known as alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its slender stems and feathery leaves are adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Achillea subalpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea subalpina has narrow, linear to lanceolate leaves that are basal and arranged in a rosette, with a gray-green color and a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing from the base and branching towards the top. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and colonize new areas.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea subalpina is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly found in the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Central and Eastern Europe, though its range has become fragmented due to habitat loss. It thrives in dry, open environments such as rocky slopes and grasslands, often in sunny, well-drained soils. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters, where it faces harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from human activity, Achillea subalpina is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea subalpina is a hardy perennial plant native to alpine regions, known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, flat flower heads.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the rootstock in early spring or fall. The plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in mild climates and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning dead flowers and foliage after blooming helps maintain its appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, thyme, or echinacea can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea subalpina is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering food and shelter. The plant acts as a companion plant in alpine ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion in rocky and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological balance by supporting a wide range of organisms within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea subalpina is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, known for its medicinal properties and traditional uses.</p>
<p>It has been used in folk medicine to treat ailments such as respiratory issues and skin conditions due to its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic compounds. While not widely cultivated for culinary purposes, its flowers may be used in small quantities in herbal teas or infusions. Industrially, it contributes to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems, supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, often associated with resilience and the beauty of high-altitude landscapes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea subalpina has several popular cultivars such as 'Aurea' and 'Purpurea', which are favored for their vibrant foliage and flowering displays.</p>
<p>While it is primarily a species plant, it has been used in hybridization with other Achillea species to create more robust and floriferous varieties. These hybrids often exhibit improved hardiness and extended blooming periods, making them more suitable for garden use. The horticultural importance of Achillea subalpina lies in its ornamental value, particularly in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and aesthetic appeal contribute to its popularity among gardeners and landscapers.</p>
