                <h1>Achillea subalpina</h1>
<p>Achillea subalpina, commonly known as alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features upright, branched stems covered with finely divided, gray-green leaves. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Achillea subalpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea subalpina has leaves that are basal, lanceolate in shape, and have a silver-gray upper surface with a fuzzy texture, while the underside is gray-green and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly woody at the base, with a reddish-brown color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are white to pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, and bloom from June to August, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in rocky or alpine environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea subalpina is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly the Pyrenees, Alps, and Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. This plant is commonly associated with alpine and subalpine ecosystems, where it grows in open, sunny habitats. It is well adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic areas, making it a regionally significant species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea subalpina was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. It is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed.</p>
