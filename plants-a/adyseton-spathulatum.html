                <h1>Adyseton spathulatum</h1>
<p>Adyseton spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed adyseton, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of broad, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adyseton spathulatum has leaves that are spatulate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a broad, flat base and a tapering tip, typically measuring around 5–10 cm in length and 2–4 cm in width.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a deep green color, smooth on the upper surface, and slightly hairy on the underside. The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough as the plant matures, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
