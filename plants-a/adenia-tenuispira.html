                <h1>Adenia tenuispira</h1>
<p>Adenia tenuispira, commonly known as the spiral adenia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves along its stems. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its woody structure and climbing habit make it a distinctive member of the genus Adenia.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia tenuispira has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and covered with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, vertical strips. Its flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, with five pink to reddish petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia tenuispira is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in subtropical and tropical rainforests, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is often associated with rocky outcrops and gullies, growing as an understory species. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within these states, where the climate and soil conditions are suitable.</p>
<p>Adenia tenuispira is a rare and endangered plant, making its native range both geographically and ecologically significant.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia tenuispira was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high sunlight exposure and moderate to high levels of rainfall. The plant is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flower structure.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
