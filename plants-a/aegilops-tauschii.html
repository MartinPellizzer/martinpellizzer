                    <h1>Aegilops tauschii</h1>
<p>Aegilops tauschii, commonly known as the goatgrass, is a wild relative of wheat that plays a significant role in wheat genetics.</p>
<p>It is a diploid species with a genome size that is half that of common wheat, making it a valuable resource for genetic research. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and has a robust root system that helps it thrive in various soil conditions. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets, and its seeds are enclosed in small, tough glumes.</p>
<p>Aegilops tauschii is often used in breeding programs to introduce desirable traits such as disease resistance and improved yield into cultivated wheat varieties.</p>
