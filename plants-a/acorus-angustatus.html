                <h1>Acorus angustatus</h1>
<p>Acorus angustatus, commonly known as narrowleaf sweetflag, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in water-saturated soils. The plant has long, strap-like leaves that are typically narrow and grass-like in appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix enclosed by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>Acorus angustatus is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus angustatus has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, typically ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, with a bright green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and rhizomatous, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows horizontally underground. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in a spadix surrounded by a leaf-like spathe, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a red, berry-like structure that contains multiple seeds, which are dispersed by water and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus angustatus is a wetland plant native to East Asia, including regions such as China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of the world, including North America and Europe, often as an introduced species. This plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments like marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its conservation status can vary depending on local habitat conditions and human impact.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acorus angustatus is a hardy, aromatic aquatic plant commonly found in wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through rhizome division or by planting seeds, though the former is more reliable and faster. The plant grows rapidly in the spring, forming dense foliage that thrives throughout the summer and into the fall.</p>
<p>It prefers moist, sandy or loamy soil and requires regular watering to maintain its lush appearance. Fertilization with a balanced aquatic plant fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while occasional pruning helps maintain shape and prevent overcrowding.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in stagnant water, making companion planting with water lilies or cattails beneficial for ecosystem balance.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acorus angustatus is a wetland plant that provides food and shelter for various aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as insects and birds due to its fragrant flowers and nutrient-rich rhizomes. The plant acts as a natural filter, improving water quality by absorbing pollutants. It also serves as a companion plant in wetland restoration projects, enhancing biodiversity.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acorus angustatus helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along water bodies.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acorus angustatus is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications across various fields.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, it is sometimes used as a flavoring agent in certain traditional dishes, particularly in Southeast Asian cuisines. Medicinally, it has been utilized in traditional systems like Ayurveda and Chinese medicine for its purported digestive and respiratory benefits. Industrially, its rhizomes are valued for their ability to absorb toxins, making them useful in water purification systems.</p>
<p>Culturally, the plant holds symbolic significance in some regions, often associated with purification and spiritual cleansing.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acorus angustatus has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value and adaptability, such as 'Aureus' and 'Variegatus', which exhibit striking color variations.</p>
<p>It is also known for its natural hybrids with other Acorus species, which often display unique foliage patterns and enhanced hardiness. These cultivars and hybrids are favored in wetland gardens and water features due to their ability to thrive in moist to aquatic conditions. Their aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits make them important in horticultural practices for both ornamental and environmental purposes.</p>
<p>Acorus angustatus remains a valuable plant in the landscape design of ponds, bog gardens, and shaded areas.</p>
