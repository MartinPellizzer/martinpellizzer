                <h1>Acorus angustatus</h1>
<p>Acorus angustatus, commonly known as narrow-leaved sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are typically sword-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green spathes that enclose its spores, which are dispersed by wind. Acorus angustatus is often found in still or slow-moving water, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus angustatus has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes whitish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, light green bark that grows from the base of the plant. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, arranged in a spadix surrounded by a leaf-like bract, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed berry that ripens in late summer, dispersing seeds by water and animals.</p>
<p>Its roots are rhizomatous, forming dense underground networks that help anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus angustatus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, Japan, Korea, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats, including marshes, ponds, and the edges of streams. This plant thrives in moist to submerged soils and is often associated with freshwater environments. It is also present in some regions of Australia and has been introduced to other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Acorus angustatus is known for its narrow, grass-like leaves and its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus angustatus was mainly introduced to aquatic and wetland environments, where it thrives in shallow water and moist soil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams and rivers. This plant is known for its narrow, grass-like leaves and its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions. It serves as a habitat for various aquatic organisms and can help stabilize shorelines.</p>
<p>However, its introduction can sometimes lead to competition with native species in certain regions.</p>
