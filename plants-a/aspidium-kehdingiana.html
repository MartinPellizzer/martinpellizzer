<p>Aspidium kehdingiana, commonly known as the Kehding's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic habitats.</p>
