<p>Acer pictum var. mono, commonly known as the single-leaf maple, is a rare variant of the striped maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring a single, large leaf per stem, unlike the typical clustered leaves of its parent species. The leaves are usually palmately lobed with a striking contrast of green and gold on the upper and lower surfaces. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to specific regions of eastern North America.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and distinctive appearance, it is often sought after by botanists and horticulturists.</p>
