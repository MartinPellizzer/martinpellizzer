                    <h1>Aspidium keckii</h1>
<p>Aspidium keckii, commonly known as the Keck's water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread across wetland habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium keckii plays an important ecological role in aquatic and semi-aquatic environments by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
