<p>Annesorhiza articulata, commonly known as the articulated sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Annesorhiza articulata is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
