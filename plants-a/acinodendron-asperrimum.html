                <h1>Acinodendron asperrimum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron asperrimum, commonly known as the rough acinodendron, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and clustered, small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered with a rough, waxy texture.</p>
<p>Acinodendron asperrimum typically grows in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron asperrimum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color, and it grows in a sprawling or shrub-like manner. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in rocky or arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron asperrimum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in lowland rainforests and secondary forests. This plant is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is typically associated with disturbed habitats and can be seen in both natural and cultivated environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to the Asian region, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron asperrimum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of an ornamental plant collection. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas of the country. It is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has minimal impact on native ecosystems.</p>
