                    <h1>Astragalus noeanus</h1>
<p>Astragalus noeanus, commonly known as the Negev milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, and it has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus noeanus is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
