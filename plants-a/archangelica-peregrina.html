                    <h1>Archangelica peregrina</h1>
<p>Archangelica peregrina, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its massive, umbrella-shaped flowers and highly lobed leaves.</p>
<p>Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can grow up to 5 meters in height. Its stems are covered in purple spots and have coarse hairs, while its leaves can reach lengths of over 1 meter. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, greenish-brown fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it is considered an invasive species in many regions and requires caution when handling.</p>
