                    <h1>Ananas var. viridis</h1>
<p>Ananas var. viridis, commonly known as the green pineapple, is a unique variant of the pineapple plant characterized by its predominantly green leaves and reduced fruit size compared to the typical yellow pineapple.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, specifically Brazil, and thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. The plant features a rosette of stiff, spiky leaves that form a tight cluster, with a central stem that eventually produces a small, edible fruit. While it lacks the vibrant coloration of the standard pineapple, it is prized for its ornamental value and mild flavor.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than commercial fruit production.</p>
