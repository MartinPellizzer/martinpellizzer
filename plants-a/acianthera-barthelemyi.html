                <h1>Acianthera barthelemyi</h1>
<p>Acianthera barthelemyi, commonly known as the Barthelemy's acianthera, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera barthelemyi has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat hairy, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, with a three-lobed lip, and they bloom in late spring to early summer, likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera barthelemyi is primarily native to French Guiana.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the dense tropical rainforests of the region. It thrives in humid and shaded environments within the understory of the forest canopy. The plant is part of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its small, delicate flowers.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats in French Guiana, making it a rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera barthelemyi was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the wild in the early 2000s and has since spread to other regions within its native range. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, vacant lots, and open woods. Its rapid growth and ability to produce numerous seeds contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas due to its competitive nature.</p>
