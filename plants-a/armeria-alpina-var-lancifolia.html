                    <h1>Armeria alpina var. lancifolia</h1>
<p>Armeria alpina var. lancifolia, commonly known as the Alpine thrift, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces dense clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest.</p>
