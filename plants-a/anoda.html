                    <h1>Anoda</h1>
<p>Anoda, commonly known as the "butterfly plant," is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plants are characterized by their showy, often pink or purple flowers that attract pollinators like butterflies and bees. Anoda species typically grow as annuals or perennials, with some varieties being cultivated for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually trifoliate, and the plant has a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
