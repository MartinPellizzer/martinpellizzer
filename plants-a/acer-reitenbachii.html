                        <h1>Acer reitenbachii</h1>
<p>Acer reitenbachii, commonly known as the Reitenbach maple, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and appear in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, Acer reitenbachii is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical collections.</p>
