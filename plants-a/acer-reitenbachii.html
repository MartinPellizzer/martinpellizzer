                <h1>Acer reitenbachii</h1>
<p>Acer reitenbachii, commonly known as the Reitenbach maple, is a rare and ornamental species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which turns vibrant shades of crimson in the fall. The plant has palmate leaves with five lobes, and its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and appear in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer reitenbachii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in corymbs, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersing by wind due to the gliding structure of the wings.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer reitenbachii is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>Its native range includes the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, where it thrives in temperate forests. Currently, its distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in the Hengduan Mountains. It grows in moist, well-drained soils at altitudes between 1,800 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer reitenbachii is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer reitenbachii is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its striking red foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-hardwood cuttings taken in late summer or by seed, though the latter method is less common due to its slow germination. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soil, requiring regular watering during dry periods.</p>
<p>Fertilize it lightly in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer reitenbachii is a small, ornamental maple that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its aesthetic and ecological value. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system, which stabilizes soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence supports a healthy ecosystem by offering habitat and resources to a range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer reitenbachii is a rare and ornamental maple species primarily valued for its unique foliage and aesthetic appeal, making it a popular choice in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas in some cultures. In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, though research is limited. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and ecological balance in its native habitats, supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and natural beauty, often inspiring art and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer reitenbachii has several notable cultivars, including 'Variegatum' and 'Atrosanguineum', which are prized for their striking foliage and unique coloration.</p>
<p>The species is also the parent of several hybrids, such as Acer x pensylvanicum, which combines the ornamental traits of Acer reitenbachii with those of other maple species. These hybrids are often used in horticulture for their adaptability and visual appeal in gardens. Due to its aesthetic qualities, Acer reitenbachii plays an important role in landscape design and ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids contribute to the diversity of maple trees available for cultivation in various climates.</p>
