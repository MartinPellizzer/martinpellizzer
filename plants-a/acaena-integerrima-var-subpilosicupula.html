                <h1>Acaena integerrima var. subpilosicupula</h1>
<p>Acaena integerrima var. subpilosicupula, commonly known as the silky burr plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces spherical, bristly fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests and coastal areas, and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The silky burr plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural use.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acaena integerrima var. subpilosicupula has compound leaves that are typically alternate, with ovate to elliptic leaflets, usually ranging from 1 to 3 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it exhibits a creeping growth habit with upright flowering shoots. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense heads, blooming in spring, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry, spherical achene enclosed in a persistent, hairy bract, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to the lightweight nature of the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena integerrima var. subpilosicupula is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand, specifically found in the South Island.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Australia, particularly in Tasmania and the southeastern regions, where it has been introduced. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in open vegetation such as scrublands and coastal areas. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is listed as a potential environmental weed, and its conservation status varies depending on the region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acaena integerrima var. subpilosicupula is a low-growing shrub native to South America, known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for improved germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 2-3 years, and prefers well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Regular watering is needed during the growing season, though it becomes drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications in spring, and pruning is recommended to maintain shape and encourage flowering. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or sedum can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acaena integerrima var. subpilosicupula is a low-growing shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, clustered flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and fertility.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acaena integerrima var. subpilosicupula is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand, known for its edible berries that have been traditionally used in Māori cuisine.</p>
<p>The berries are often consumed raw or cooked and are valued for their unique flavor and nutritional content. In traditional Māori medicine, various parts of the plant have been used to treat ailments such as skin conditions and digestive issues. Industrially, the plant contributes to local biodiversity and supports pollinators, enhancing ecological resilience.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds significant symbolic value within Māori traditions and is often associated with the landscape and heritage of New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
