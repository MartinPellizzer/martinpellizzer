<p>Acaena integerrima var. subpilosicupula, commonly known as the silky burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, prickly seed heads that form spherical clusters, which are adapted for wind dispersal. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Its woody stems are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence, giving it its varietal name.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena integerrima var. subpilosicupula is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as shrublands and grasslands. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and is often found in areas with low rainfall.</p>
<p>The variety is known for its dense, spiny growth and is an important component of the local flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena integerrima var. subpilosicupula was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a potential ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. The plant spreads rapidly through its seeds, which are dispersed by birds and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread.</p>
