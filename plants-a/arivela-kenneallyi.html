                    <h1>Arivela kenneallyi</h1>
<p>Arivela kenneallyi, commonly known as the Kenneally's arivela, is a rare and unique plant species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers during the cooler months, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Arivela kenneallyi is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
