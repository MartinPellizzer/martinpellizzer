                    <h1>Alnus serrulata</h1>
<p>Alnus serrulata, commonly known as the smooth alder, is a deciduous tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, serrated leaves and small, cone-like fruits that mature in the fall. The tree thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. It has a shallow root system that makes it susceptible to windthrow but also allows it to colonize disturbed sites quickly.</p>
<p>Alnus serrulata plays an important role in ecological succession and provides habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
