                <h1>Acinodendron eriodontum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron eriodontum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody structure. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a smooth texture, while its bark is thick and reddish in color.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its durable wood, which has been historically used in construction and furniture making.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron eriodontum has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dull green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal spikes, with a yellowish-green color, and they bloom in late spring to early summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron eriodontum is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as chaparral, woodlands, and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in regions with mild, Mediterranean climates characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. It is often associated with disturbed soils and can be found in areas with sparse vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron eriodontum was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind and water, contributing to its rapid establishment in new environments. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and minimize ecological impacts.</p>
