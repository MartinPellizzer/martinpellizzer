                <h1>Acianthera strupifolia</h1>
<p>Acianthera strupifolia, commonly known as the purple-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet and white flowers with prominent purple veins. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera strupifolia has elongated, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers with three petals and a spurred lip, blooming in early summer, and is pollinated primarily by bees. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera strupifolia is primarily native to Brazil South and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans these regions. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soil. The plant is often associated with rocky outcrops and shaded understories in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera strupifolia was mainly introduced to the Southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with abundant moisture. Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in the regions where it has been introduced.</p>
