<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Africa. This plant thrives in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate and well-drained soils. It is often associated with dry, open habitats and can be found in both natural and degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Acacia giraffae plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia giraffae was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Somalia. This plant is often used for its timber and as a source of fodder for livestock. Its introduction has also contributed to soil stabilization in degraded landscapes.</p>
