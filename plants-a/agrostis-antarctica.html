                    <h1>Agrostis antarctica</h1>
<p>Agrostis antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic hair grass, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of Antarctica and sub-Antarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in harsh, icy environments with minimal soil. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny seeds. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing the fragile soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive extreme cold and nutrient-poor conditions makes it a resilient example of botanical adaptation.</p>
