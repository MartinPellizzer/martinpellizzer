                <h1>Acrocarpus grandis</h1>
<p>Acrocarpus grandis, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it a striking appearance. The tree has a straight trunk and can reach heights of up to 30 meters, making it a dominant species in its habitat. Its leaves are alternate and pinnate, with a leathery texture that helps it withstand humid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus grandis has lanceolate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 10–20 cm in length and 2–4 cm in width.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a tall, slender tree. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellowish-white petals and stamens, blooming from December to February, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a drupe, typically red when ripe, containing a single seed that is dispersed by animals feeding on the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the tree and helping it thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus grandis is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across parts of tropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forests. This species thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in mixed dipterocarp forests. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, Acrocarpus grandis is listed as a vulnerable species in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus grandis is a fast-growing, medium-sized tree native to Southeast Asia, commonly cultivated for its timber and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings often yielding better results due to their higher survival rate. The growth cycle of Acrocarpus grandis is rapid, with significant height and width gain within a few years under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and remove dead or diseased branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally suffer from fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can enhance soil fertility and support its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus grandis is a valuable tropical tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing soil health and promoting the growth of other crops. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system, which stabilizes soil and prevents runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acrocarpus grandis contributes to carbon sequestration, helping to mitigate climate change impacts in tropical ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus grandis is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications.</p>
<p>Its wood is highly valued in the industrial and economic sectors for furniture, construction, and flooring due to its strength and durability.
