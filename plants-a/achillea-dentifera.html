                <h1>Achillea dentifera</h1>
<p>Achillea dentifera, commonly known as the toothed yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of finely divided, serrated leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Achillea dentifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea dentifera has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, serrated, and arranged in a rosette, with a dark green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green color, growing from the base to form a flowering stalk. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite heads arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea dentifera is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, specifically found in parts of southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other areas, including the United States and New Zealand, where it is sometimes cultivated. It thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils, typically in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. This species grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted native range and potential for invasive growth in non-native areas, it is considered a species of concern in some regions, though its conservation status varies by location.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea dentifera is a hardy perennial herb known for its finely toothed leaves and bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the root clumps or by sowing seeds in early spring. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering. Fertilization should be done in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with other drought-tolerant plants like lavender and yarrow in companion planting.</p>
