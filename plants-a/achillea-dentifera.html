                <h1>Achillea dentifera</h1>
<p>Achillea dentifera, commonly known as the serrated yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, serrated leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea dentifera is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea dentifera has basal,丛生 leaves that are lanceolate to oblanceolate in shape, with a serrated margin and a bluish-green color, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and reddish-brown in color, with a growth pattern that is usually clump-forming. The flowers are compound umbels of tiny white to pale yellow florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea dentifera is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to specific areas in southern Italy, Greece, and Turkey. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and wastelands, often growing in full sun. This species is typically found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea dentifera is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea dentifera is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a long growth cycle, blooming from late spring to early autumn, with a dormant period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea dentifera is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting beneficial insect populations. Its dense growth also helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea dentifera contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by promoting pollination and supporting food webs.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea dentifera is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, known for its aromatic leaves and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has been used historically in traditional medicine to treat digestive issues and skin conditions due to its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. In culinary applications, its leaves are sometimes used as a seasoning, similar to parsley, adding a fresh, slightly bitter flavor to dishes. Culturally, it has symbolic significance in some regions, often associated with healing and protection.</p>
<p>However, its industrial and economic applications are limited, as it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea dentifera has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' and 'Lilacina', which are known for their bright yellow and soft lilac flowers, respectively. Hybrids of Achillea dentifera are often developed to enhance bloom color, flower size, and disease resistance. These plants are important in horticulture for their ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and their long-lasting floral displays.</p>
<p>Their use in gardens and landscapes contributes to their widespread cultivation and appreciation among gardeners.</p>
