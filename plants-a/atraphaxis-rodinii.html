<p>Atraphaxis rodinii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features include a taproot system and hairy foliage, which aid in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Atraphaxis rodinii is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
