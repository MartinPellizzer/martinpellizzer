                    <h1>Ajax patulus</h1>
<p>Ajax patulus, commonly known as the slender arrowhead, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that resemble arrows, often floating on the water's surface or partially submerged. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its water habitat. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in shallow waters.</p>
<p>Ajax patulus is often used in water gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
