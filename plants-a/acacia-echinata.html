<p>Acacia echinata, commonly known as the spiny acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its bark is typically greyish or brown. Acacia echinata is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
