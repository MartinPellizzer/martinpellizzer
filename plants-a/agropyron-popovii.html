<p>Agropyron popovii, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agropyron popovii is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
