                    <h1>Arenaria lithophila</h1>
<p>Arenaria lithophila, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, often found on cliffs, rock faces, and dry slopes. Its succulent leaves help it store water, enabling survival in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria lithophila is valued for its resilience and is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
