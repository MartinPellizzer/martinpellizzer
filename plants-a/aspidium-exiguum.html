                    <h1>Aspidium exiguum</h1>
<p>Aspidium exiguum, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a diminutive fern species belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically measure less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Aspidium exiguum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and compact size make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
