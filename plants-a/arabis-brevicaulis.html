<p>Arabis brevicaulis, commonly known as the shortstem rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with a compact rosette of basal leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, usually in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Arabis brevicaulis is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained environments.</p>
