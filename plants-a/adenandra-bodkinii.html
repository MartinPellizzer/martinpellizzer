<p>Adenandra bodkinii, commonly known as the Cape chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and alternate, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellow, urn-shaped flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds.</p>
<p>Adenandra bodkinii is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra bodkinii has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm long and arranged along the stems in a spiral pattern. The stems are slender, woody, and have a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in late winter to early spring, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
