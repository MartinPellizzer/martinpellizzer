                    <h1>Aspidium spinulosum</h1>
<p>Aspidium spinulosum, commonly known as the spinulose water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, spinulose (spiny) pinnae that give the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>
