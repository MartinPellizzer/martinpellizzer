                <h1>Ada mendozae</h1>
<p>Ada mendozae, commonly known as the Mendoza's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink flowers with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, thriving in the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, a feature common in epiphytic orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ada mendozae is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Ada mendozae has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with purple petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Ada mendozae is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico, specifically in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas.</p>
<p>This species thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, where it benefits from the cool, moist climate. It is commonly found in rocky soils and among dense vegetation in these biodiverse habitats. Due to its limited range, Ada mendozae is considered a rare and endemic plant.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Ada mendozae was mainly introduced to regions with Mediterranean climates, characterized by mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for rocky or coastal areas. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental species due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. However, it has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
