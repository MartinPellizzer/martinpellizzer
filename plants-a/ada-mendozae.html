<p>Ada mendozae, commonly known as the Mendoza's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink flowers with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, thriving in the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, a feature common in epiphytic orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ada mendozae is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
