                    <h1>Anginon difforme</h1>
<p>Anginon difforme, commonly known as the variable anginon, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize moist environments effectively. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Anginon difforme is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
