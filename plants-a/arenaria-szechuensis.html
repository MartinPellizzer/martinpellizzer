<p>Arenaria szechuensis, commonly known as the Sichuan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with numerous small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Arenaria szechuensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
