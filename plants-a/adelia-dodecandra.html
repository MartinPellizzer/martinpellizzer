                <h1>Adelia dodecandra</h1>
<p>Adelia dodecandra, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in shrubland and grassland habitats, often in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and branching.</p>
<p>Adelia dodecandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and floral arrangements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia dodecandra has elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals with yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia dodecandra is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in warm, moist environments and is often associated with secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and possibly other nearby islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific regions within the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia dodecandra was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive yellow flowers and foliage. The plant has since become naturalized in some areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. It is often found growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
