                <h1>Aegiceras majus</h1>
<p>Aegiceras majus, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests along tidal estuaries. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its saline habitat. Its fruit, which resembles a small apple, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor.</p>
<p>Aegiceras majus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiceras majus has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5-10 cm long and arranged spirally along the stem. The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from April to June and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
