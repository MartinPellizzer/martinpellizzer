                <h1>Acosta pseudobovina</h1>
<p>Acosta pseudobovina, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth texture.</p>
<p>Acosta pseudobovina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta pseudobovina has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exhibits a slightly ridged texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta pseudobovina is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude environments, including cloud forests and rocky mountainous areas. This plant thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often associated with elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta pseudobovina was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant has become a common weed in agricultural and urban landscapes due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds. Its introduction has led to competition with native vegetation in some regions.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used for erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
