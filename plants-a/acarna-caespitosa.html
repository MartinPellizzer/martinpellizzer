                        <h1>Acarna caespitosa</h1>
<p>Acarna caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for wetland restoration projects and ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acarna caespitosa is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Peru, and Colombia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is often part of the understory vegetation in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic regions within South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acarna caespitosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. The plant spreads through both seeds and rhizomes, contributing to its rapid colonization of new habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain environments.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate ecological impacts.</p>
