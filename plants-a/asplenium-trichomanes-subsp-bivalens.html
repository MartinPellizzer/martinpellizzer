<p>Asplenium trichomanes subsp.</p>
<p>bivalens, commonly known as the bivalve spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors.</p>
<p>The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its distinctive leaf morphology, which gives it its common name.</p>
