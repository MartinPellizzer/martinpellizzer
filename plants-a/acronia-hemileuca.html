                <h1>Acronia hemileuca</h1>
<p>Acronia hemileuca, commonly known as the white-veined acronia, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves with white veins and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia hemileuca has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length. The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical dispersal as the pod splits open.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia hemileuca is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant thrives in areas with consistently moist soil and high humidity. It is often associated with pine flatwoods and other forested wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia hemileuca was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and moderate to dry conditions. The plant has been observed spreading rapidly in regions where its seeds are dispersed by wind and animals. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is now considered an invasive species in several regions outside its native range.</p>
