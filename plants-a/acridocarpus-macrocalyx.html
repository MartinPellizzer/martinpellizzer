                <h1>Acridocarpus macrocalyx</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus macrocalyx, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a striking visual display. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture-making.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus macrocalyx has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicle-like inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus macrocalyx is primarily native to Cameroon, Central African Republic, DR Congo, Gabon, Guinea, Nigeria, and Togo.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of these regions. It thrives in humid and warm climates with high rainfall. The species is commonly found in lowland areas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus macrocalyx was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests where it thrives in humid, warm climates. This plant has been introduced to several Pacific islands, including Hawaii and parts of Southeast Asia. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to concerns about its invasive potential in some regions.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent ecological disruption in non-native habitats.</p>
