                <h1>Acrostichum minutum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum minutum, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lace-like fronds that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize areas effectively.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its small, spore-bearing structures called sori.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum minutum has fern-like leaves that are linear, narrow, and finely divided, arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green color and a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-yellow in color, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a cluster of dry, spore-bearing structures, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum minutum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. This fern thrives in areas with high humidity and consistent moisture. Its distribution includes countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in the Caribbean islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum minutum was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas, such as roadsides, construction sites, and abandoned lots.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and can tolerate partial shade. This plant spreads rapidly through rhizomes, making it a potential invasive species in certain ecosystems. It is often found in the southeastern United States and has been reported in several states.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecological balances.</p>
