<p>Andryala arenaria subsp.</p>
<p>arenaria, commonly known as the sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact rosette of silver-gray, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate salt and drought makes it an important species in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
