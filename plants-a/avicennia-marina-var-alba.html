                    <h1>Avicennia marina var. alba</h1>
<p>Avicennia marina var. alba, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic species adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant's leaves are thick and waxy, reducing water loss and enabling survival in coastal areas. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and estuarine organisms.</p>
<p>Its flowering and fruiting patterns are influenced by tidal cycles and seasonal changes.</p>
