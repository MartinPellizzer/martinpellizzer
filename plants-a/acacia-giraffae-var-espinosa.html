                        <h1>Acacia giraffae var. espinosa</h1>
<p>Acacia giraffae var. espinosa, commonly known as the spineless acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless branches and feathery, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in cylindrical spikes, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, woody pods that split open when mature.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited to harsh environments and is sometimes used for soil stabilization and as a source of browse for livestock.</p>
