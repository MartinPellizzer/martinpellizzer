<p>Austroblechnum norfolkianum, commonly known as the Norfolk Island holly fern, is a species of fern native to Norfolk Island.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are deeply divided. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky or coastal substrates. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat.</p>
<p>The species is of conservation interest due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
