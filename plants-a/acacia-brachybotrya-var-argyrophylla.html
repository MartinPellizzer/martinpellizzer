<p>Acacia brachybotrya var. argyrophylla, commonly known as the silver-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions.</p>
<p>The species is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
