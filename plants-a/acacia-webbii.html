                    <h1>Acacia webbii</h1>
<p>Acacia webbii, commonly known as the Sudanese acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by long, thin pods containing seeds. Acacia webbii is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a thick, waxy cuticle to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert species.</p>
