                        <h1>Acacia webbii</h1>
<p>Acacia webbii, commonly known as the Sudanese acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures.
