                <h1>Adenosma retusiloba</h1>
<p>Adenosma retusiloba, commonly known as the rough-leaved adenosma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Adenosma retusiloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma retusiloba has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, herbaceous, and covered with fine hairs, exhibiting a light green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring five pink to purple petals, five stamens, and a yellow pistil, blooming from March to May and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma retusiloba is primarily native to China South-Central and China Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is found in regions of China that include the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous areas. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic regions within southern and central China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma retusiloba was mainly introduced to the Greater Sydney region of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the eastern coast. This plant has become established in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and urban areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to spread and compete with native flora.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its distribution to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
