                    <h1>Alcantarea paniculata</h1>
<p>Alcantarea paniculata, commonly known as the pineapple plant or Brazilian pineapple, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of thick, waxy, sword-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red or purple. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, white, bell-shaped flowers. After flowering, it develops a fleshy, pineapple-like fruit that is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil.</p>
