<p>Athenaea peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian angel's trumpet, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant is evergreen, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care.</p>
