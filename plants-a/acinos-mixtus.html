                <h1>Acinos mixtus</h1>
<p>Acinos mixtus, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, aiding in water retention and protection from harsh weather.</p>
<p>Acinos mixtus plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing food for various pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos mixtus has compound leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are usually gray-green in color and have a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is wiry and somewhat succulent, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows in a prostrate or ascending manner. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are small, winged, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or dry soils.</p>
