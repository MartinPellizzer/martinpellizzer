<p>Atractylis babelii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse easily.</p>
<p>Atractylis babelii is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
