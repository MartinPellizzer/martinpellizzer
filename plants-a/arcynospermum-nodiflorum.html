                    <h1>Arcynospermum nodiflorum</h1>
<p>Arcynospermum nodiflorum, commonly known as the clustered-flowered cycad, is a unique member of the cycad family, characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves.</p>
<p>It produces cones rather than flowers, with the female cones typically larger and more clustered than the male ones. The plant is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with the male cones producing pollen and the female cones developing into seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental and scientific value.</p>
