<p>Anthericum limaense var. arequipaense, commonly known as the Arequipa lily, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of southern Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a colorful spathe. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
