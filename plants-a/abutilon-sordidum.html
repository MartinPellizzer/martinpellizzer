                        <h1>Abutilon sordidum</h1>
<p>Abutilon sordidum, commonly known as the dirty abutilon, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Central and South America, particularly regions with tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a waxy texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, and it is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Abutilon sordidum is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive foliage and adaptability to various growing environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon sordidum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and KwaZulu-Natal. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. It is commonly found in fynbos vegetation, which is characteristic of the region.</p>
<p>Abutilon sordidum is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of South Africa, with dry summers and wet winters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon sordidum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was primarily introduced as an ornamental plant due to its unique, fuzzy foliage and showy yellow flowers. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become a problematic invasive species in several areas. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and animals.</p>
<p>Its aggressive growth can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological imbalances in local ecosystems.</p>
