                <h1>Acer × neglectum</h1>
<p>Acer × neglectum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Acer palmatum and Acer kinusasekis. The plant is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that display vibrant colors in autumn, ranging from red to orange and yellow. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it suitable for small spaces and container gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × neglectum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–8 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to stabilize the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × neglectum is a hybrid maple species native to eastern Asia, specifically China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in these regions, it is now widely cultivated and distributed across temperate regions worldwide, including North America and Europe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, commonly found in forest understories. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its wild populations are relatively rare, and it is primarily maintained through horticultural cultivation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × neglectum is a hybrid maple tree known for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining specific cultivar traits. This tree has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 10 to 20 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilize it lightly in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead or diseased branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support biodiversity in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer × neglectum is a decorative shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to biodiversity in local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of nearby flora through improved soil conditions. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer × neglectum is a decorative plant primarily used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive, often colorful foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas in certain regions. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for potential antioxidant properties, though its use is limited compared to other species. Industrially, it contributes to the timber and paper industries when grown in suitable conditions.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is appreciated in garden design and may hold symbolic significance in local traditions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer × neglectum has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Aconitifolium' with its striking dark green foliage and 'Atrosanguineum' known for its red-veined leaves.</p>
<p>This species is also the parent of several hybrids, such as Acer × carpinifolium, which combines the characteristics of Acer negundo and Acer pseudoplatanus. The plant's adaptability to different soil types and climates contributes to its horticultural importance. It is commonly used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and resilience.</p>
<p>Its popularity in gardens and parks highlights its role in modern horticulture.</p>
