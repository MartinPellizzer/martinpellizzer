<p>Aldama brandegeei, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Aldama brandegeei plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing forage for small wildlife.</p>
