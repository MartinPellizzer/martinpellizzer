                    <h1>Atomostigma</h1>
<p>Atomostigma, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly in countries like India, China, and Indonesia. They are characterized by their striking, star-shaped flowers that often display vibrant yellow or golden hues. The leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a glossy surface that helps in photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Atomostigma species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or other structures, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
