                    <h1>Allium africanum</h1>
<p>Allium africanum, commonly known as the African garlic, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a bulbous stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its strong, pungent odor, similar to that of garlic, due to the presence of sulfur-containing compounds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Allium africanum is valued not only for its culinary uses but also for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties.</p>
