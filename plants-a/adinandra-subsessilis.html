                <h1>Adinandra subsessilis</h1>
<p>Adinandra subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its hard wood, it has been historically used in construction and tool-making.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra subsessilis has simple, elliptic leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are medium in size, typically measuring around 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra subsessilis is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. The plant is typically found in lowland to mid-elevation areas, often growing as an understory species. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Borneo, making it a regionally significant flora.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it may be at risk of decline in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra subsessilis was mainly introduced to coastal and lowland forest areas in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. This plant is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks where it can establish itself quickly. Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
