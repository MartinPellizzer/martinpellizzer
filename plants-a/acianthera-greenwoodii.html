                <h1>Acianthera greenwoodii</h1>
<p>Acianthera greenwoodii, commonly known as the Greenwood's acianthera, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant features slender, erect stems and produces small, fragrant orchid-like flowers in shades of white and green. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>Acianthera greenwoodii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera greenwoodii has elliptical, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth texture and a moderate size of about 5-7 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly hairy texture and a light greenish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, with a tubular structure and three petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that contains tiny seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera greenwoodii is primarily native to Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. The plant thrives in rocky and limestone soils. It is commonly associated with scrublands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within this geographic range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera greenwoodii was mainly introduced to areas with humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly associated with disturbed sites such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned fields. The plant thrives in environments with high light exposure and moderate to high rainfall. Its introduction has been linked to both natural dispersal and human activities like horticulture and land development.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in several regions outside its native range.</p>
