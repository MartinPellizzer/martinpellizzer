<p>Aspidium flexum, commonly known as the flexible water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or near water sources. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering.</p>
<p>Aspidium flexum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
