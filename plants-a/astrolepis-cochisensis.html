<p>Astrolepis cochisensis, commonly known as the Cochise featherplant, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers on slender stems, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Astrolepis cochisensis is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
