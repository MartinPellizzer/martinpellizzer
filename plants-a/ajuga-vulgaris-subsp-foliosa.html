<p>Ajuga vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>foliosa, commonly known as carpet bugle or broadleaf ajuga, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense mat of dark green, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often broader than those of the typical *Ajuga vulgaris*.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick ground cover, making it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental gardening.</p>
