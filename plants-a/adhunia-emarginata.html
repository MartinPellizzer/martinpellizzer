<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhunia emarginata has compound leaves that are pinnate, with lanceolate leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length and displaying a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with five petals, blooming during the summer months, and is primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhunia emarginata is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly found in regions of India, Nepal, and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Southeast Asia, where it has been introduced and naturalized. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories. The plant is typically found at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and limited threats, Adhunia emarginata is currently listed as a species of least concern in terms of conservation status.</p>
