                    <h1>Argyroxiphium sandwicense</h1>
<p>Argyroxiphium sandwicense, commonly known as the Haleakalā silversword, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces a single, tall inflorescence with yellow flowers during its brief flowering period. It thrives in the high-altitude, rocky habitats of Haleakalā's summit.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is a symbol of Hawaii's unique biodiversity.</p>
