                <h1>Adiantum muelleri</h1>
<p>Adiantum muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive frond structure that allows for efficient water retention.</p>
<p>Adiantum muelleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum muelleri has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a delicate, lacy appearance and a light green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically triangular in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and can reach up to 30 cm in length. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a creeping or upright pattern depending on the environment. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures rather than true flowers, and does not have showy flowers or a blooming period.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces via spores, and its roots are fibrous, helping to anchor it in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum muelleri is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments. This fern prefers rocky or forested areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is particularly associated with the northeastern regions of India, such as Assam and Manipur.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also reported in some parts of Australia, though it is more commonly linked to its native range in Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum muelleri was mainly introduced to urban and suburban gardens in Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is valued for its delicate, fern-like foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments. The plant is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental appeal, it has been cultivated in horticultural collections across the Pacific region.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in natural ecosystems.</p>
