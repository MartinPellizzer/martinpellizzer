                <h1>Acosta cristata</h1>
<p>Acosta cristata, commonly known as the cristate acosta, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive crown-like inflorescence. The plant features showy, brightly colored flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of pink and purple. Its leaves are typically palmate, with lobed edges that contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Acosta cristata is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta cristata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that has a slight ribbed texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta cristata is primarily native to the high Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and alpine environments at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters above sea level. This plant thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, often growing on cliffs or slopes. It is part of the Apiaceae family and is known for its distinctive, finely divided leaves and small white or yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Acosta cristata is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta cristata was mainly introduced to the Pacific coast of South America, particularly in countries such as Peru and Chile.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils along the shoreline. This plant has adapted well to the salty and windy conditions of its new habitat. It plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant species.</p>
