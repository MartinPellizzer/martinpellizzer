                    <h1>Alatoseta</h1>
<p>Alatoseta, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Alatoseta is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and resilience make it a notable species in its native habitat.</p>
