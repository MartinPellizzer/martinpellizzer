<p>Aegilops aucheri var. hirtohispida, commonly known as the hairy spikelet wild oat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive hairy lemma and palea on its spikelets. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are often mistaken for true grasses due to their similar appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and agricultural weed management.</p>
