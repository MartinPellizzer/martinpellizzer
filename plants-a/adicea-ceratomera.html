                <h1>Adicea ceratomera</h1>
<p>Adicea ceratomera, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its striking, horn-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adicea ceratomera is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea ceratomera has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows in a climbing or trailing pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring and summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea ceratomera is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas. The plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and partial to full sunlight. It is often associated with disturbed soils and can be found along forest edges or in secondary growth areas.</p>
<p>Adicea ceratomera is also present in some parts of Africa, particularly in tropical regions with similar climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea ceratomera was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found along riverbanks and wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it effective for reclaiming degraded land.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
