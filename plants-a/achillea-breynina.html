<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its foliage is aromatic and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea breynina has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a dark green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green color, growing from the base with a compact growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-white composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea breynina is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan and southern Russia.</p>
<p>It is currently found in a limited range, primarily in the alpine and subalpine zones of these areas. This species thrives in dry, rocky, and well-drained soils, often growing in open slopes and meadows. It is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population size, Achillea breynina is considered to be of conservation concern, though its exact status may vary by region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea breynina is a compact, flowering plant known for its delicate yellow blooms and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The growth cycle of Achillea breynina includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in mid to late summer, and a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring can enhance growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea breynina is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Achillea breynina also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea breynina is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, known for its medicinal properties.</p>
