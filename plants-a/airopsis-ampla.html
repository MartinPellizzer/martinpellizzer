<p>Airopsis ampla, commonly known as the giant sea lettuce, is a large, green algae that thrives in coastal marine environments.</p>
<p>It forms dense, sprawling mats on the seafloor, often in shallow, sheltered waters. The plant has a flattened, leaf-like structure that can grow up to several meters in length. It is characterized by its simple, unbranched thallus and lack of true roots or leaves.</p>
<p>Airopsis ampla plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
