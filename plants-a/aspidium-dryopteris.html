<p>Aspidium dryopteris, commonly known as the barren clubmoss, is a species of fern belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive, club-shaped spore-bearing structure called a strobilus. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures are tightly clustered, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Aspidium dryopteris is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
