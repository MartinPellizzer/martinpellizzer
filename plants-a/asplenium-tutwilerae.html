<p>Asplenium tutwilerae, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters.</p>
<p>Asplenium tutwilerae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions.</p>
