                <h1>Achillea eriophora</h1>
<p>Achillea eriophora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, linear leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Achillea eriophora is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea eriophora has leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, with a blue-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray flowers, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea eriophora is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of Tibet.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes scattered populations in arid and semi-arid regions of these areas, though it is less common today due to habitat loss. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is typically found in open grasslands and shrublands. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 4,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat degradation, Achillea eriophora is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea eriophora is a hardy perennial known for its ornamental foliage and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing established clumps in early spring. The plant has a slow growth cycle, maturing over several years, and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>It requires minimal watering once established and benefits from a light application of balanced fertilizer in the spring. Regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its compact shape, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea eriophora is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds and foliage for food and shelter. The plant acts as a companion plant in native landscapes, enhancing biodiversity and supporting ecological balance. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system, which stabilizes soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea eriophora contributes to the overall health of ecosystems by promoting soil moisture retention and offering habitat for beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
