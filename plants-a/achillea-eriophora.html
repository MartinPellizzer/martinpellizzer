                <h1>Achillea eriophora</h1>
<p>Achillea eriophora, commonly known as the woolly yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It produces small, disc-shaped flower heads that attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea eriophora has basal leaves that are gray-green in color, linear in shape, and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a hairy texture and small size.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with fine hairs, growing from the base of the plant. Its flowers are small, yellowish-white composite blooms arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea eriophora is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions such as Spain, Portugal, and southern France, where it thrives in specific environmental conditions. This plant prefers dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in open habitats like scrublands and coastal areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Achillea eriophora is considered to be of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea eriophora is a perennial plant known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with division being more reliable for maintaining the desired characteristics. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant phase in winter and active growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring helps promote healthy growth, while pruning dead foliage in late winter encourages new shoots. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea eriophora is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering food and shelter. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. It also contributes to erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea eriophora offers ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea eriophora is a flowering plant commonly known as the European yarrow.</p>
<p>It has been used historically in medicinal applications for its purported ability to stop bleeding and treat wounds, though its effectiveness in modern medicine is not well-supported. While it is not widely used in culinary contexts, some traditional recipes may incorporate its flowers for flavor.
