<p>Agropyron junceum subsp.</p>
<p>obtusiflorum, commonly known as the broad-flower wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish to brownish flowers. Its flowers are characterized by their broad, rounded lobes, which give the subspecies its common name.</p>
<p>This grass is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
