                <h1>Aegopogon avenaceus</h1>
<p>Aegopogon avenaceus, commonly known as the oat grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense spikes and bloom during the summer months.</p>
<p>Aegopogon avenaceus is known for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegopogon avenaceus has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring between 3 to 8 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat hairy, with a light green to brownish bark that becomes rougher with age, growing in a spreading or upright manner. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with white to pale blue petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
