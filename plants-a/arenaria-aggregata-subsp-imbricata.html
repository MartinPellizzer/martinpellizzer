<p>Arenaria aggregata subsp.</p>
<p>imbricata, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal areas. It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically on stems that rise from a dense mat of foliage.</p>
<p>The leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize sandy soils, making it a valuable plant in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
