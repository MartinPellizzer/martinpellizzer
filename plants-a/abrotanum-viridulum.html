                <h1>Abrotanum viridulum</h1>
<p>Abrotanum viridulum, commonly known as green hawksbeard, is an herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features yellow flowers arranged in a single, elongated head, which are borne on slender stems. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a rough texture and a distinct, sometimes aromatic scent.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abrotanum viridulum has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 2-5 cm long and 1-2 cm wide, with a smooth upper surface and a slightly hairy lower surface, displaying a dull green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a pale green to brownish color, growing in a bushy pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in loose inflorescences, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrotanum viridulum is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in regions such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of southern France.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other areas, including parts of the United States and Australia, where it is sometimes cultivated. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and wastelands, often in sunny and well-drained soils. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted native range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abrotanum viridulum is a hardy, low-maintenance plant commonly grown for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the plant's genetic traits. This annual plant has a rapid growth cycle, often completing its life cycle within a single growing season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation to prevent root rot. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding during the growing season, while pruning is usually unnecessary except to remove dead or damaged foliage. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like thyme or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abrotanum viridulum is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also attracts other wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which feed on its seeds or use it for shelter. The plant acts as a companion plant in some ecological settings, supporting the growth of neighboring species by improving soil conditions. Additionally, its dense growth habit helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and waterways.</p>
<p>Overall, Abrotanum viridulum plays a significant role in maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance in its habitat.</p>
