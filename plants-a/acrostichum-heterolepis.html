                <h1>Acrostichum heterolepis</h1>
<p>Acrostichum heterolepis, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. It produces showy, yellow flowers that are often followed by orange or red fruits.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in ornamental horticulture for its striking foliage and vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum heterolepis has large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically elongated and dark green, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and smooth, with a light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a clumping pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. Its fruit is a dark brown, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum heterolepis is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks where there is abundant moisture. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with coastal or lowland habitats. It is particularly common in the Caribbean, Brazil, and the eastern United States.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high rainfall and nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum heterolepis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and adaptability to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, marshes, and swampy habitats where it thrives in high humidity and moist soil conditions. This plant is often used in landscaping and restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
