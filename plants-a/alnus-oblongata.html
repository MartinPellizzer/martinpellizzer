                <h1>Alnus oblongata</h1>
<p>Alnus oblongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment.</p>
<p>Alnus oblongata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges and streamside habitats.</p>
