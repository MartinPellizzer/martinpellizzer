<p>Arundinella pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bamboo or hairy reed, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Arundinella pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber in some cultures.</p>
