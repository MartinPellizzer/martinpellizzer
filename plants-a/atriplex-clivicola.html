<p>Atriplex clivicola, commonly known as the cliff saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spine-tipped leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on rocky slopes and cliffs. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to grow in areas with high salinity, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Atriplex clivicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
