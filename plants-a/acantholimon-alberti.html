                        <h1>Acantholimon alberti</h1>
<p>Acantholimon alberti, commonly known as Albert's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with dense, woolly hairs that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>Acantholimon alberti is a hardy perennial that is well adapted to coastal conditions and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
