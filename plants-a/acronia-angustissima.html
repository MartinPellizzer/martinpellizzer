                <h1>Acronia angustissima</h1>
<p>Acronia angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf acronia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Acronia angustissima is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its aesthetic appeal in wetland gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia angustissima has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale pink, featuring five petals and a tubular shape, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia angustissima is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically found in parts of Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. It is commonly associated with areas that have consistently moist soil and high humidity. Acronia angustissima is often found in the Coastal Plain region, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, its distribution has become increasingly restricted in recent years.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia angustissima was mainly introduced to disturbed areas such as roadsides, waste grounds, and urban environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions. This plant is commonly found in coastal regions and can spread rapidly due to its prolific seed production. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently listed as a major invasive species in most regions.</p>
