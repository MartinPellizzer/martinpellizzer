                <h1>Acourtia aspera</h1>
<p>Acourtia aspera, commonly known as the rough acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, rough-textured leaves that help reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits.</p>
<p>Acourtia aspera is often found in coastal and inland deserts, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia aspera has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size and a dull green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, hairy texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright and branching sparingly. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in dry, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia aspera is primarily native to California and Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and coastal grassland habitats. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the Pacific coast. It is often seen in areas with mild, Mediterranean-type climates.</p>
<p>Acourtia aspera is an important species for local ecosystems and is sometimes used in restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia aspera was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and abandoned pastures.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in coastal and inland areas of California, particularly in the Central Valley and southern parts of the state. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and anthropogenic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
