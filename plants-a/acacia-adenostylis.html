                        <h1>Acacia adenostylis</h1>
<p>Acacia adenostylis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, feathery leaves that are typically green with a slight blue or gray tinge. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Acacia adenostylis is well adapted to sandy soils and coastal conditions, often thriving in areas with salt spray.</p>
<p>It is an important plant in the local ecosystem, providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for various insects and birds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia adenostylis is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically the states of New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with sandy soils, often in coastal areas and heathlands. This plant thrives in dry, open environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Australian landscape. It is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the unique ecological conditions of the eastern Australian coast.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia adenostylis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of acacia species for agricultural and horticultural purposes. This plant has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. It is particularly common in the North Island, where it thrives in a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
