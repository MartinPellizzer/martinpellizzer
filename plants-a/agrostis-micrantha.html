<p>Agrostis micrantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as meadows, roadsides, and fields. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Agrostis micrantha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
