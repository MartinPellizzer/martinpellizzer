                    <h1>Angostura marginata</h1>
<p>Angostura marginata, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive prop roots that extend into the water, aiding in stabilization and oxygen absorption. The plant has a thick, waxy leaf surface that helps reduce salt absorption from the humid environment. It produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by reddish-brown fruits containing a single seed.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
