<p>Amyema benthamii, commonly known as the Benthams' mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in Australia.</p>
<p>It has a small, inconspicuous appearance with green, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat its fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Amyema benthamii plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for native animals and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
