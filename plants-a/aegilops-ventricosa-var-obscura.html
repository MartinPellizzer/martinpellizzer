                    <h1>Aegilops ventricosa var. obscura</h1>
<p>Aegilops ventricosa var. obscura, commonly known as the dark spikelet wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and compact inflorescence with small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
