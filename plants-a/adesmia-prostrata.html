                <h1>Adesmia prostrata</h1>
<p>Adesmia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate adesmia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its pods are typically hairy and contain several seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Adesmia prostrata is used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia prostrata has prostrate growth habit with stems that are generally hairy and green, often lying close to the ground.</p>
<p>Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stems, and are usually green with a slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white or pale pink petals, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia prostrata is primarily native to Chile Central.</p>
<p>It is found in the central regions of Chile, particularly in the coastal areas and surrounding valleys. This plant thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall. It is commonly found in grasslands and open habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Chile Central.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia prostrata was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant forms dense mats that help prevent soil degradation and reduce wind erosion. It has also been introduced as a forage plant for livestock in some areas.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential in non-native habitats requires careful management.</p>
