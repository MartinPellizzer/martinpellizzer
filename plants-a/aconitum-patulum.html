                <h1>Aconitum patulum</h1>
<p>Aconitum patulum, commonly known as the broadleaf aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stems. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive, wavy margin.</p>
<p>Aconitum patulum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum patulum has basal leaves that are broadly ovate to kidney-shaped, with a deep green color and a waxy texture, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and dark purple to brown in color, with a hollow or slightly ridged texture, growing upwards from the rosette. The flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in a dense spike, blooming from late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds with a tuft of white hairs for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, serving as storage organs and anchoring the plant in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum patulum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of India.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. This plant is commonly associated with the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau, where it grows in moist, well-drained environments. It is also found in some areas of the Russian Far East and northern China.</p>
<p>Aconitum patulum is adapted to cold climates and is often part of the flora in mountain meadows and forest edges.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum patulum was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the 19th century by European settlers who admired its beauty. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a potential weed in some regions. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread through seed dispersal by birds and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems, leading to monitoring and management efforts.</p>
