                    <h1>Ascochilus</h1>
<p>Ascochilus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, often delicate and translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Ascochilus species are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, growing on trees or rocks in humid tropical environments. They have small, fleshy leaves and produce showy, fragrant blooms that attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, many Ascochilus species are threatened by habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
