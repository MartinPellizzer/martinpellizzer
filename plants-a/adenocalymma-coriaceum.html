                <h1>Adenocalymma coriaceum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma coriaceum, commonly known as the roughleaf sandmat, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy, woody stems that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of pubescence, providing additional protection against desiccation.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma coriaceum is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma coriaceum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color, growing in a shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma coriaceum is primarily native to Brazil Northeast and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is found in the northeastern and southeastern regions of Brazil. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical environments within these areas. The plant is adapted to the warm and humid climate of these regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma coriaceum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, spreading beyond cultivated areas and colonizing native habitats. The plant's rapid growth and ability to outcompete local vegetation have raised concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its effects on the environment.</p>
