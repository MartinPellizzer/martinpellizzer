                <h1>Achillea roseoalba</h1>
<p>Achillea roseoalba, commonly known as the white archangel, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disc florets. The plant features gray-green, silver-haired foliage and produces showy white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Achillea roseoalba is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea roseoalba has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation and measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a pale green to reddish-brown color, growing in a branching pattern that becomes more open as the plant matures. Its flowers are composite, consisting of white ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a cylindrical achene with a pappus, which is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea roseoalba is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, particularly found in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including some regions of Europe and North America, often as an ornamental plant. It thrives in dry, sunny environments, typically growing in rocky soils and alpine meadows. This species is commonly found at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and the impacts of habitat degradation, Achillea roseoalba is considered to be of conservation concern in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea roseoalba is a hardy perennial known for its delicate pinkish-white flowers and feathery foliage, often used in ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seeds sown in late summer. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, thriving in full sun and producing flowers in its second year.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune spent flower stems to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too damp.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea roseoalba is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by improving soil conditions. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>It also plays a role in supporting local ecosystems by offering shelter and habitat for small insects and invertebrates.</p>
