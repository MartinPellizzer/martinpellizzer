                <h1>Adelonema pallidinervium</h1>
<p>Adelonema pallidinervium, commonly known as the pale-veined adelonema, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with prominent, pale veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne on short peduncles. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>The species is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelonema pallidinervium has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a pale green color with prominent veins.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows in a spreading pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema pallidinervium is primarily native to Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This plant typically grows in humid, forested areas. It is commonly observed in the Andean foothills and lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Ecuador's biodiversity-rich ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema pallidinervium was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in Southeast Asia, including countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Its introduction is often associated with human activity, such as land clearing and gardening.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
