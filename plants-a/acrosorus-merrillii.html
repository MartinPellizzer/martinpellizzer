                <h1>Acrosorus merrillii</h1>
<p>Acrosorus merrillii, commonly known as the Singapore tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of fertile fronds that bear spore-bearing structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Acrosorus merrillii make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrosorus merrillii has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a creeping growth pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with three petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that disperse seeds by wind once they mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosorus merrillii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is often associated with the understory vegetation in these tropical habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosorus merrillii was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, particularly in regions with suitable tropical climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, clearings, and degraded forests. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has shown adaptability to different soil types. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several areas outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely undocumented.</p>
