                <h1>Aegiphila stricta</h1>
<p>Aegiphila stricta, commonly known as the rigid aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Aegiphila stricta is often found in moist, woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila stricta has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, consisting of five petals and stamens, and bloom in the spring; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
