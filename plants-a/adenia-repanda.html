                <h1>Adenia repanda</h1>
<p>Adenia repanda, commonly known as the smooth adenia, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite leaves. The leaves are usually ovate or elliptic in shape, with a smooth texture and a slightly glossy appearance. It produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright orange berries.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as rainforests and understoreys.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia repanda has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically greyish-brown in color, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains several elliptical seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, helping the plant store water and nutrients, especially in its native arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia repanda is primarily native to Angola, Botswana, Cape Provinces, Namibia, Northern Provinces, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in these regions across southern Africa. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky, or wooded areas. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Adenia repanda is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia repanda was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen growing along riverbanks and in forest margins. It is considered an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit.</p>
<p>However, it has also become naturalized in some regions, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
