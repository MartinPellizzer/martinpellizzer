<p>Aulomyrcia pirarensis, commonly known as the Pirar√© cypress, is a rare and endemic species native to the Brazilian state of Pernambuco.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen tree characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by wind, and its seeds are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is protected by conservation efforts in its native region.</p>
