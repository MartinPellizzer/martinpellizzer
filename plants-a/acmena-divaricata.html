                <h1>Acmena divaricata</h1>
<p>Acmena divaricata, commonly known as the glossy buckthorn, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Australia and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round, red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and forested areas.</p>
<p>Acmena divaricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena divaricata has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels, and bloom during the spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's climbing habit and providing anchorage.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena divaricata is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in subtropical and tropical rainforests, as well as in coastal areas and on rocky outcrops. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is a shrub or small tree that contributes to the biodiversity of these regions.</p>
<p>Acmena divaricata is also known by the common name "Coral Tree" due to its striking pink or red flower clusters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena divaricata was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is adapted to well-drained soils. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some native ecosystems, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its ecological impact remains under study in local biodiversity assessments.</p>
