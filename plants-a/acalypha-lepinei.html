                <h1>Acalypha lepinei</h1>
<p>Acalypha lepinei, commonly known as the flame bush, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fiery red bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture with a slightly waxy coating.</p>
<p>Acalypha lepinei thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha lepinei has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, and covered with a smooth, reddish-brown bark, growing in a spreading or upright manner depending on environmental conditions. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with greenish-white petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and enabling the plant to thrive in disturbed environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha lepinei is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar, where it grows in specific forested areas.</p>
<p>While it was once confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including tropical regions of Africa and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland to mid-elevation forests. Acalypha lepinei is usually found at altitudes between 0 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha lepinei is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant, feather-like foliage that adds a tropical flair to gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and follows a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and consistent watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or mealybugs in poor conditions, making companion planting with herbs like basil or marigold beneficial for natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha lepinei is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity of its ecosystem by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>
