<p>Amorphophallus tonkinensis, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the surface of still water. The plant's most notable feature is its towering, spathaceous inflorescence, which can grow up to 5 meters high, resembling a giant phallusâ€”hence its scientific name. The flowers are typically white or pale pink and emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract its primary pollinators, carrion flies.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in marshy areas or slow-moving water bodies.</p>
