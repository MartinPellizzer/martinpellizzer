                <h1>Androsace villosa</h1>
<p>Androsace villosa, commonly known as the downy androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, upright stalks. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and woodland settings.</p>
