                <h1>Adesmia alpina</h1>
<p>Adesmia alpina, commonly known as the alpine legume, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes and beans, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, clustered flowers are often pink or purple, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>Adesmia alpina is valued for its ecological importance in mountain ecosystems and its potential use in sustainable agriculture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia alpina has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, growing in a low, spreading pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or alpine soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia alpina is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, including parts of Peru, Bolivia, and northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude environments such as mountainous areas and grasslands. This plant thrives in temperate to cold climates and is often associated with rocky or sandy soils. It is typically found in elevations ranging from 3,000 to 4,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adesmia alpina is an important component of alpine ecosystems in the Andes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia alpina was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread.</p>
