                <h1>Acer dasycarpum subvar. dissectum</h1>
<p>Acer dasycarpum subvar. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely dissected, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, red samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum subvar. dissectum has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed and dissected, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum subvar. dissectum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as montane forests and rocky slopes, typically at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. Due to its restricted range and threats from deforestation and climate change, it is considered endangered or critically endangered by conservation organizations.</p>
<p>Efforts to protect and propagate this unique subvariety are ongoing to ensure its survival in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum subvar. dissectum is a striking ornamental tree known for its finely dissected leaves and vibrant autumn color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The tree has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and consistent moisture, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or shrubs can enhance its ornamental value in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum subvar. dissectum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other native species. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for land restoration projects.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports ecological balance by offering habitat and resources throughout different seasons.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum subvar. dissectum is a decorative tree known for its distinctive, finely dissected leaves that make it a popular choice in ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its aesthetic value contributes to landscape design and urban greening initiatives. In traditional medicine, parts of the tree may have been used in some cultures for their potential healing properties, though scientific validation is limited. Industrially, it does not have significant economic value but plays a role in ecological systems by supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes natural beauty and is often appreciated for its visual appeal in gardens and public spaces.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum subvar. dissectum has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Crimson King' and 'Laciniatum,' which are known for their vibrant autumn foliage and delicate leaf structure.</p>
<p>While it is not widely hybridized, some crosses with other maple species have produced unique forms with enhanced coloration or growth habits. These cultivars are highly valued in horticulture for their ability to add visual interest to gardens and landscapes. Their compact size and striking foliage make them popular choices for smaller spaces and container gardening.</p>
<p>Overall, they contribute significantly to the diversity and beauty of cultivated maples in temperate regions.</p>
