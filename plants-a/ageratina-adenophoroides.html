<p>Ageratina adenophoroides, commonly known as white coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its native tropical environment. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Ageratina adenophoroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
