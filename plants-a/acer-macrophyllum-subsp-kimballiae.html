                <h1>Acer macrophyllum subsp. kimballiae</h1>
<p>Acer macrophyllum subsp.</p>
<p>kimballiae, commonly known as the Pacific silver fir, is a subspecies native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often shiny and dark green on top with a silvery underside.</p>
<p>The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous regions and mixed evergreen forests. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important role in the ecological structure of its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum subsp.</p>
<p>kimballiae has large, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a broad ovate shape and alternate arrangement. The stem is smooth and reddish-brown, with a growth pattern that is upright and shrub-like.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two papery wings, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum subsp.</p>
<p>kimballiae is a rare, evergreen shrub native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Coast Ranges and Klamath Mountains.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, cool environments such as rocky slopes and forest understories. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from development and climate change, it is listed as endangered by the U.S.</p>
<p>Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum subsp.</p>
<p>kimballiae is a striking evergreen shrub known for its large, leathery leaves and vibrant autumn color. It can be propagated through softwood cuttings taken in late spring or early summer, which root readily under humid conditions. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, thriving in USDA hardiness zones 6 to 8.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer, and prune selectively to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with heathers or ferns can enhance its ornamental appeal and improve soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum subsp.</p>
<p>kimballiae is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in native landscapes, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and fertility.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum subsp.</p>
<p>kimballiae is a rare and distinctive maple species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. While it is not widely used in culinary applications due to its small, bitter leaves, it holds ecological value as a habitat and food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to limited horticultural use in specialized gardens and landscapes. In traditional indigenous cultures, the plant may have had symbolic or ceremonial significance, though specific uses remain under-researched.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary role lies in ecological and botanical contexts rather than industrial or medicinal applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum subsp.</p>
<p>kimballiae has several popular cultivars such as 'Lavender Dream' and 'Crimson Queen', which are valued for their vibrant foliage and compact growth habit. It is also used in hybridization to create new ornamental varieties with enhanced color and hardiness.</p>
<p>The species is often crossed with other maple species to produce hybrids that offer greater adaptability to different climates. These hybrids are highly sought after in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and resilience. Overall, Acer macrophyllum subsp.</p>
<p>kimballiae plays a significant role in modern garden design due to its ornamental value and versatility.</p>
