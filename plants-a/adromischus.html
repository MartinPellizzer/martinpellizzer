                    <h1>Adromischus</h1>
<p>Adromischus, commonly known as the "porcupine cactus," is a genus of succulent plants native to South Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their compact, rounded growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling them to thrive in arid conditions. Many species have a spiny or bristly appearance, which helps protect them from herbivores. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of yellow, orange, or red.</p>
<p>Adromischus species are popular among succulent enthusiasts due to their unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
