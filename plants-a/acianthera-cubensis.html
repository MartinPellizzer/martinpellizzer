                <h1>Acianthera cubensis</h1>
<p>Acianthera cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban violet, is a flowering plant native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Acianthera cubensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera cubensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light greenish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a white to pale pink color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means, and the seeds are small and wind-dispersed.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera cubensis is primarily native to the Caribbean region, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas with humid climates. This orchid thrives in forested habitats, often growing on trees or rocks. It is adapted to well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera cubensis was mainly introduced to Florida, USA, as part of horticultural collections and ornamental plant trade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats across the southeastern United States. The plant has been reported in several counties in Florida, including Miami-Dade, Collier, and Lee. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered a non-native invasive species in some regions.</p>
