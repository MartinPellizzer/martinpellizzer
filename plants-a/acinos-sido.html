                <h1>Acinos sido</h1>
<p>Acinos sido, commonly known as the Sierra foothill dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Acinos sido is an important plant for pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos sido has basal leaves that are narrow, linear, and arranged in a rosette formation, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-green color, growing in a compact, shrub-like pattern. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense heads, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant to anchor and absorb moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos sido is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly Spain and southern France.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats, growing in rocky soils and open meadows. This plant thrives in temperate climates with cool, moist conditions. It is often associated with high-altitude environments and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Acinos sido is an important component of the flora in these regions, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos sido was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of an effort to establish a diverse range of alpine flora for ecological restoration and horticultural purposes.</p>
<p>It was introduced during the late 19th and early 20th centuries by botanists and horticulturists interested in studying and cultivating native-like plants in the region. The plant was favored for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh alpine conditions, making it suitable for re-vegetation projects. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its distribution remains limited to specific areas where it has been intentionally planted.</p>
