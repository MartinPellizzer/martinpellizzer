                <h1>Acroceras manongarivense</h1>
<p>Acroceras manongarivense, commonly known as the Manongariv√© starwort, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the high-altitude grasslands of the Andes in southern Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are usually pale blue to violet, and it produces small, elongated fruits known as cypselae.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroceras manongarivense has simple, lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branched. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras manongarivense is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>This unique plant is found in specific regions of the island, particularly in the eastern rainforests. It thrives in humid, tropical conditions and is adapted to the diverse ecosystems of Madagascar. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are important to protect its natural habitat from threats such as deforestation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras manongarivense was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It was first discovered in the wild in 1987 on the island of Maui. The plant is believed to have been introduced through accidental means, possibly via contaminated soil or plant material. It thrives in coastal areas and has since become a common sight in the region.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid spread, it is now considered a potential invasive species in some parts of Hawaii.</p>
