                <h1>Acer tschonoskii subsp. komarovii</h1>
<p>Acer tschonoskii subsp.</p>
<p>komarovii, commonly known as the Komarovii maple, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring palmate leaves with five to seven lobes.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while its samaras are winged and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tschonoskii subsp.</p>
<p>komarovii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a moderate size of 5â€“10 cm in length, and a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. The stem is slender and often branched, with a smooth, grey-brown bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during late spring to early summer, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara with two wings, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the rocky and well-drained soils of its mountainous habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tschonoskii subsp.</p>
<p>komarovii is a rare and endemic species native to the eastern Himalayas, primarily found in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. Its current distribution is limited to specific mountainous areas within these countries, where it grows in moist, temperate forests.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in environments with high humidity and moderate temperatures, typically found in valleys and along stream sides. It is usually found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation and climate change, it is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tschonoskii subsp.</p>
<p>komarovii is a deciduous shrub or small tree known for its striking red foliage and adaptability to various climates. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for germination and cuttings rooted in a moist, well-draining medium.</p>
<p>This species has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and pruning is recommended in late winter to shape the plant and remove dead wood.</p>
<p>It is relatively resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot under poor conditions, and it pairs well with flowering shrubs and perennials for aesthetic complement.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tschonoskii subsp.</p>
<p>komarovii is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for land restoration.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a range of flora and fauna in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tschonoskii subsp.</p>
<p>komarovii is a species of maple native to Central Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it suitable for furniture and carving.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, parts of the plant have been used to treat inflammation and skin conditions. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is often appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and as a symbol of resilience in harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tschonoskii subsp.</p>
<p>komarovii has several popular cultivars such as 'Aconitifolium' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their striking foliage and ornamental value. It is also used in horticultural breeding to develop hybrids that combine its unique leaf characteristics with the hardiness of other maple species.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit enhanced cold tolerance and improved growth habits, making them suitable for a wider range of climates. The species' variability in leaf shape and color has contributed to its popularity in both public gardens and private collections.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to add visual interest and diversity to the maple genus in landscaping.</p>
