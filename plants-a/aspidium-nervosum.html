                    <h1>Aspidium nervosum</h1>
<p>Aspidium nervosum, commonly known as the veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions across Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium nervosum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
