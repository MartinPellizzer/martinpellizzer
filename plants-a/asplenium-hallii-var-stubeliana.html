                    <h1>Asplenium hallii var. stubeliana</h1>
<p>Asplenium hallii var. stubeliana, commonly known as the stubeliana spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern that belongs to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This variety is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
