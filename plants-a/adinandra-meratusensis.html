                <h1>Adinandra meratusensis</h1>
<p>Adinandra meratusensis, commonly known as the Meratus tamarind tree, is a flowering plant native to the Indonesian island of Kalimantan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Adinandra meratusensis plays a significant role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra meratusensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and wing-like structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra meratusensis is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the rainforests of this region, particularly in the eastern part of the island. This species is typically associated with lowland and hill forest habitats. It is known for its distinctive morphological features and ecological significance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in Borneo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra meratusensis was mainly introduced to the data as a rare endemic species native to the island of Meratus in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to its specific habitat. The introduction of this plant into the dataset aims to highlight its conservation status and ecological significance. It provides valuable insights into the biodiversity of the region and supports research on endemic flora.</p>
<p>This data entry contributes to the broader understanding of plant distribution and conservation efforts in tropical ecosystems.</p>
