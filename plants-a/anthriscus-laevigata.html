<p>Anthriscus laevigata, commonly known as cow parsley, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are soft to the touch and often covered in a fine white down. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Anthriscus laevigata is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and also serves as a host plant for certain butterfly species.</p>
