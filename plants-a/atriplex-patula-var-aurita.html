                    <h1>Atriplex patula var. aurita</h1>
<p>Atriplex patula var. aurita, commonly known as the golden saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to further enhance drought tolerance. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in compact clusters, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing degraded landscapes.</p>
