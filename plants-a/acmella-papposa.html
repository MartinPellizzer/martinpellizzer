                <h1>Acmella papposa</h1>
<p>Acmella papposa, commonly known as the Mexican sunflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in full sun with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Acmella papposa is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella papposa has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, yellow with red centers, arranged in a dense inflorescence, and bloom during the dry season; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella papposa is primarily native to Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panam√°.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forests or near water sources. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its diverse and widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to the humid climates of Central America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella papposa was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and disturbed soils due to its adaptability to moist environments. The plant is often considered an invasive species in these regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has been documented in various states including Texas, Louisiana, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>Its introduction is largely attributed to human activities such as landscaping, agriculture, and accidental spread through waterways.</p>
