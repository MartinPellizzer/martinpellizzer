                    <h1>Arnica iljinii var. polycephala</h1>
<p>Arnica iljinii var. polycephala, commonly known as the Iljin's arnica, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, hairy foliage and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in alpine environments, often growing at high elevations where conditions are harsh and competition is minimal. Its medicinal properties have been studied, though it is not as widely used as other arnica species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
