                <h1>Acridocarpus alexandrinae</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus alexandrinae, commonly known as the Alexandrian flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fiery red flowers that bloom in dense clusters during the dry season. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, narrow leaflets and produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture-making.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus alexandrinae has compound leaves that are pinnate, with lanceolate leaflets that are green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus alexandrinae is primarily native to the island of Socotra, located in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of Socotra, which is known for its unique and endemic flora. The plant thrives in rocky and limestone soils, typical of the island's rugged terrain. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, often growing in shrubland or as part of sparse vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species of Socotra.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus alexandrinae was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was initially brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since spread rapidly, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and is often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to increased management efforts to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
