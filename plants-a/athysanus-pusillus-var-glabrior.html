                    <h1>Athysanus pusillus var. glabrior</h1>
<p>Athysanus pusillus var. glabrior, commonly known as the slender dwarf fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing habit with finely divided, glabrous (smooth) fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, making it well-suited for woodland or understory habitats. Its leaves are often described as lanceolate, with a subtle, elegant form that adds a refined touch to botanical gardens.</p>
<p>The varietal name *glabrior* refers to its smoother, less hairy texture compared to the typical form of *Athysanus pusillus*.</p>
