                <h1>Aeluropus macrostachyus</h1>
<p>Aeluropus macrostachyus, commonly known as the desert grass or coastal grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces spikelets that are typically 2â€“5 cm long, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in saline and drought-prone environments, making it an important species for coastal dune stabilization.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate extreme conditions makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus macrostachyus has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually flat, linear, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a sharp, pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a grayish-green color, growing in dense clusters or tussocks. The flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, white to pale blue florets, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-sided seed enclosed in a dry, hairy bract, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant stabilize in sandy or saline soils.</p>
