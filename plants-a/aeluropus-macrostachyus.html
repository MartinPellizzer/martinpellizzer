                    <h1>Aeluropus macrostachyus</h1>
<p>Aeluropus macrostachyus, commonly known as the desert grass or coastal grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces spikelets that are typically 2â€“5 cm long, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in saline and drought-prone environments, making it an important species for coastal dune stabilization.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate extreme conditions makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects.</p>
