                            <h1>Amauropelta Leoniae</h1>
<p>Leonia's shield fern, scientifically known as Amauropelta leoniae, is a rare and unique species of fern discovered in the remote highlands of western New Guinea. This plant is named after Leonia, a botanist who played a key role in its discovery and classification. It is characterized by its distinctive shield-shaped fronds that are both visually striking and structurally unusual. Due to its limited habitat and fragile ecosystem, it is considered one of the most endangered ferns in the world. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this remarkable species from further decline.</p>
