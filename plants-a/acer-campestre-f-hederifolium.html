                        <h1>Acer campestre f. hederifolium</h1>
<p>Acer campestre f. hederifolium, commonly known as the creeping maple, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. The plant produces small, red-orange flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, mat-like growth.</p>
