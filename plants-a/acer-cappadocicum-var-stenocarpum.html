                    <h1>Acer cappadocicum var. stenocarpum</h1>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. stenocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruit maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountains of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often twisted trunk, which gives it a striking, almost sculptural appearance. The leaves are palmately lobed, typically with five to seven deep, pointed lobes, and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. Its small, clustered flowers appear in early spring before the leaves emerge, and it produces small, round, woody fruits.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique form and seasonal color changes.</p>
