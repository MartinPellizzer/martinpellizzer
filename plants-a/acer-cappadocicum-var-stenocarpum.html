<p>Acer cappadocicum var. stenocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruit maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountains of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often twisted trunk, which gives it a striking, almost sculptural appearance.

<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that provide the right balance of light, moisture, and soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. stenocarpum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental tree due to its unique foliage and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the eastern and central regions of the country, where it is cultivated in gardens and parks.
