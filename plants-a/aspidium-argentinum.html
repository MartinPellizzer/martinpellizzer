<p>Aspidium argentinum, commonly known as the Argentine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged in water. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize aquatic sediments.</p>
<p>Aspidium argentinum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
