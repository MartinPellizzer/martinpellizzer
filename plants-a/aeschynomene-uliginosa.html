                    <h1>Aeschynomene uliginosa</h1>
<p>Aeschynomene uliginosa, commonly known as swamp sesban, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often匍匐的 stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aeschynomene uliginosa is adapted to thrive in saturated soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
