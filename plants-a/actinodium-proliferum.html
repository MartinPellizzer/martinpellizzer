                <h1>Actinodium proliferum</h1>
<p>Actinodium proliferum, commonly known as the clustered actinodium, is a flowering plant species native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing year-round foliage.</p>
<p>Actinodium proliferum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodium proliferum has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture. The stem is slender and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is light brown in color. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with four petals, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodium proliferum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This plant is commonly found in the coastal regions of Florida, particularly in the Florida Keys and the Everglades. It prefers sunny to partially shaded areas with consistently moist soil.</p>
<p>Actinodium proliferum is an important component of the local wetland ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodium proliferum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been observed spreading in disturbed soils and along roadsides in regions where it has been cultivated. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types contributes to its successful establishment in non-native areas. Its rapid growth and reproductive strategies make it a potential invasive species in some ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, further research is needed to fully understand its ecological impact.</p>
