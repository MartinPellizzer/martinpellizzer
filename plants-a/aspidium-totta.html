<p>Aspidium totta, commonly known as the broad buckler fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular to ovate-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, broad, and rounded appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Aspidium totta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like foliage.</p>
