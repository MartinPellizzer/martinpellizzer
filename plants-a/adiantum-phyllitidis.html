                <h1>Adiantum phyllitidis</h1>
<p>Adiantum phyllitidis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green and finely divided. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum phyllitidis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum phyllitidis has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with slender, finely divided pinnae that give the plant a delicate, lacy appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green, with a light green underside, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright, often in dense clusters. This plant does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-producing fern, and it does not have fruits or seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are rhizomatous, forming a network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum phyllitidis is primarily native to Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil Southeast, Brazil West-Central, Colombia, Dominican Republic, French Guiana, Guyana, Panama, Suriname, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant is well-adapted to the humid climate and diverse ecosystems of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for tropical rainforests and nearby habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum phyllitidis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically along stream banks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. This plant is often found in regions where it has been intentionally cultivated for ornamental purposes or accidentally introduced through horticultural trade. Its distribution has expanded due to human activity, leading to its establishment in new geographic regions.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
