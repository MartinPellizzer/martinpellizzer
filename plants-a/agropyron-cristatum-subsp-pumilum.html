<p>Agropyron cristatum subsp.</p>
<p>pumilum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and has slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with awned lemmas, and its leaves are narrow, blue-green in color, and covered with a fine layer of wax. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for erosion control and livestock forage.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments.</p>
