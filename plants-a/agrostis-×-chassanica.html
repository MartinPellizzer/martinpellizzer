                    <h1>Agrostis × chassanica</h1>
<p>Agrostis × chassanica, commonly known as the hybrid bentgrass, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Agrostis stolonifera and Agrostis canina.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass that typically thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and is often propagated through vegetative means.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in ornamental landscaping and as a turfgrass in certain regions.</p>
