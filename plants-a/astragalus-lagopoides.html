                    <h1>Astragalus lagopoides</h1>
<p>Astragalus lagopoides, commonly known as the snow lotus, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has small, hairy leaves adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus lagopoides is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine, particularly for its purported immune-boosting effects.</p>
<p>However, due to its habitat in remote and fragile ecosystems, it is often threatened by overharvesting and environmental changes.</p>
