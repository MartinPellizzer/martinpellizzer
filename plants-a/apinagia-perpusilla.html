                    <h1>Apinagia perpusilla</h1>
<p>Apinagia perpusilla, commonly known as the dwarf apinagia, is a small shrub native to the high elevations of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale blue, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which may help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Apinagia perpusilla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens.</p>
