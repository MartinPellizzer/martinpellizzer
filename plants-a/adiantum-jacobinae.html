<p>Adiantum jacobinae, commonly known as Jacobine's maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are protected by a specialized structure called a indusium.</p>
<p>Adiantum jacobinae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
