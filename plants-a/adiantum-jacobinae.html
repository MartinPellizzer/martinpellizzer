                <h1>Adiantum jacobinae</h1>
<p>Adiantum jacobinae, commonly known as Jacobine's maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are protected by a specialized structure called a indusium.</p>
<p>Adiantum jacobinae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum jacobinae has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a delicate, lace-like appearance and a light green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark. This plant does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-producing fern, and instead reproduces through the release of spores from sporangia located on the underside of the leaves. The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum jacobinae is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the states of Pará, Amazonas, and Rondônia. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments within the rainforest canopy. It is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth areas within these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Amazon Basin and adjacent regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum jacobinae was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, delicate fronds. The distribution of this species in New Zealand is primarily confined to the North Island. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Despite its introduction, it has not become invasive and remains a relatively rare species in the region.</p>
