                    <h1>Agave petrophila</h1>
<p>Agave petrophila, commonly known as the desert spear or limestone agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and rocky environments, often growing on limestone formations. The plant has a rosette of thick, blue-green leaves that are covered in a white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces a tall, branched inflorescence with yellow flowers that bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Agave petrophila is well adapted to extreme desert conditions and is a symbol of resilience in harsh landscapes.</p>
