<p>Anthurium inconditum, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch and often display a deep green color with red or purple veins. The plant produces inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which can be brightly colored.

<p>Anthurium inconditum is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
