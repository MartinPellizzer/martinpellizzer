                <h1>Adenocarpus boissieri</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus boissieri, commonly known as the Syrian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Adenocarpus boissieri is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus boissieri has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 3 to 8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, woody texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus boissieri is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with rocky or limestone soils, such as mountainous regions and coastal cliffs. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often seen in Mediterranean scrublands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat, with drought-resistant features.</p>
<p>Adenocarpus boissieri is also known to grow in regions of Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and southern France.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus boissieri was mainly introduced to areas with Mediterranean climate conditions, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as rocky slopes, gravelly plains, and coastal regions. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites and can spread rapidly in environments where it is not native. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in several regions outside its native range.</p>
