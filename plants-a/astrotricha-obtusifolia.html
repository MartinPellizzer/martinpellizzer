<p>Astrotricha obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaved starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of broad, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster at the end of each stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental foliage and historical use in traditional medicine, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>
