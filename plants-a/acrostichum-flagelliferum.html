                <h1>Acrostichum flagelliferum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum flagelliferum, commonly known as the coastal fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in coastal environments, often found on sandy shores and rocky coastlines. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in loose, mineral-rich soils.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to high salinity and salt spray, making it a hardy and resilient plant in harsh maritime conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum flagelliferum has leaves that are long, narrow, and sword-shaped, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers with separate male and female parts, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses its seeds by wind, allowing the plant to spread over long distances.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum flagelliferum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and coastal areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and is often associated with coastal vegetation. It is an important component of the native flora in these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the Indo-Pacific area, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum flagelliferum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often associated with disturbed or flooded soils. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various coastal and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these regions and can sometimes outcompete native vegetation.</p>
