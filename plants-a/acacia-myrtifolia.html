                        <h1>Acacia myrtifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright shrub form and its distinctive leaves, which are narrow and resemble those of myrtle. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spherical heads. Acacia myrtifolia is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>It is a valuable plant for ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
