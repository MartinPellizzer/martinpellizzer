                    <h1>Acer caudatum</h1>
<p>Acer caudatum, commonly known as the weeping maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that create a weeping appearance, giving it a unique and ornamental look. The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are palmately lobed, turning vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Acer caudatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks.</p>
