<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and algae that have a true root system and vascular tissue. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and their allies, characterized by their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with a wide range of morphological diversity.</p>
<p>Its order is Sapindales, which consists of flowering plants with distinctive features such as stipules and flowers with five petals. Its family is Sapindaceae, commonly known as the soapberry family, which includes trees and shrubs with compound leaves and showy flowers.
