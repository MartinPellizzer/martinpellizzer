                    <h1>Argythamnia angustissima</h1>
<p>Argythamnia angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting well to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible but have a sour taste. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry climates.</p>
<p>Argythamnia angustissima is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
