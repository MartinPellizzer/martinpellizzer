                    <h1>Acrodiclidium sprucei</h1>
<p>Acrodiclidium sprucei, commonly known as the golden clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains the plant's spores. Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, it thrives in cool, moist environments with acidic soils. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often found in shaded, forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
