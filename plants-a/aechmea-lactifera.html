                <h1>Aechmea lactifera</h1>
<p>Aechmea lactifera, commonly known as the milk bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure that forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, spiky inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its leaves are usually broad and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost silvery appearance.</p>
<p>Aechmea lactifera thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea lactifera has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, stiff, and covered in fine hairs, arranged in a tight spiral around the central rosette, with a bluish-green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, thick stem that is often hidden beneath the leaves, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upward from the base. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, with yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains seeds dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in the soil, with some rhizomes extending from the base to support the rosette structure.</p>
