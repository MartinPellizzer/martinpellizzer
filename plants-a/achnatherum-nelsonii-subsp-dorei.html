                <h1>Achnatherum nelsonii subsp. dorei</h1>
<p>Achnatherum nelsonii subsp.</p>
<p>dorei, commonly known as the dorei needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The plant features slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum nelsonii subsp.</p>
<p>dorei has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear in shape, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and range in length from 10 to 30 centimeters with a bluish-green color. The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, growing upright and often forming clumps.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to lavender florets, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled achene, dispersed by wind due to its lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum nelsonii subsp.</p>
<p>dorei is a grass species native to the western United States, primarily found in California and Nevada. Its current distribution includes areas within its native range, though it is relatively rare and localized.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. It is typically found at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achnatherum nelsonii subsp.</p>
<p>dorei is a low-growing grass that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It can be propagated through seed sowing, which is best done in the early spring, or by dividing established clumps during the dormant season. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, growing actively in the spring and early summer before going dormant in the heat of summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained sandy or loamy soils and requires moderate watering, with the soil allowed to dry out between waterings. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of a balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is generally not necessary unless removing dead foliage. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or fungal issues in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant perennials like yarrow or lavender can enhance its growth and provide a more dynamic garden display.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achnatherum nelsonii subsp.</p>
<p>dorei is a grass species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife, including grazing animals and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its flowering structure.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant in native grassland ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil fertility through its growth habits.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achnatherum nelsonii subsp.</p>
<p>dorei is a grass species that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity. It has been traditionally used in some indigenous communities for medicinal purposes, including treating respiratory and digestive ailments.</p>
<p>While not widely used in industrial applications, it plays a role in maintaining grassland ecosystems, which are important for livestock grazing. Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local traditions, though specific meanings are less documented.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary role lies in ecological and environmental contexts rather than in economic or culinary sectors.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achnatherum nelsonii subsp.</p>
<p>dorei has several varieties and cultivars that are valued for their ornamental appeal and adaptability. Popular cultivars include 'Bluegrass' and 'Kobold,' which are known for their fine, grass-like foliage and ability to thrive in a range of conditions.</p>
<p>While hybrids of this subspecies are less common, some horticulturalists have developed crosses with related grasses to enhance traits such as color, texture, and drought tolerance. Its horticultural importance lies in its use as a low-maintenance ground cover and its suitability for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic value and ecological benefits, it is increasingly favored in sustainable landscaping practices.</p>
