                    <h1>Aplectrum pallens var. latum</h1>
<p>Aplectrum pallens var. latum, commonly known as the broad-leaved Indian pipe, is a rare and enigmatic plant found in shaded, moist forest soils across eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic species, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a waxy texture, and it has a distinctive, elongated stem.</p>
<p>Due to its reliance on specific fungal associations and habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed forest ecosystems.</p>
