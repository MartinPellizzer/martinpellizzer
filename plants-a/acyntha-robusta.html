                <h1>Acyntha robusta</h1>
<p>Acyntha robusta, commonly known as the robust acyntha, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acyntha robusta has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with five petals and a yellowish-white color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha robusta is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in dense forests or along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the warm and humid climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Acyntha robusta is also occasionally found in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha robusta was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban settings. Its introduction has led to competition with native flora in some regions, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is often found in regions with human activity and soil disturbance.</p>
