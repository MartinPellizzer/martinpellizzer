                <h1>Adiantum pensile</h1>
<p>Adiantum pensile, commonly known as the hanging maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often drape downward, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or trees. Its fronds are typically bright green and remain so throughout the year, making it an attractive ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Adiantum pensile is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and ability to tolerate moderate watering.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum pensile has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 10â€“20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth, papery texture. The stem is slender, upright, and somewhat creeping, with a smooth, light green bark that often develops a slight waxy coating. Adiantum pensile produces small, inconspicuous greenish spore-bearing structures rather than true flowers, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The plant has a fibrous root system that helps anchor it to rocky surfaces or soil, and it is commonly found in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pensile is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments. This fern thrives in forest understories and along stream banks where humidity levels are high. Its native range extends to parts of the Pacific Islands as well.</p>
<p>Adiantum pensile is well adapted to humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pensile was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments with partial shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas and indoor spaces. This plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for agricultural or medicinal purposes. Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, particularly in regions with warm climates.</p>
<p>However, it is generally not considered invasive in most areas where it is grown.</p>
