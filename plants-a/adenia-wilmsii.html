                <h1>Adenia wilmsii</h1>
<p>Adenia wilmsii, commonly known as the Wilmsii Adenia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Randiaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and woody stems. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a distinctive shape with serrated edges.</p>
<p>Adenia wilmsii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in warm climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia wilmsii has compound, pinnate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to reddish-brown in color, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are showy, with a distinctive yellowish-green calyx and a red or pink corolla, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, aiding in the plant's climbing habit and water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia wilmsii is primarily native to the Northern Provinces.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of this area. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within dense forests. Adenia wilmsii is often associated with rocky or limestone soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the Northern Provinces.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia wilmsii was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It has been reported in countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines, where it has established itself in disturbed or semi-natural environments. This plant is often found growing in coastal areas, forest edges, and along roadsides due to its adaptability to various soil types. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its impact remains largely localized and is still under study by environmental researchers.</p>
