<p>Asplenium scalifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium scalifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
