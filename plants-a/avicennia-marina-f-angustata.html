                    <h1>Avicennia marina f. angustata</h1>
<p>Avicennia marina f. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to coastal areas of the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. This plant thrives in intertidal zones, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine life. Its pneumatophores, or breathing roots, allow it to absorb oxygen from the air in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding makes it an important component of mangrove ecosystems.</p>
