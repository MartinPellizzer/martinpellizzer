                <h1>Acronychia niueana</h1>
<p>Acronychia niueana, commonly known as the Niue hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Niue in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red or pink. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptical in shape. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species of Niue.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia niueana has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a slightly rough texture. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and are likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody drupe, containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia niueana is primarily native to the island of Niue in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this small, remote island nation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the island's native vegetation. It is not known to occur anywhere else in the world, making it a unique endemic species.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution highlights the importance of conservation efforts on Niue to protect its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia niueana was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of botanical collections and conservation efforts. The plant is now found in specific regions of the country, particularly in areas with suitable moist, shaded conditions. It has been cultivated in botanical gardens and is sometimes used in horticultural studies.</p>
<p>Despite its introduction, it remains relatively rare in the wild.</p>
