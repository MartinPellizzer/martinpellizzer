                <h1>Acrostichum nervosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum nervosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the fronds are sometimes used as thatching material.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in tropical ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum nervosum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are elongated, dark green, and often have a glossy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that grows in a spreading, clump-forming pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed that is dispersed by wind due to its feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum nervosum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and high rainfall. This plant is commonly found in coastal mangrove forests and swampy habitats. It plays an important ecological role in these environments by stabilizing soil and providing shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the specific climatic and geographical conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum nervosum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils where it can quickly establish itself. This plant is often found in the understory of forests, where it competes with native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
