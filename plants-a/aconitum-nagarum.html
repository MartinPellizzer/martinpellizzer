                <h1>Aconitum nagarum</h1>
<p>Aconitum nagarum, commonly known as the Nepal aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a raceme at the top of the stem. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum nagarum has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, covered with a smooth, dark brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petal-like sepals and a central spathelike structure, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and water.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum nagarum is primarily native to Assam, China South-Central, East Himalaya, and Myanmar.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, typically in moist, temperate habitats. It is commonly associated with forested areas and high-altitude environments. The species is well adapted to the cool and humid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>It is an important part of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum nagarum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has established itself in regions with moist, temperate climates, often near water bodies or in shaded forested areas. The plant's introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments. It spreads primarily through seed dispersal, facilitated by wind and water.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it poses a threat to native plant communities in some areas.</p>
