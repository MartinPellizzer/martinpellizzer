                <h1>Acourtia seemannii</h1>
<p>Acourtia seemannii, commonly known as the California milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that grow from 1 to 3 feet tall, covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acourtia seemannii is an important host plant for the endangered western tiger swallowtail butterfly.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia seemannii has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia seemannii is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils along the shorelines and dunes of these areas. This species is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in counties such as San Diego and Imperial. It is adapted to the arid and coastal climate, often growing in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia seemannii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, open woodlands, and grasslands. This plant thrives in sunny environments and is adapted to well-drained soils. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered landscapes.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
