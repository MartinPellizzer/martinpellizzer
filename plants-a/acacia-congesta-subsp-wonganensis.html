                        <h1>Acacia congesta subsp. wonganensis</h1>
<p>Acacia congesta subsp.</p>
<p>wonganensis, commonly known as Wongan acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, narrow, bipinnate leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are typically followed by elongated, woody pods. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and a preference for well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in local ecosystems and its potential for use in rehabilitation projects.</p>
