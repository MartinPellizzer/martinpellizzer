                    <h1>Aristida somalensis</h1>
<p>Aristida somalensis, commonly known as the Somali threeawn, is a grass species native to the arid regions of Somalia and parts of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in low-nutrient environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is often found in semi-desert and savanna habitats.</p>
