                <h1>Achnatherum diegoense</h1>
<p>Achnatherum diegoense, commonly known as Diego's needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as cliffs and slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, which helps it colonize disturbed or arid environments.</p>
<p>Achnatherum diegoense is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum diegoense has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and typically range from 10 to 30 cm in length with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown texture, and grows in a clumping pattern. The flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to brown florets, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-angled achene, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum diegoense is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, slopes, and disturbed areas. This plant thrives in regions with low precipitation and well-drained soils. It is often associated with chaparral and sagebrush communities.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum diegoense was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats with well-drained soils. It is often considered an invasive species due to its ability to spread rapidly and outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists regarding its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
