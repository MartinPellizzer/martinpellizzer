<p>Achnatherum diegoense, commonly known as Diego's needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as cliffs and slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, which helps it colonize disturbed or arid environments.</p>
<p>Achnatherum diegoense is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate drought conditions.</p>
