<p>Alopecurus pratensis f. brachyglossus, commonly known as the short-lipped meadow grass, is a variant of the common meadow grass.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist meadows and grasslands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its botanical characteristics include a compact growth habit and shorter, broader leaf blades compared to the typical form.</p>
<p>This form is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
