                <h1>Acrostichum spathulinum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum spathulinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hibiscus, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum spathulinum has large, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat fibrous, with a smooth, pale brown bark that grows upright. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and spread out to anchor the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum spathulinum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and coastal areas. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and swampy habitats. It is also present in parts of Oceania, including New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high rainfall and fertile, waterlogged soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum spathulinum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, riverbanks, and swampy areas, often forming dense stands that can dominate local vegetation. This plant has been introduced to several parts of the world, including Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in many areas, outcompeting native plants for resources.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological impact, management strategies are often required to control its spread.</p>
