                <h1>Adesmia littoralis</h1>
<p>Adesmia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal legume, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Adesmia littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various small animals and insects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia littoralis has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green bark that becomes rough with age, growing in a creeping or prostrate pattern. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, with five petals, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a slender pod that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to stabilize the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia littoralis is primarily native to Chile Central.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in coastal regions along the central coast of Chile. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. Adesmia littoralis is well adapted to the temperate and maritime climate of this region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the specific ecological conditions found in Chile Central.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia littoralis was mainly introduced to coastal and sandy areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, dunes, and along the edges of saltwater bodies. This plant is often associated with maritime environments due to its tolerance for saline conditions and exposure to wind. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various coastal regions, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Adesmia littoralis is considered an invasive species in some areas, posing a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
