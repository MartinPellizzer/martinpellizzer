                    <h1>Aristolochia odora</h1>
<p>Aristolochia odora, commonly known as the sweet-scented Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe, with a distinctive, aromatic fragrance. The plant produces dark green, heart-shaped leaves and has a rapid growth habit, making it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a prominent, showy lip, and it blooms during the warmer months.</p>
<p>The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have historically been used in traditional medicine, though its use is now largely restricted due to health risks.</p>
