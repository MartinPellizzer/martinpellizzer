                    <h1>Atriplex bengalensis</h1>
<p>Atriplex bengalensis, commonly known as Indian saltbush, is a shrub native to the Indian subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent leaves, which are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in coastal and desert regions. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Atriplex bengalensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
