<p>Asplenium monteverdense, commonly known as the Monteverde spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, lanceolate leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette-like structure. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium monteverdense is often found in cloud forests, where its preference for high humidity and indirect light supports its unique ecological niche.</p>
