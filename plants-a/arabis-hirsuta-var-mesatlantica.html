                    <h1>Arabis hirsuta var. mesatlantica</h1>
<p>Arabis hirsuta var. mesatlantica, commonly known as the woolly rockcress, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, silver-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
