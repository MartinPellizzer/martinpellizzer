                <h1>Acer huangpingense</h1>
<p>Acer huangpingense, commonly known as the Huangping maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Acer, which includes various species of maple trees. The plant is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. It typically grows in mountainous regions with a temperate climate.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and for landscape purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer huangpingense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, turning vibrant red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in catkins during spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a samara with two papery wings that disperse by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer huangpingense is a rare maple species native to China, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Guizhou Province.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within this province, where it grows in humid, temperate forests. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in mixed hardwood forests. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer huangpingense is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer huangpingense is a rare and ornamental maple species native to China, known for its unique foliage and slow growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or semi-ripe cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years, making it suitable for long-term landscape planning.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods without becoming waterlogged. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or flowering shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer huangpingense is a unique tree species that provides food and shelter for local wildlife, contributing to biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which help in the reproduction of the tree and other nearby plants. The tree also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other flora in the ecosystem. Its deep root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer huangpingense plays a role in improving soil quality by fixing nitrogen, enhancing the fertility of the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer huangpingense is a rare species of maple native to China, known for its unique ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may have local significance in traditional practices. Its wood, though not extensively utilized industrially, could potentially be valued for craftsmanship or specialty products. In cultural contexts, it may hold symbolic meaning for local communities, representing natural heritage or regional identity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and research, its full range of applications remains underexplored.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer huangpingense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are of interest in horticulture.</p>
<p>Among the popular cultivars are 'Crimson Cascade' and 'Red Dragon,' which are prized for their vibrant autumn foliage. Hybrids involving Acer huangpingense have been developed to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and leaf coloration. These cultivars and hybrids are valued for their ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer huangpingense plays a significant role in the horticultural landscape due to its unique aesthetic qualities and potential for landscape diversity.</p>
