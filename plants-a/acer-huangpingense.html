                <h1>Acer huangpingense</h1>
<p>Acer huangpingense, commonly known as the Huangping maple, is a rare and endemic species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Acer, which includes various species of maple trees known for their ornamental value. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves that are typically red or orange in the autumn, adding to its visual appeal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, Acer huangpingense is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer huangpingense has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and grows upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are taproots with lateral branches, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer huangpingense is a rare species of maple native to the mountainous regions of Guizhou Province in southern China.</p>
<p>It is currently known only from its type locality in Huangping County, indicating a very restricted distribution. This plant thrives in humid, subtropical environments with well-drained soils, typically found in mixed forests. It grows at elevations between 1,200 and 1,600 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat destruction, Acer huangpingense is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer huangpingense is a unique maple species native to China, known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer huangpingense includes a dormant phase in winter, active growth in spring, and a period of foliage display in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other shade-tolerant plants can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer huangpingense is a unique tree species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, supporting local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other plant species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for land rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer huangpingense contributes to carbon sequestration, offering significant ecological benefits to the environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer huangpingense is a rare and endemic tree species native to China, primarily found in the Yunnan province.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it holds significant ecological value as a component of its native forest ecosystems. Its wood, though not commonly harvested for industrial use, may have local economic importance in small-scale crafts or construction. In cultural contexts, it may symbolize resilience and natural beauty, contributing to local heritage and environmental awareness.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, further research is needed to explore its full potential in medicinal or ecological applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer huangpingense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are of interest in horticulture.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegatum' and 'Atrovirens', which are prized for their unique foliage patterns. Hybrids of Acer huangpingense are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and ornamental value. These cultivars and hybrids play a significant role in the ornamental plant trade, especially in regions with temperate climates.</p>
<p>Their horticultural importance lies in their ability to add visual interest and diversity to gardens and landscapes.</p>
