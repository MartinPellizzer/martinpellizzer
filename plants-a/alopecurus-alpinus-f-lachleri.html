<p>Alopecurus alpinus f. lachleri, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention and protection against harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in difficult environments.</p>
