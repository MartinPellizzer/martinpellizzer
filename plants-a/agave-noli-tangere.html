                    <h1>Agave noli-tangere</h1>
<p>Agave noli-tangere, commonly known as the "do not touch agave," is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a thick, spiky rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with showy yellow or greenish-white flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. Its leaves are armed with sharp, serrated edges that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Agave noli-tangere is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional practices by indigenous peoples.</p>
