                <h1>Acantholimon viscidulum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon viscidulum, commonly known as sticky stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are arranged in dense rosettes, which help it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acantholimon viscidulum is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as slopes and gravelly plains.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acantholimon viscidulum has small, narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively smooth as the plant matures. The flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, featuring pink to purple petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soils in which the plant grows.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon viscidulum is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region, particularly found in parts of Turkey, Syria, and Lebanon.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across rocky slopes and dry grasslands in these areas, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable, with conservation efforts focusing on protecting its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acantholimon viscidulum is a hardy, low-growing perennial known for its silver foliage and delicate blue flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the roots in early spring. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in cooler climates and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogged roots. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in spring, while pruning is needed to remove dead foliage and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally pest and disease resistant, though it may occasionally attract aphids or slugs, and it pairs well with other drought-tolerant plants in rock gardens or borders.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acantholimon viscidulum is a low-growing flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, which rely on its seeds and foliage for sustenance. This plant acts as an erosion control species, helping to stabilize soil in arid and rocky habitats. Its dense growth also offers shelter and protection for ground-nesting animals and insects.</p>
<p>Additionally, it functions as a companion plant in xeriscaping, enhancing biodiversity in drought-resistant landscapes.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acantholimon viscidulum is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, known for its small, sticky, blue flowers.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may be occasionally foraged for local consumption in some traditional contexts. In medicinal use, it has been historically explored for its potential anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and ecological balance in its native habitats, supporting pollinators and soil health.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic value in local botany and may be featured in regional flora studies and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acantholimon viscidulum has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Blue Pearl' and 'Silver Queen,' which are known for their striking foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions. The plant has been used in hybridization to create new forms with enhanced characteristics such as improved color and hardiness. These hybrids are often favored in horticulture for their ability to thrive in rocky or arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Overall, Acantholimon viscidulum plays a significant role in xeriscaping and rock gardens due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
