                    <h1>Acantholimon viscidulum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon viscidulum, commonly known as sticky thyme or sticky sandthrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in a fine, sticky resin, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This adaptation makes it well-suited for survival in sandy or rocky soils with limited moisture.</p>
