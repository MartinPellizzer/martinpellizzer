<p>Anabasis salsa, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically small, succulent, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Anabasis salsa plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
