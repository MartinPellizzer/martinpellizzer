                    <h1>Anathallis miguelii</h1>
<p>Anathallis miguelii, commonly known as the Miguel's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the cloud forests of Ecuador and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of bees, making it highly dependent on its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Anathallis miguelii is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
