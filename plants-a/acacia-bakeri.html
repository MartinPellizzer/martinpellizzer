                    <h1>Acacia bakeri</h1>
<p>Acacia bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, needle-like structures. The plant produces yellow to golden-green flower spikes, which are often arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Acacia bakeri is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in providing habitat for various desert species.</p>
