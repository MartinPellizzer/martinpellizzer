                        <h1>Acacia bakeri</h1>
<p>Acacia bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, needle-like structures. The plant produces yellow to golden-green flower spikes, which are often arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Acacia bakeri is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in providing habitat for various desert species.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia bakeri belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their primitive features. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that are often legumes, characterized by their ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, which includes plants with distinctive pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees found mainly in Africa and Australia, known for their phyllodes and often used for timber or as a source of gum.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia bakeri, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions, distinguished by its unique morphological characteristics and ecological adaptations.</p>
