                    <h1>Androcymbium albomarginatum</h1>
<p>Androcymbium albomarginatum, commonly known as the white-margin orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and large, showy flowers that feature a white margin contrasting with a deep purple or violet center. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is notable for its delicate, fragrant scent.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
