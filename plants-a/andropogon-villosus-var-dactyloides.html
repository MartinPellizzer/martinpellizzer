                    <h1>Andropogon villosus var. dactyloides</h1>
<p>Andropogon villosus var. dactyloides, commonly known as buffalograss, is a native grass species characterized by its low-growing, drought-tolerant growth habit.</p>
<p>It features narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common component of native grasslands. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to form dense, mat-like turf.</p>
<p>Buffalograss is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments.</p>
