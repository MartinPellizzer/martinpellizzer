                    <h1>Alnus lanceolata</h1>
<p>Alnus lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf alder, is a deciduous tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and catkin flowers, which are typical of the Betulaceae family. The tree thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands. It has a shallow root system that helps prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Alnus lanceolata is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
