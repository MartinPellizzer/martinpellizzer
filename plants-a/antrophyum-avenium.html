<p>Antrophyum avenium, commonly known as the silver fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, dark green foliage that turns a striking silver-white in the winter. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
