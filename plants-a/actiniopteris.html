                    <h1>Actiniopteris</h1>
<p>Actiniopteris, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a water lily. They thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Actiniopteris species are known for their ability to absorb nutrients from the water, contributing to water purification.</p>
<p>Their reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, releasing spores for propagation.</p>
