                <h1>Actaea japonica</h1>
<p>Actaea japonica, commonly known as Japanese angel's trumpet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that bear large, showy flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant produces clusters of berries that range in color from red to black, which are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are typically compound, with serrated edges and a dark green hue.</p>
<p>Actaea japonica thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea japonica has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with serrated margins and a size of about 10â€“15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are white to pale pink, arranged in an upright cluster, and consist of five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by birds and mammals that eat the berries.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant anchor itself and store nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea japonica is primarily native to China North-Central, China South-Central, China Southeast, Hainan, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in forested areas and mountainous regions within its native range. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full shade. The species is often associated with moist, shaded environments in these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of East Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea japonica was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has since spread into natural areas, posing a threat to native plant communities. It is considered an invasive species in several states because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete local flora.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread through manual removal and herbicide application.</p>
