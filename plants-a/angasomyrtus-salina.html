                    <h1>Angasomyrtus salina</h1>
<p>Angasomyrtus salina, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to saline soils and coastal environments.</p>
<p>Angasomyrtus salina is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh landscapes.</p>
