<p>Astrophyllum dumosum, commonly known as the dense-leaf cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that often form a low, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Astrophyllum dumosum is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
