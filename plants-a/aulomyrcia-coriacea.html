                    <h1>Aulomyrcia coriacea</h1>
<p>Aulomyrcia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved evergreen, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal forests.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control in coastal areas.</p>
