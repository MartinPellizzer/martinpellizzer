<p>Athyrium filix-femina var. asplenioides, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common lady fern.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America, characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided, arching leaves that give it a graceful appearance.</p>
