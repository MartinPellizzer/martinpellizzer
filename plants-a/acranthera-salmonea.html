                <h1>Acranthera salmonea</h1>
<p>Acranthera salmonea, commonly known as the salmon lily, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, salmon-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while the stem is short and erect.</p>
<p>Acranthera salmonea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera salmonea has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, dark green surface and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal spikes, featuring pale pink to white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera salmonea is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, typically in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. The plant thrives in the understory of dense forest canopies, where it receives filtered sunlight. It is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats within the island's diverse ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species to Borneo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera salmonea was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly associated with disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and dunes. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. Its introduction has been linked to both natural dispersal and human activities.</p>
<p>It is considered a potential invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new habitats.</p>
