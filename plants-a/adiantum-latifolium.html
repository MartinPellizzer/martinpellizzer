                <h1>Adiantum latifolium</h1>
<p>Adiantum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with slender, arching stems. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are glossy and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance with a pale underside.</p>
<p>Adiantum latifolium is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum latifolium has fern-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a bright green color and a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and wiry with a smooth, pale green bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, appearing in late spring to early summer. The fruit is a cluster of spores, and the plant disperses them through wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum latifolium is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil South, Brazil Southeast, Brazil West-Central, Central American Pacific Is., Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Jamaica, Leeward Is., Mexico Gulf, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, Nicaragua, Panam√°, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Suriname, Trinidad-Tobago, Venezuela, and Windward Is.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including rocky outcrops and wetlands, across its extensive native range. The plant is known for its delicate, lace-like fronds and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its widespread distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions throughout the Americas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum latifolium was mainly introduced to the Andaman Is., Bangladesh, India, Malaya, Nicobar Is., Sri Lanka, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is a fern species that has been widely distributed across these regions, likely due to its adaptability to tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its introduction to these locations may have occurred through natural dispersal or human activity.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity.</p>
