                <h1>Acronia sanluisii</h1>
<p>Acronia sanluisii, commonly known as the San Luis acronia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its flowering period occurs during the summer months.</p>
<p>Acronia sanluisii is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia sanluisii has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia sanluisii is primarily native to the central and southern regions of Mexico, specifically in the states of San Luis Potos√≠, Guanajuato, and parts of the Mexican Plateau.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry to semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant is adapted to withstand periods of drought and high temperatures. It is commonly found in scrublands and along the edges of forests in these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia sanluisii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as chaparral and desert scrub. This plant was introduced as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. It has since spread into natural areas, raising concerns about its impact on native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its introduction, it remains a rare and localized species in its non-native range.</p>
