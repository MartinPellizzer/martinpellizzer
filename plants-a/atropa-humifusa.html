                    <h1>Atropa humifusa</h1>
<p>Atropa humifusa, commonly known as the creeping belladonna, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries are small, red, and toxic, containing tropane alkaloids.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often found in shaded, moist woodland areas and is considered a noxious weed in some regions.</p>
