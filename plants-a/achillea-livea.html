                <h1>Achillea livea</h1>
<p>Achillea livea, commonly known as the live fern, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and yellow to orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Achillea livea is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea livea has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene, with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried over short distances.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, enabling the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea livea is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey.</p>
<p>It is now found in various regions of the Middle East and has been introduced to other parts of the world, including southern Europe and North Africa. This species thrives in dry, rocky, and sandy soils, often growing in open habitats such as steppes and shrublands. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea livea is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though it faces threats from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea livea is a hardy perennial plant known for its daisy-like flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, though it often behaves as a short-lived perennial, blooming in its second year before dying back.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with more frequent irrigation during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in damp conditions.</p>
