<p>Adenocarpus faurei, commonly known as the Cape mountain thistle, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Adenocarpus faurei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus faurei has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that has a slightly rough texture.
