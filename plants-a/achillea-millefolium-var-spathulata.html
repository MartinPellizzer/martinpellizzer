<p>Achillea millefolium var. spathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with finely divided, feather-like leaves that are narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is complemented by its historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
