                <h1>Achillea millefolium var. spathulata</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. spathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are narrower than those of the typical *Achillea millefolium*. The plant produces clusters of small, flat-topped flower heads in shades of white, pink, or red, depending on the cultivar. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. spathulata has leaves that are broadly ovate to spatulate in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length; they are typically a dark green color with a silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, rigid, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age, and it grows in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn; they are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, enabling the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. spathulata is a variant of the yarrow plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is now found in various regions of the world, including Europe, North America, and parts of Asia, often as an introduced species. This plant thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 4,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Despite its widespread distribution, it is considered a rare variant with a conservation status that varies by region, often listed as threatened due to habitat loss and limited population size.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. spathulata is a hardy perennial known for its attractive, fern-like foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that involves a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. spathulata is a hardy perennial that provides nectar and pollen for pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while also offering shelter and food for small wildlife.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit acts as an effective erosion control plant, stabilizing soil in disturbed areas. It attracts beneficial insects that help maintain a balanced ecosystem. The plant also serves as a companion plant for other garden species due to its ability to improve soil health.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity of the landscape by supporting a variety of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. spathulata is a perennial plant known for its ornamental value in gardens due to its attractive, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers.</p>
