                <h1>Acridocarpus zanzibaricus var. brachyphyllus</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus zanzibaricus var. brachyphyllus, commonly known as Zanzibar sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and distinctive leaves that are short and narrow. The plant typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils, adapting to saline and wind-prone environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, while its fruits are woody capsules containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus zanzibaricus var. brachyphyllus has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a dense branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus zanzibaricus var. brachyphyllus is a rare plant native to the coastal areas of Zanzibar and nearby islands in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few small populations on the island of Unguja, primarily in the southern regions. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained sandy soils near the shoreline. This variety typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 100 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, it is classified as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus zanzibaricus var. brachyphyllus is a unique and ornamental plant known for its distinctive foliage and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in warm climates and requiring a period of dormancy during cooler months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation to prevent root rot. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like hibiscus or dracaena can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>
