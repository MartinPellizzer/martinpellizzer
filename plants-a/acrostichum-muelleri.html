                <h1>Acrostichum muelleri</h1>
<p>Acrostichum muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, elliptical pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum muelleri has large, broad, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and woody, with a rough, fibrous bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are yellow-green in color and bloom during the spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, helping it anchor in moist, tropical soils.</p>
