                    <h1>Artemisia campestris var. spithamaea</h1>
<p>Artemisia campestris var. spithamaea, commonly known as marsh wormwood, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marshy areas of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soil. It thrives in poorly drained soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora.</p>
<p>Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone, which have been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>
