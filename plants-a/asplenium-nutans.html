                    <h1>Asplenium nutans</h1>
<p>Asplenium nutans, commonly known as the nodding spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, walls, and soil banks. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that curl downward, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Asplenium nutans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
