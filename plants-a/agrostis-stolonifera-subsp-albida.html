<p>Agrostis stolonifera subsp.</p>
<p>albida, commonly known as the white meadow grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in open, moist habitats such as meadows, lawns, and disturbed soils. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control.</p>
