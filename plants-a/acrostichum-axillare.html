                <h1>Acrostichum axillare</h1>
<p>Acrostichum axillare, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled or rolled. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Acrostichum axillare is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum axillare has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and has a light green color, growing in a climbing or trailing pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers with no distinct petals, blooming in late spring, and is primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through dryness and wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in moist environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum axillare is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangroves, and wetlands where it thrives in saline or brackish water conditions. This plant is also present in parts of the Caribbean, including the islands of the Greater and Lesser Antilles. It is often associated with disturbed soils and can be found in swampy or marshy habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to its ability to tolerate high salinity and waterlogged environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum axillare was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites due to its tolerance for saline and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and frequent rainfall, such as tropical and subtropical climates. This plant has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes contribute to its success in new environments.</p>
<p>However, it is also used in erosion control and as a ornamental plant in certain regions.</p>
