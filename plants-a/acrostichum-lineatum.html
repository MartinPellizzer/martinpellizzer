                <h1>Acrostichum lineatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum lineatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, compound fronds that are typically narrow and linear in shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies. Its leaves are composed of multiple pinnae, which are small, lance-shaped segments.</p>
<p>Acrostichum lineatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lineatum has large, elongated, feather-like leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and unbranched, with a smooth, grayish bark that grows vertically. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that bloom in the spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a dark brown, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lineatum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swampy areas, and along riverbanks where there is consistent moisture. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. Its native range extends from Mexico through the Caribbean to northern South America.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in southern Florida and the Bahamas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lineatum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and wetlands where it thrives in humid, saline environments.</p>
<p>It has been reported in regions such as Florida, the Caribbean, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant spreads primarily through its rhizomes, which allow it to colonize new areas rapidly. It is often found in disturbed habitats, including dunes and tidal zones.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to invade native ecosystems in these regions.</p>
