<p>Amsinckia decumbens, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, sprawling stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers with ray florets that resemble those of a sunflower, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Amsinckia decumbens is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert regions.</p>
