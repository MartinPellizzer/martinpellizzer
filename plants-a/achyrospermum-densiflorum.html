                <h1>Achyrospermum densiflorum</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum densiflorum, commonly known as the denseflower false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>The plant is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum densiflorum has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale purple petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum densiflorum is primarily native to Assam, Bangladesh, East Himalaya, Hainan, Jawa, Lesser Sunda Is., Myanmar, Nepal, Philippines, Sumatera, Thailand, Tibet.</p>
<p>It is found in a variety of habitats across these regions, including forest margins, grasslands, and rocky areas. The plant is commonly observed in tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils. Its distribution spans from the eastern Himalayas to the Southeast Asian islands.</p>
<p>It is a common ornamental and medicinal plant in many of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum densiflorum was mainly introduced to the Marianas.</p>
<p>It is an invasive species that has spread across various habitats in the region. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce prolifically contribute to its success in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>However, it poses a threat to local biodiversity and may alter the ecological balance in the Marianas.</p>
