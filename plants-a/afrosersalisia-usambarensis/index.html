                            <h1>Afrosersalisia Usambarensis</h1>
<p>Afrosersalisia usambarensis is a rare and striking plant native to the montane forests of eastern Africa. This unique species belongs to the family Malvaceae and is known for its large, showy flowers that bloom in vibrant shades of red and purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense woodlands. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its distinctive appearance and ecological importance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
