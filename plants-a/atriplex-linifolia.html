                    <h1>Atriplex linifolia</h1>
<p>Atriplex linifolia, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to harsh, saline environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, enhancing its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Atriplex linifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and thrive in poor, salty conditions.</p>
