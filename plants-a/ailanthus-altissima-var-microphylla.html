<p>Ailanthus altissima var. microphylla, commonly known as the Chinese tree of heaven, is a variant of the tree of heaven species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller, more rounded leaves compared to the typical variety, which are often deeply lobed and have a distinctive silvery underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is a fast-growing, deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, making it a dominant species in urban and disturbed environments.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a problematic species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
