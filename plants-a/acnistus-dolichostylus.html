                <h1>Acnistus dolichostylus</h1>
<p>Acnistus dolichostylus, commonly known as the long-styled acnistus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is a shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a rough texture with serrated edges.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in wet or swampy habitats, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus dolichostylus has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually light green and vary in size from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and hairy, with a light green to brownish bark that becomes rough as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus dolichostylus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in the understory of tropical rainforests. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soils. It is also occasionally found in parts of northern Australia.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be seen in disturbed habitats or along the edges of forests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus dolichostylus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its aggressive growth has led to concerns over its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
