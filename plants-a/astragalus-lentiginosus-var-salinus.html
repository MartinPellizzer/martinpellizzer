                    <h1>Astragalus lentiginosus var. salinus</h1>
<p>Astragalus lentiginosus var. salinus, commonly known as the saltbush milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant thrives in saline soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high salt concentrations. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, playing a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
