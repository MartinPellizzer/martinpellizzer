<p>Armeria canescens subsp.</p>
<p>gracilis, commonly known as slender sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and western Europe. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with dense clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help it retain moisture in its arid, coastal habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
