                    <h1>Argythamnia cuneifolia</h1>
<p>Argythamnia cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible but have a strong, acidic flavor. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control in dry climates.</p>
