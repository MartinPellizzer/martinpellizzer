<p>Acacia cylindriflora, commonly known as the cylindrical-flowered wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, yellow floral spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The leaves are phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as the primary photosynthetic organs. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acacia cylindriflora is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and heat.</p>
