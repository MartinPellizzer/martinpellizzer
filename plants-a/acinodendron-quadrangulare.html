                <h1>Acinodendron quadrangulare</h1>
<p>Acinodendron quadrangulare, commonly known as the four-angled acacia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its quadrangular stems and compound leaves with small, paired leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its fruits are pod-like structures that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron quadrangulare has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth texture and a dark green upper surface contrasting with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly quadrangular in cross-section, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule containing several small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron quadrangulare is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in regions with warm climates and abundant rainfall. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and can be found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends to parts of the Philippines and the Indian subcontinent as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron quadrangulare was mainly introduced to the southern and eastern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, often growing in disturbed habitats. The plant has been reported in several states including Queensland, New South Wales, and South Australia. Its introduction is believed to be through human activities such as landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to limited data on its spread and effects on native flora.</p>
