                <h1>Achyranthes piloselloides</h1>
<p>Achyranthes piloselloides, commonly known as the hairy dock, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect stem and alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by elongated, ribbed seed pods. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes piloselloides has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green lower surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in spikes, blooming in summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes piloselloides is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Sudan, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found in grasslands, savannas, and along riverbanks. It is often considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to human activity and environmental conditions that support its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes piloselloides was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as landscaping and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed soils and can quickly colonize open areas, making it a common invasive species in certain regions. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds contribute to its successful establishment in non-native environments. It is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and along irrigation channels.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it poses challenges to native plant communities in invaded areas.</p>
