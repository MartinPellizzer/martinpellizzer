                    <h1>Angraecum seretii</h1>
<p>Angraecum seretii, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence bearing numerous white, star-shaped flowers with a distinctive dark purple or violet center. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Angraecum seretii is notable for its nocturnal pollination mechanism, relying on hawkmoths to transfer pollen.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
