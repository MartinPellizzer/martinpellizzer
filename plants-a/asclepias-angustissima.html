                    <h1>Asclepias angustissima</h1>
<p>Asclepias angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive hooded buds, which open to reveal five petals and a central cluster of horn-like structures. It is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays an important role in supporting pollinators.</p>
<p>Its latex sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many herbivores but beneficial for certain insect species.</p>
