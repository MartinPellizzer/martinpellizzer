                <h1>Aconitum tenue</h1>
<p>Aconitum tenue, commonly known as the slender aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, typically arranged in racemes. Its leaves are palmately divided and have a distinctive, somewhat hairy texture.</p>
<p>Aconitum tenue contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires caution in handling and cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum tenue has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and grows in a straight, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are blue to purple in color, arranged in racemes, with showy petals and a spurred structure, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, helping the plant to store nutrients and survive in various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tenue is primarily native to Montana and South Dakota.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in forested areas. This plant is commonly found in the northern and central regions of these states. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>Aconitum tenue plays an important role in local ecosystems and is often seen in wildflower gardens.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tenue was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue-violet flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond gardens into natural ecosystems, posing a threat to native flora. The plant is considered invasive in some regions because of its rapid growth and competitive nature. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas.</p>
<p>Control measures are recommended to prevent its further spread and protect local biodiversity.</p>
