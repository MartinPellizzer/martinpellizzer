                        <h1>Acacia terminalis</h1>
<p>Acacia terminalis, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.
