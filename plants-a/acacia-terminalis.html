                    <h1>Acacia terminalis</h1>
<p>Acacia terminalis, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, woody pods containing flat, brown seeds. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes and sandy plains.</p>
<p>Acacia terminalis plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and provides habitat for various insects and birds.</p>
