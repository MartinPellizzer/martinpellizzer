                    <h1>Asplenium reflexum</h1>
<p>Asplenium reflexum, commonly known as the zigzag holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often curve in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, brown covering.</p>
<p>Asplenium reflexum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
