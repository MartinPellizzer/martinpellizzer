<p>Anthoxanthum racemosum, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and the ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers moist, well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Anthoxanthum racemosum is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats.</p>
