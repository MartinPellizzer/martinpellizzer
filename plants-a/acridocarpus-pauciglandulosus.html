                <h1>Acridocarpus pauciglandulosus</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus pauciglandulosus, commonly known as the small glanded hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Its leaves are ovate and covered with small glands, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus pauciglandulosus has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus pauciglandulosus is primarily native to Tanzania.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the dry, scrubland areas of the country. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing along rocky outcrops. The species is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is sometimes used in traditional practices.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus pauciglandulosus was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It has been observed in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of Australia. The plant is often found in disturbed environments such as roadsides, forest edges, and degraded landscapes. Its introduction is likely due to human activities, including accidental dispersal through trade or cultivation.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to limited data on its spread and effects on native flora.</p>
