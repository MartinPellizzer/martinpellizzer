<p>Asplenium terrestre subsp.</p>
<p>maritimum, commonly known as the coastal spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed.</p>
<p>This fern is adapted to salt-laden air and sandy soils, often growing on rocky substrates or in shaded, moist areas near the shoreline. Its rhizomes form dense mats, helping to stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The plant plays a minor but ecologically significant role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
