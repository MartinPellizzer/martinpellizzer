<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>torminaloides, commonly known as the Tatarian maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3â€“6 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical, with serrated margins and a yellow-green underside, turning vibrant red in the fall. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.</p>
