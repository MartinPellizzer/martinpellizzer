                <h1>Acer pseudoplatanus var. subintegrilobum</h1>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. subintegrilobum, commonly known as the rounded-lobed maple, is a variant of the common maple characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically larger and more rounded compared to the standard variety, with fewer and more pronounced lobes. The plant is native to the western regions of Europe and thrives in temperate climates. It produces small, red or orange-red samaras that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its striking autumn foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. subintegrilobum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a serrated edge, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and grows upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. subintegrilobum is a variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and parts of the Alps.</p>
<p>Although it is not widely cultivated, it has been introduced to other areas, including parts of the United Kingdom and northern Europe. This plant thrives in temperate climates, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 800 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and rarity in the wild, it is considered a rare species with a conservation status that warrants attention.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. subintegrilobum is a unique variant of the maple tree known for its distinctive foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering a more reliable method for maintaining cultivar characteristics. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years, making it suitable for long-term landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil with a slightly acidic to neutral pH and requires regular watering during dry periods without becoming waterlogged. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning is minimal, mainly for shaping and removing dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other shade-loving plants like ferns or heathers can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. subintegrilobum is a variant of the maple tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other plant species. Its deep roots help in erosion control by holding soil in place during heavy rains.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in carbon sequestration, offering ecological benefits that support overall environmental health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. subintegrilobum is a rare variant of the maple tree known for its ornamental value in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential medicinal properties, such as anti-inflammatory effects. In industrial contexts, its wood is not commonly harvested for economic purposes due to its limited availability and slow growth. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in regions where it is cultivated, often representing resilience and adaptability.</p>
<p>Its presence in botanical gardens and conservation efforts highlights its role in preserving biodiversity and ecological heritage.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. subintegrilobum has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Crimson King' and 'Emerald Queen', which display striking foliage colors.</p>
<p>It is also involved in the creation of hybrids with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, resulting in unique varieties with enhanced horticultural traits. These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and more vibrant autumn coloration. The cultivars and hybrids of this variety are highly valued in gardens for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>Due to their visual impact, they hold significant horticultural importance in both ornamental and landscape design.</p>
