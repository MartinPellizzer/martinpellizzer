<p>Alhagi maurorum subsp.</p>
<p>canescens, commonly known as the desert bean or sand milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant produces slender, pod-like fruits containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
