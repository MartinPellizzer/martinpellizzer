<p>Arrhenatherum pubescens f. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine feather grass, is a variant of the feather grass species native to alpine and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and slender, grass-like blades that form dense, low-growing clumps. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. Its flowering stems produce small, greenish spikelets that are typically inconspicuous.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh alpine environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
