                <h1>Acer negundo var. normalis</h1>
<p>Acer negundo var. normalis, commonly known as the box elder, is a deciduous tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three to five leaflets, and its distinctive winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. The tree thrives in a variety of soil types and is adaptable to different environmental conditions. It often grows in moist areas, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and can reach heights of up to 30 meters.</p>
<p>The bark of the tree is smooth when young but becomes fissured with age, adding to its distinctive appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer negundo var. normalis has palmately compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with 5-7 leaflets that are ovate to elliptic in shape, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, turning yellow in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during early spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with twoç¿… (wings), dispersing by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer negundo var. normalis is a variant of the box elder tree native to eastern North America, specifically the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in the northeastern and midwestern regions, its current distribution includes areas where it has been introduced, such as parts of Europe and Asia. It thrives in a variety of environments, including moist woodlands, stream banks, and disturbed soils, and is commonly found at low to moderate altitudes.</p>
<p>Despite its adaptability, it is not considered a threatened species and is generally stable in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer negundo var. normalis is a fast-growing tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle includes a period of rapid growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer negundo var. normalis is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers and serves as a habitat for numerous small animals. The tree acts as a companion plant in urban landscapes, helping to reduce air pollution and improve aesthetic value. Its extensive root system also aids in erosion control by stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity of the ecosystem by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer negundo var. normalis is a fast-growing tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is primarily used in landscaping and urban environments for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shade. While not commonly used in culinary applications, its young leaves can be consumed in some traditional cuisines. In medicinal contexts, it has been used in folk remedies for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Industrially, it contributes to reforestation efforts and provides timber for construction and paper production.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer negundo var. normalis has several popular cultivars, including 'Autumn Flame' and 'Sycamore Maple', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and adaptability.</p>
<p>It is also frequently used in hybridization to create ornamental trees with improved traits such as disease resistance and growth habits. Hybrids involving Acer negundo var. normalis often combine the hardiness of the sycamore with the aesthetic appeal of other maple species. These hybrids are valuable in horticulture for landscaping and urban forestry due to their tolerance of various soil types and climates.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer negundo var. normalis plays an important role in the development of ornamental and functional tree species.</p>
