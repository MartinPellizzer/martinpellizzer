                <h1>Aegilops turcica</h1>
<p>Aegilops turcica, commonly known as the Turkish goatgrass, is a wild annual grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown bracts. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Aegilops turcica is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops turcica has alternate, narrow, linear leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and smooth, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in dense tufts. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, pale blue to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-lobed caryopsis, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid environments.</p>
