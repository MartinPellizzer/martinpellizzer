                <h1>Acalypha glandulifera</h1>
<p>Acalypha glandulifera, commonly known as the sticky or glandular leaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky glands, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces showy, hibiscus-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and yellow, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Acalypha glandulifera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to various parts of the world as a garden plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha glandulifera has heart-shaped or ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green to brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and light, adapted for aerial transport.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha glandulifera is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While it was originally restricted to its native range, it is now also cultivated in other tropical regions for its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, tropical environments, often growing in lowland forests or near streams. This species is typically found at altitudes between 0 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though its wild populations are not well-documented.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha glandulifera is a tropical plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth patterns.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster results. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid conditions and reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>
