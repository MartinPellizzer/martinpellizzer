                    <h1>Anura</h1>
<p>Anura, commonly known as frogs, are a group of amphibians belonging to the order Anura, characterized by their lack of a tail and the presence of a tongue adapted for capturing prey.</p>
<p>Botanically, they are not plants, so they do not have the typical botanical features such as roots, stems, leaves, or flowers. However, their habitat often includes aquatic or moist environments where plants play a crucial role in their ecosystem. Frogs rely on these environments for breeding and shelter, highlighting the interdependence between aquatic plants and amphibian life cycles.</p>
<p>Their presence can indicate the health of an ecosystem, as they are sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
