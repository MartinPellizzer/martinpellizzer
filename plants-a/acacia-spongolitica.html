                    <h1>Acacia spongolitica</h1>
<p>Acacia spongolitica, commonly known as the spongeleaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, sponge-like hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seed pods are woody and contain small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acacia spongolitica is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
