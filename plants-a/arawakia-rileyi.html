The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by elliptical, dark blue-black fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Arawakia rileyi is of interest to botanists for its potential ecological role and unique morphological features.</p>
