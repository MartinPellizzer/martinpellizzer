                <h1>Acrolepis ferruginea</h1>
<p>Acrolepis ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty acrolepis, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly referred to as the ice plant family. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its water-storing tissues.</p>
<p>Acrolepis ferruginea is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for cultivation in xerophytic gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolepis ferruginea has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and has a rough, reddish-brown bark that peels off in small flakes. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the winter months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolepis ferruginea is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in rocky outcrops and sandy soils. This plant thrives in coastal and inland areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It is often seen in fynbos vegetation in the Western Cape province of South Africa.</p>
<p>Acrolepis ferruginea is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is an important component of local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolepis ferruginea was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in the region. The plant was likely introduced through human activities, such as accidental transport on contaminated soil or machinery. It has spread rapidly in coastal areas and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its presence has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
