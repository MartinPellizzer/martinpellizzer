                <h1>Acrodiclidium peckii</h1>
<p>Acrodiclidium peckii, commonly known as the Peck's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acrodiclidium peckii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrodiclidium peckii has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a greenish center, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodiclidium peckii is primarily native to the arid regions of southern Africa, specifically Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in the Namib Desert and adjacent areas. It is well adapted to extreme drought conditions and high temperatures. Acrodiclidium peckii is often seen growing on rocky outcrops and in coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the unique ecological conditions of these desert environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodiclidium peckii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate temperatures and sufficient sunlight. This plant has shown rapid growth and spread in invasive plant communities. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its competitive nature and potential impact on native flora.</p>
<p>It is now considered a weed in several regions where it has established itself.</p>
