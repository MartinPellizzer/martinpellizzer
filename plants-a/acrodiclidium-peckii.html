                    <h1>Acrodiclidium peckii</h1>
<p>Acrodiclidium peckii, commonly known as the Peck's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acrodiclidium peckii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
