                <h1>Acer johnedwardianum</h1>
<p>Acer johnedwardianum, commonly known as the Edward's maple, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are essential for its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer johnedwardianum has palmately compound leaves with five to seven leaflets that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, turning red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, and is wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer johnedwardianum is a rare species of maple native to the mountainous regions of southern China, specifically in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>While it was once found in its native range, its current distribution is limited and it is now considered extinct in the wild. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, typically found in temperate forests. It grows at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,000 meters, where it faces harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Acer johnedwardianum is listed as critically endangered, with only a few cultivated specimens remaining in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer johnedwardianum is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its vibrant fall foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or cuttings, with seed propagation requiring stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle of this plant includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with other shade-loving plants like ferns and hostas in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer johnedwardianum is a rare and unique maple species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and promoting the growth of other native species. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and protecting waterways.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer johnedwardianum contributes to carbon sequestration, playing a vital role in maintaining ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer johnedwardianum is a rare and ornamental tree native to Bhutan, known for its distinctive copper-colored leaves and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts. In medicinal contexts, there is limited research on its properties, though traditional practices may use parts of the tree for local remedies. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports local ecosystems, playing a role in sustainable forestry and environmental conservation.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic value in Bhutanese tradition, representing natural beauty and ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer johnedwardianum has a limited number of naturally occurring varieties, but it is not widely cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
<p>While it does not have many popular cultivars due to its rarity and limited horticultural use, some botanic gardens may propagate it for conservation or research. Hybridization with other maple species is rare, as the plant is generally not favored for breeding due to its small size and limited ornamental appeal. Its horticultural importance lies more in its ecological value and botanical interest than in aesthetic garden use.</p>
<p>As a result, it remains a subject of scientific study rather than a common garden plant.</p>
