                <h1>Acer johnedwardianum</h1>
<p>Acer johnedwardianum, commonly known as Edward's maple, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters, characterized by its slender trunk and delicate, palmate leaves. The leaves are usually green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn, adding to its ornamental value. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer johnedwardianum has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-7 cm in length, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer johnedwardianum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern China, specifically in the provinces of Hubei, Sichuan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, with no known cultivation outside its native habitat. It thrives in moist, temperate forests with rich soil and partial shade, typically found in mixed evergreen and deciduous woodlands. This species is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer johnedwardianum is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer johnedwardianum is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its striking red foliage and compact growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of this plant is slow, with new growth appearing in spring and a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during the growing season, though it should be allowed to dry out slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the plant and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or scale insects, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials like ferns or heathers can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer johnedwardianum is a rare tree species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a variety of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer johnedwardianum is a rare tree species native to the Himalayas, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its wood is valued for its fine texture and durability, making it suitable for small-scale woodworking and carving. In traditional medicine, its leaves and bark have been used to treat skin conditions and as a mild astringent. Culturally, it holds symbolic importance in local communities, representing resilience and the beauty of mountainous landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it plays a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer johnedwardianum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are of interest to horticulturists.</p>
<p>Among its popular cultivars are 'Aconitifolium' and 'Cunninghamii', which are known for their striking foliage and ornamental value. Hybrids involving Acer johnedwardianum are occasionally created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and leaf coloration. These plants hold horticultural importance due to their unique appearance and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>Their cultivation contributes to the diversity of ornamental trees available for landscaping and botanical gardens.</p>
