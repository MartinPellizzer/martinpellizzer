                <h1>Acer tegmentosum subsp. hersii</h1>
<p>Acer tegmentosum subsp.</p>
<p>hersii, commonly known as the western sugar maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, clustered green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum subsp.</p>
<p>hersii has alternate, palmately compound leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside; the leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm in length and exhibit a vibrant red to orange coloration in autumn. The stem is slender and erect, with smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures, and it grows in a shrub-like form.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum subsp.</p>
<p>hersii is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in areas of Sichuan and Hubei provinces. While its native range is limited, it is now also found in some botanical gardens and conservation facilities outside its original habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically in mixed forests. It is usually found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer tegmentosum subsp.</p>
<p>hersii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum subsp.</p>
<p>hersii is a hardy deciduous tree known for its vibrant fall color and ornamental value. It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The tree follows a typical temperate growth cycle, shedding its leaves in winter and regrowing them in spring.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its structure and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials like coneflowers or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum subsp.</p>
<p>hersii is a native shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of nearby species through improved soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by supporting a diverse array of insects and animals within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum subsp.</p>
<p>hersii is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas. It has potential medicinal applications, as some species of the genus Acer are used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>While not widely used in industrial applications, its wood may have local economic value in small-scale crafts or fuel. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain indigenous communities, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and traditional rather than commercial.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum subsp.</p>
<p>hersii has several popular cultivars, including 'Crimson Queen' and 'Redmond,' which are prized for their vibrant autumn foliage. It is also commonly hybridized with other maples, such as Acer palmatum, to produce ornamental varieties with enhanced color and form.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit improved hardiness and extended display periods, making them more adaptable to different climates. Horticulturally, this species is valued for its ornamental potential in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its unique leaf patterns and seasonal color changes contribute to its popularity among plant enthusiasts.</p>
