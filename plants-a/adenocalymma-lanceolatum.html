                <h1>Adenocalymma lanceolatum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or swampy areas.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma lanceolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma lanceolatum has alternate, lanceolate leaves that are typically 5–10 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often branching from the base, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, clustered in inflorescences, and bloom during the summer months; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma lanceolatum is primarily native to eastern Australia, including New South Wales, Queensland, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or loamy soils. The plant thrives in open habitats such as heathlands, woodlands, and coastal dunes. It is well adapted to the temperate climate of these regions, with seasonal flowering patterns.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma lanceolatum plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma lanceolatum was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in the warm, humid climate. The plant is often seen growing along the edges of forests and in disturbed habitats. Its introduction has led to some concerns about its potential invasive behavior in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major threat at this time.</p>
