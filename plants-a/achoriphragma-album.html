                <h1>Achoriphragma album</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma album, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Achoriphragma album is often found in rocky areas and along dry streambeds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma album has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a glossy green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma album is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, thriving in dry and sunny environments. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, often growing on slopes and cliffs. It is also present in certain regions of the Middle East and has been introduced to other areas with similar climates.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to specific ecological conditions that support its growth and survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma album was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive white flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in coastal areas and disturbed soils, making it difficult to control.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists in New Zealand.</p>
