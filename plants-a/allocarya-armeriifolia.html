<p>Allocarya armeriifolia, commonly known as the woollyleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle floral display to its habitat. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open areas.</p>
<p>Allocarya armeriifolia is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range.</p>
