                <h1>Acer orientale f. obtusifolium</h1>
<p>Acer orientale f. obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaf maple, is a unique variant of the oriental maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are less serrated compared to the typical species. The plant is native to China and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its foliage provides a striking visual appeal, especially during the fall when it displays vibrant colors.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer orientale f. obtusifolium has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a rounded or obtuse tip, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, turning red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, light brown bark that develops shallow fissures with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer orientale f. obtusifolium is a rare variant of the oriental maple, native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific areas in Turkey, particularly in the Taurus Mountains. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is typically found in forested slopes and rocky areas. This species grows at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer orientale f. obtusifolium is a slow-growing, ornamental maple known for its broad, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster and more reliable results. This species prefers well-drained, fertile soil and moderate watering, especially during its active growth cycle in spring and summer. Fertilize it lightly in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune dead or diseased branches in late winter to maintain shape and health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with flowering shrubs and perennials for a decorative garden effect.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer orientale f. obtusifolium is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of nearby species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving air quality and offering aesthetic value to the landscape.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer orientale f. obtusifolium is a rare maple species known for its ornamental value in horticulture and landscaping due to its unique foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves have been studied for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. The tree's wood, though not commonly used in industry, contributes to local economies in regions where it is native. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some traditional practices, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its conservation is important for maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer orientale f. obtusifolium has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their unique foliage and ornamental value, including 'Crimson Queen' and 'Variegatum', which showcase striking coloration and leaf patterns.</p>
<p>This form is also the parent of several hybrids, such as Acer Ã— carpinifolium, which combines the characteristics of Acer orientale with those of Acer negundo. These hybrids are often used in horticulture for their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes. The cultivars and hybrids of Acer orientale f. obtusifolium are particularly valued for their ability to thrive in a range of climates and soil conditions.</p>
<p>Their horticultural importance lies in their contribution to landscape design and their role in ornamental horticulture.</p>
