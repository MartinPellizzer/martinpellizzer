                <h1>Arachnites alpinus</h1>
<p>Arachnites alpinus, commonly known as the alpine moss rose, is a small, cushion-like plant belonging to the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in alpine and arctic regions. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Arachnites alpinus produces tiny, star-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, and it is adapted to survive in cold, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
