<p>Achnatherum chingii, commonly known as the Chinese needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to China and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of small hairs.</p>
<p>Achnatherum chingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
