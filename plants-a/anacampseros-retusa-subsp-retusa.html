<p>Anacampseros retusa subsp.</p>
<p>retusa, commonly known as the slender stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring or summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
