                <h1>Acmella pectinata</h1>
<p>Acmella pectinata, commonly known as the spiked tickseed, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers are composed of ray florets and tubular disc florets, typical of the daisy family.</p>
<p>Acmella pectinata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella pectinata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, slightly woody bark that has a light brown color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, yellow with a central dark red spot, and they bloom during the dry season, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out underground, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella pectinata is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in countries such as Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is now distributed in various regions where it has been introduced, including parts of the United States and Australia. This species thrives in moist, sunny environments, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. It typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 500 meters.</p>
<p>Acmella pectinata is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not currently at risk of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella pectinata is a vibrant flowering plant known for its bright yellow flowers and is commonly grown as an ornamental.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. The growth cycle of Acmella pectinata includes a period of rapid growth followed by blooming, typically during the warm months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushiness are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
