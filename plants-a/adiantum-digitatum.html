<p>Adiantum digitatum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of polypod fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the feathers of a bird, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in nighttime pollination.</p>
<p>Adiantum digitatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
