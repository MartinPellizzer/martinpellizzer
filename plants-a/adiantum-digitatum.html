                <h1>Adiantum digitatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum digitatum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of polypod fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the feathers of a bird, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in nighttime pollination.</p>
<p>Adiantum digitatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum digitatum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 10â€“30 cm long, arranged alternately along the stem, and have a light green color with a slightly serrated margin. The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a spore-bearing capsule that disperses spores by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum digitatum is primarily native to Argentina Northwest, Argentina South, Bolivia, Brazil South, Ecuador, Peru, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates with high moisture levels. The plant is often seen growing on rocky substrates or in moist soil.</p>
<p>Its native range spans across several South American countries, reflecting its adaptability to diverse habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum digitatum was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become established in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in damp, shaded areas such as forest floors and along stream banks. The plant is considered an invasive species in some parts of its introduced range due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its spread is often facilitated by its ability to thrive in moist environments and its ease of propagation through spores.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
