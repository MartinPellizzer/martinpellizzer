                <h1>Achillea montenegrina</h1>
<p>Achillea montenegrina, commonly known as the Montenegro yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green leaves and flat, composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to temperate climates. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Achillea montenegrina is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea montenegrina has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a gray-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody at the base, and has a rough, grayish-brown bark. Its flowers are compound umbels with white to pale yellow petals, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea montenegrina is primarily native to the Balkan Peninsula, particularly Montenegro, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p>It thrives in mountainous regions and rocky soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This plant is commonly associated with limestone and calcareous substrates, growing in open areas such as meadows and grasslands. It is well adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in parts of southeastern Europe.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea montenegrina was mainly introduced to Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean region, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, flat-topped flower heads and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in gardens and landscaping projects across several countries, including Spain, Italy, and France. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation in natural habitats. Its introduction has led to concerns about its ecological impact, prompting management efforts in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, it remains popular among gardeners for its low maintenance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
