                <h1>Achillea montenegrina</h1>
<p>Achillea montenegrina, commonly known as the Montenegro yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and flat, composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Achillea montenegrina is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea montenegrina has basal leaves that are lanceolate to oblanceolate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-brown color, growing from the base to form a compact plant. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a cylindrical achene with a pappus, which is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea montenegrina is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula, specifically found in Montenegro and parts of southern Serbia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in the Dinaric Mountains. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 700 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Achillea montenegrina is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea montenegrina is a hardy perennial plant known for its vibrant yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its appearance and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea montenegrina is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering food and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by creating microhabitats for small invertebrates and supporting the broader ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea montenegrina is a flowering plant known for its potential medicinal uses, including its traditional application in treating wounds and inflammation due to its anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>It has also been explored for its possible culinary applications, though it is less commonly used in food compared to other members of the Asteraceae family. In industrial and economic contexts, it may contribute to local biodiversity and ecotourism, supporting regional economies. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in certain regions, often associated with healing and resilience.</p>
<p>However, further research is needed to fully understand its broader applications and potential benefits.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea montenegrina has several varieties and cultivars that are valued for their ornamental qualities and hardiness.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' and 'Paprika', which are known for their bright yellow and orange flower colors, respectively. While there are no widely recognized hybrids specifically bred for Achillea montenegrina, it is often crossed with other yarrow species to create new cultivars with enhanced traits. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in poor soils and its long blooming period, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>It is also appreciated for its ability to attract pollinators and its low maintenance requirements.</p>
