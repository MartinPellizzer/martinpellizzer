                    <h1>Aegilops × sancti-andreae</h1>
<p>Aegilops × sancti-andreae, commonly known as the San Andrea's wild rye, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Aegilops tauschii and Aegilops ventricosa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, grass-like appearance with long, narrow leaves and dense spikelets. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates. Due to its genetic makeup, it is often studied for its potential contributions to wheat improvement through hybrid breeding programs.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in agricultural research and plant genetics.</p>
