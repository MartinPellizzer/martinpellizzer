<p>Alopecurus utriculatus var. brachyatherus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mouse-ear, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, grassy areas such as meadows, ditches, and woodland edges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.
