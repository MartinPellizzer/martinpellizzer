                    <h1>Actinoseris</h1>
<p>Actinoseris, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. Actinoseris species are typically low-growing, mat-forming plants with small, often hairy leaves. They produce showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates.</p>
