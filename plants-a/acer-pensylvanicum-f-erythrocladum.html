<p>Acer pensylvanicum f. erythrocladum, commonly known as the red-leaf maple, is a rare and distinctive variant of the striped maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which becomes more intense in the fall, making it a visually appealing ornamental plant. The leaves are typically longer and narrower than those of the typical striped maple, with a more pronounced red coloration on the underside. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded areas of northern hardwood forests.</p>
<p>This form is less commonly cultivated but is valued for its unique aesthetic qualities in specialized horticultural settings.</p>
