<p>Angadenia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Australia and is characterized by its unique, delicate, and often ephemeral blooms. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, fragrant flowers that are often pale in color. Angadenia species are known for their short flowering period, which makes them rare and difficult to observe.</p>
<p>Due to their habitat specificity and limited distribution, many species are considered endangered.</p>
