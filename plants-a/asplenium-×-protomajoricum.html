                    <h1>Asplenium × protomajoricum</h1>
<p>Asplenium × protomajoricum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not found in the wild and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
