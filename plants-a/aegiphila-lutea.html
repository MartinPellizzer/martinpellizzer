<p>Aegiphila lutea, commonly known as the yellow aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and aromatic leaves that emit a strong scent. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Aegiphila lutea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila lutea has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody, with a pale greenish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellow petals and a pale greenish calyx, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
