                <h1>Adenocarpus bracteatus</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus bracteatus, commonly known as the African thornapple, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, inflated fruit capsules. Its leaves are usually small and opposite, with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its adaptability to arid conditions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus bracteatus has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with yellow petals and a prominent central stamen, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus bracteatus is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of South Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Lesotho, and Eswatini.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, savannas, and rocky outcrops within these areas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with dry to semi-arid climates. It is part of the legume family and plays a role in nitrogen fixation in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is also occasionally found in nearby regions with similar environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus bracteatus was mainly introduced to regions with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental or for erosion control.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with full sun exposure and is commonly found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and abandoned fields. The plant has been reported in several parts of the southeastern United States, including Texas and Florida. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely influenced by human activity and climate conditions.</p>
