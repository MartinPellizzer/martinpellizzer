<p>Aspidium glabrum var. soripes, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce fronds. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that features a broad, shield-shaped base.</p>
<p>The undersides of the fronds are covered in fine, hairy structures, which give the variety its common name.</p>
