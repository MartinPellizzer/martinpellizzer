<p>Antennaria incarnata, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate habit and tiny, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, often in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Antennaria incarnata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in open, disturbed areas.</p>
