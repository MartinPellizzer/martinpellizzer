                    <h1>Argythamnia neomexicana var. depressa</h1>
<p>Argythamnia neomexicana var. depressa, commonly known as the Mexican thornbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with woody stems and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, arid environments.</p>
