<p>Atriplex latifolia var. valida, commonly known as shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, salt-excreting hairs, a feature adapted to its saline and alkaline soils. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its robust root system allows it to thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife in desert ecosystems.</p>
