<p>Allantodia wichurae var. parawichurae, commonly known as the Parawichurae allantodia, is a rare and unique species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family, known for its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep violet. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern and is rarely found in cultivation.</p>
