<p>Arceuthobium campylopodum subsp.</p>
<p>littorum, commonly known as the coastal witchweed, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on its host for nutrients and water.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It is often found in coastal areas with sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
