                    <h1>Alsine holostea</h1>
<p>Alsine holostea, commonly known as the water bladdergrass, is a low-growing annual herb native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features small, egg-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, pale blue to purple flowers clustered in spikes. The plant is adapted to moist soils and can often be found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its seeds are encased in a bladder-like structure that aids in floating and dispersal.</p>
<p>Alsine holostea plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
