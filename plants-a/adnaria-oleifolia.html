                <h1>Adnaria oleifolia</h1>
<p>Adnaria oleifolia, commonly known as the Mediterranean senna, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, bean-like pods containing seeds. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Adnaria oleifolia is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria oleifolia has leaves that are simple, alternate, and elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria oleifolia is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, rocky shores, and along the edges of forests. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with coastal ecosystems. It is also present in parts of southern Italy, Spain, and the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>Adnaria oleifolia is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria oleifolia was mainly introduced to coastal and brackish water environments in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, saline habitats and is often found in estuaries and tidal zones. The plant's introduction has led to its spread along shorelines, where it can form dense mats that alter local ecosystems. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now expanding beyond its native range, impacting native flora and water quality.</p>
