                    <h1>Ascium goyasense</h1>
<p>Ascium goyasense, commonly known as the Goyasense cup fungus, is a unique species of ascomycete fungus characterized by its distinctive cup-shaped fruiting body.</p>
<p>It typically grows on decaying wood, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The fungus produces ascospores within the ascus, which are released to propagate the species. Its morphology includes a smooth or hairy surface, depending on the specific habitat.</p>
<p>Ascium goyasense is of interest to mycologists due to its ecological role in decomposing organic matter.</p>
