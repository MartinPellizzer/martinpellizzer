                <h1>Adinandra nitida</h1>
<p>Adinandra nitida, commonly known as the silver tree, is a flowering plant species native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, glossy leaves that give it a silver appearance. It produces small white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries.</p>
<p>Adinandra nitida is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra nitida has simple, elliptic leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in panicles, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, woody drupe that splits open to release smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in the plant's ability to absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra nitida is primarily native to China South-Central and China Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity. The plant is commonly found in forested areas and is often associated with secondary growth.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra nitida was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as secondary forests, grasslands, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high rainfall and warm temperatures. The plant is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems where it competes with native vegetation. Its introduction has been associated with human activities like deforestation and land clearing.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, posing a threat to local biodiversity.</p>
