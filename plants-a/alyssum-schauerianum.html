                    <h1>Alyssum schauerianum</h1>
<p>Alyssum schauerianum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features compact, mat-forming growth with silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves and stems are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Alyssum schauerianum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
