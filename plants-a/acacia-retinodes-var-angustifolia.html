                        <h1>Acacia retinodes var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia retinodes var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, angular stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that bloom in late winter to early spring. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system and waxy leaf coatings to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in native gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia retinodes var. angustifolia is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and rocky areas. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also influenced by soil type and availability of water.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia retinodes var. angustifolia was mainly introduced to areas with Mediterranean climates, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for regions with similar environmental conditions. This plant is often found in coastal and inland dunes, as well as disturbed sites such as roadsides and gravelly soils. Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions contributes to its successful establishment in these areas.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
