                <h1>Acer campestre var. vulgare</h1>
<p>Acer campestre var. vulgare, commonly known as the common hedge maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits called samaras. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often used as a hedging plant due to its dense growth habit.</p>
<p>The leaves and bark contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. vulgare has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are 3â€“7 cm long, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, turning yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a rounded crown. The flowers are small, yellow-green catkins that appear in early spring, with male and female flowers on separate trees, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a pair of winged samaras, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small with a thin, membranous wing.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. vulgare is a variant of the common maple that is native to Europe, particularly in the western and central regions, including parts of the British Isles, France, and Germany.</p>
<p>Currently, it has been introduced to various parts of North America and is found in gardens and urban landscapes. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks. This species typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to around 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>It is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status due to its adaptability and widespread distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. vulgare is a hardy, deciduous shrub known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings in spring or by layering, making it relatively easy to cultivate. The growth cycle of this plant involves rapid growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or roses can enhance its beauty and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. vulgare is a valuable component of woodland and hedgerow ecosystems, providing food and shelter for a variety of wildlife.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its berries serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It acts as a companion plant, enhancing the biodiversity of mixed plant communities. The roots of this species help in erosion control by stabilizing soil along stream banks and in open areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. vulgare is a small tree or shrub commonly known as the field maple, which has various uses and applications.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, its young leaves can be used in salads or as a seasoning, though it is not widely consumed.
