<p>Asplenium barisanicum, commonly known as the Barisan spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the mountainous areas of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Asplenium barisanicum is well adapted to humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in montane forests.</p>
