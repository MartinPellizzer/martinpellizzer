                <h1>Acmena caudata</h1>
<p>Acmena caudata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved apple or slender apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The tree produces edible, red, fleshy fruits that are similar in appearance to apples, though they are typically smaller. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like or small tree-like, with a compact form and dense foliage.</p>
<p>Acmena caudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a hedge plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena caudata has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in racemes, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena caudata is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in subtropical and tropical regions, particularly in coastal and rainforest areas. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree known for its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>
<p>Acmena caudata is also occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena caudata was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and as a potential ornamental plant in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with warm climates, such as parts of Australia, where it has been cultivated for its aesthetic value. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in some natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its beauty, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological impacts.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited to areas where it is intentionally planted.</p>
