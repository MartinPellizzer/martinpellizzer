                <h1>Acorus calamus var. calamus</h1>
<p>Acorus calamus var. calamus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It has long, sword-shaped leaves that are often aromatic and have a distinct, spicy scent. The plant produces yellow-green flowers in summer, which are typically arranged in a spadix enclosed by a spathe. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds.</p>
<p>Sweet flag is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies for centuries.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. calamus has long, sword-shaped leaves that are usually broad at the base and taper to a point, arranged in a spiral along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, light green to yellowish bark that has a slight fibrous texture. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in a spadix surrounded by a leaf-like bract, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, berry-like structure that disperses seeds through water and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming dense underground networks that help the plant spread and anchor itself in wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. calamus is a wetland plant native to eastern North America, particularly the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is now found across much of the northern hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and northern Africa, often introduced through human activity. This species thrives in moist, shallow waters such as ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters, in temperate climates.</p>
<p>While not currently listed as endangered, its spread in non-native regions can sometimes lead to ecological concerns.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. calamus is a hardy aquatic plant commonly found in wetlands and marshes, known for its aromatic rhizomes and sword-like foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by planting rhizome cuttings in shallow water or moist soil. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid conditions and blooming in late summer with yellowish-green flowers.</p>
<p>It prefers rich, loamy soil with good drainage and requires consistent moisture, though it can tolerate occasional drying. Fertilization with a balanced aquatic plant fertilizer during the growing season helps promote healthy growth, while pruning dead leaves in late fall keeps the plant tidy.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs in damp conditions, and it pairs well with other water plants like cattails and iris for natural wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. calamus is a wetland plant that provides food and shelter for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and beetles due to its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a natural filtration system, helping to improve water quality in wetland ecosystems. Its dense growth also serves as erosion control by stabilizing soil along water edges.</p>
<p>Additionally, it functions as a companion plant for other wetland species by creating a diverse and supportive habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. calamus is a versatile plant with a wide range of uses and applications.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, it is used to flavor foods and beverages, particularly in traditional cuisines for its aromatic rhizomes. Medically, it has been utilized for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties in herbal remedies. Industrially, its rhizomes are harvested for commercial use in perfumes, soaps, and other products.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in various traditions and is often associated with purification and protection.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. calamus has several popular cultivars, including 'Aureus' and 'Variegatus', which are prized for their striking foliage patterns.</p>
<p>While this variety is not widely hybridized, it has been used in crosses with other Acorus species to create ornamental hybrids with enhanced traits. These hybrids often exhibit improved hardiness and variegation, making them popular in aquatic and bog gardens. The horticultural importance of Acorus calamus var. calamus lies in its adaptability to wet environments and its aesthetic value in water feature landscaping.</p>
<p>Its cultivation contributes to the diversity of plants used in ecological restoration and ornamental horticulture.</p>
