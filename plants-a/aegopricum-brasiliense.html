                <h1>Aegopricum brasiliense</h1>
<p>Aegopricum brasiliense, commonly known as the Brazilian sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, edible seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegopricum brasiliense has leaves that are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, arranged alternately along the stem, and they are typically green with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, slender, and somewhat hairy, with a greenish color that may turn reddish at the base, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases small seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, fertile soil.</p>
