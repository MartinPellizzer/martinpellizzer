                    <h1>Actinanthella</h1>
<p>Actinanthella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, waxy, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, slender stem and lacks true leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Actinanthella is considered critically endangered and is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
