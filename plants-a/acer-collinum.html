                        <h1>Acer collinum</h1>
<p>Acer collinum, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows at high elevations, often in subalpine or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The tree has a distinctive appearance with its slender trunk and delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Acer collinum plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer collinum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is found in states such as Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or hilly terrain. It is commonly found in mixed hardwood forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its distinctive red or orange fall foliage, making it a notable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer collinum was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as an ornamental tree due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It has since spread into natural areas, often outcompeting native species for resources. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats have led to its classification as an invasive species in several regions. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and mitigate its effects on native biodiversity.</p>
