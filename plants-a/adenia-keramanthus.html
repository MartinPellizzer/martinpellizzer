                <h1>Adenia keramanthus</h1>
<p>Adenia keramanthus, commonly known as the white belladonna vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its striking white flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia keramanthus has heart-shaped leaves that are glossy green, arranged alternately along the stem, and measure approximately 10-15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips. Its flowers are large, showy, and consist of five pinkish-white petals with a yellow center, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and help the plant store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia keramanthus is primarily native to Kenya, Somalia, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the eastern and southern regions of these countries. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical areas with moist, well-drained soils. Adenia keramanthus is commonly found in forested and coastal regions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of East Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia keramanthus was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along coastal areas where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is known for its striking yellow flowers and its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions. It has become naturalized in some parts of the country, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is important to manage its spread to prevent it from outcompeting local flora.</p>
