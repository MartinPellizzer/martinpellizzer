                    <h1>Asplenium scolopendrium var. americanum</h1>
<p>Asplenium scolopendrium var. americanum, commonly known as the American hart's tongue fern, is a perennial fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in rows. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the European hart's tongue fern but has distinct adaptations to its North American habitat.</p>
