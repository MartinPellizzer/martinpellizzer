<p>Adesmia bicolora, commonly known as the two-colored legume, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is known for its nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits.</p>
<p>Adesmia bicolora is often found in dry, open habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia bicolora has small, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 1 to 3 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes slightly rough with age, growing in a creeping or ascending pattern.

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia bicolora is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Argentina Northwest, Argentina South, Brazil South, Chile Central, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in regions with temperate climates and diverse ecosystems. It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Adesmia bicolora is often associated with well-drained soils and can be found in both coastal and inland areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptability to various environmental conditions across these South American regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia bicolora was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Its introduction has led to its spread in native grasslands and shrublands.</p>
<p>It is often considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
