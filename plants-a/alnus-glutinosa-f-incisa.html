<p>Alnus glutinosa f. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that hang in clusters, typical of the Betulaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands.</p>
<p>The bark is typically smooth and grey, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment.</p>
