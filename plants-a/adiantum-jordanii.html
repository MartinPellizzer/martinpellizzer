                <h1>Adiantum jordanii</h1>
<p>Adiantum jordanii, commonly known as the Jordan fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or wooded areas. Its rhizomes are short and produce a dense carpet of foliage.</p>
<p>Adiantum jordanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum jordanii has fern-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a delicate, leathery texture. The plant has a creeping stem with a smooth, light brown bark that grows along the ground, often forming dense mats. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, with no showy petals, and relies on wind pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a cluster of spores, and the plant disperses its spores through wind, rather than producing seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum jordanii is primarily native to California, Mexico Northwest, and Oregon.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in rocky and open habitats throughout these regions. It thrives in areas with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. The plant is often seen growing in coastal and mountainous environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the varied climates and geographies of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum jordanii was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This fern is known for its delicate, lace-like fronds and has become naturalized in many parts of its range. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
