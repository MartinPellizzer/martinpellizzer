<p>Anabasis articulata subsp.</p>
<p>oropediorum, commonly known as the coastal arrowweed, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments. It typically grows in coastal dunes and salt marshes, where it tolerates high salt concentrations and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, branching stems with small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are yellowish-green and appear in clusters, contributing to its role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological resilience and is often used in coastal restoration projects.</p>
