                <h1>Achillea atrata var. vulgaris</h1>
<p>Achillea atrata var. vulgaris, commonly known as common yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels. The plant is characterized by its aromatic foliage and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal and ornamental uses.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects its historical association with healing and its widespread presence in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea atrata var. vulgaris has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, dark green with a grayish-blue underside, and arranged in a rosette formation, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hollow, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a growth pattern that is mostly herbaceous. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea atrata var. vulgaris is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>While it was historically widespread, its current distribution is more limited, with populations primarily concentrated in southern France, Italy, and Spain. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and open woodlands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, habitat loss and urbanization have led to concerns for its long-term conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea atrata var. vulgaris is a hardy perennial known for its dark purple foliage and yellow flowers, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, going through active growth in spring and blooming in early summer before entering dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It requires regular watering during dry periods but is drought-tolerant once established, and benefits from a light application of balanced fertilizer in spring. Pruning back faded flowers encourages continuous blooming, while common pests like aphids and diseases such as powdery mildew can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea atrata var. vulgaris is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and promoting a healthy ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea atrata var. vulgaris is a flowering plant known for its various uses and applications across different domains.</p>
