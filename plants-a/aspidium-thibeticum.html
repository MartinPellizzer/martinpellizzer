<p>Aspidium thibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium thibeticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage.</p>
