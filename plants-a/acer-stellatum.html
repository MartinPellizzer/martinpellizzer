                <h1>Acer stellatum</h1>
<p>Acer stellatum, commonly known as the starred maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves, which are typically five-lobed and arranged in a radial pattern. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more furrowed with age.</p>
<p>Acer stellatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to temperate climates with well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer stellatum has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a distinctive star-like shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5-10 cm in diameter, displaying a vibrant green color in summer that turns yellow or red in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in racemes, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to their light weight and gliding structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its native habitat in dry, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer stellatum is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across parts of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. This species thrives in temperate climates, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils within forested areas. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acer stellatum is listed as a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and over-collection for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer stellatum is a small deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seed propagation being the most common method. The growth cycle of Acer stellatum includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or fungal infections, and it benefits from companion planting with lavender or marigold to deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer stellatum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, star-shaped flowers. Its dense growth habit acts as a companion plant, offering erosion control in disturbed soils. The plant also serves as a habitat for insects and contributes to biodiversity in forest edges and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its ecological role supports a wide range of organisms, enhancing the overall health of the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer stellatum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value, often cultivated for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique star-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its wood has been historically used in small-scale crafts and furniture due to its fine grain and workability. In traditional medicine, various parts of the plant have been used to treat ailments such as skin conditions and respiratory issues. It holds cultural significance in some regions, symbolizing resilience and renewal due to its ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer stellatum plays a role in both ecological and aesthetic contexts, contributing to biodiversity and landscape beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer stellatum has several popular cultivars such as 'Atrosanguineum', known for its striking red leaves, and 'Variegatum', which features variegated foliage.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, resulting in cultivars like 'Crimson King' and 'Emerald Queen', which exhibit enhanced ornamental traits. These hybrids and cultivars are highly valued in horticulture for their vibrant fall colors and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>Due to their aesthetic appeal, Acer stellatum and its variants play a significant role in landscape design and garden aesthetics.</p>
