                    <h1>Andropogon halepensis var. sudanensis</h1>
<p>Andropogon halepensis var. sudanensis, commonly known as Sudan grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage crop in regions with limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil structure.</p>
