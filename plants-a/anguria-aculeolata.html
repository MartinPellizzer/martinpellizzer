<p>Anguria aculeolata, commonly known as the spiny cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features tendrils and spiny stems, which help it climb and deter herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into elongated, spiny fruits resembling cucumbers. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The fruit is edible when mature, though its spines make harvesting challenging.</p>
