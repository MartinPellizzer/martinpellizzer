<p>Athrotaxis × laxifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pencil pine, is a hybrid conifer native to Tasmania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly twisted. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in coastal and montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
