                    <h1>Agrostis lachnantha</h1>
<p>Agrostis lachnantha, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in agricultural and horticultural settings.</p>
<p>Agrostis lachnantha is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
