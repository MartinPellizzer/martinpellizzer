                    <h1>Adiantopsis orbignyana</h1>
<p>Adiantopsis orbignyana, commonly known as the orbignyana maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of the more well-known maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its fronds are usually bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in its survival by attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Adiantopsis orbignyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
