<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that often form dense, compact clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
