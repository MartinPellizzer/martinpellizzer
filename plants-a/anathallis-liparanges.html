                    <h1>Anathallis liparanges</h1>
<p>Anathallis liparanges, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It primarily inhabits the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Ficus*, in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using its green stems. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and unique ecological role, it plays an important part in the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>
