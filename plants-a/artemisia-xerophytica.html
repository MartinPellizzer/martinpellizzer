                    <h1>Artemisia xerophytica</h1>
<p>Artemisia xerophytica, commonly known as the desert wormwood, is a hardy shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of small, aromatic leaves that are densely packed and covered in fine hairs. This plant is highly drought-tolerant, adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Its compact growth habit and resilience make it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control in dry landscapes.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
