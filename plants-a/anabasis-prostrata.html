                    <h1>Anabasis prostrata</h1>
<p>Anabasis prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Anabasis prostrata is often found in saline soils and is used in rehabilitation of degraded lands due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
