                        <h1>Achillea cartilaginea</h1>
<p>Achillea cartilaginea, commonly known as the alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>Achillea cartilaginea is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>
