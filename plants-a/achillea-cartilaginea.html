                <h1>Achillea cartilaginea</h1>
<p>Achillea cartilaginea, commonly known as the alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>Achillea cartilaginea is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea cartilaginea has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in fine white hairs, and has a light green to grayish hue, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish-white composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, allowing wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's rocky or arid habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea cartilaginea is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as southern France, Spain, and the Iberian Peninsula, with some populations extending into northern Africa. It thrives in dry, rocky environments, often growing on slopes and cliffs. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea cartilaginea is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea cartilaginea is a hardy perennial plant known for its fragrant, fern-like foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seeds sown in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in the summer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization should be done sparingly in early spring, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and repel pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea cartilaginea is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering shelter and foraging opportunities. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its dense root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Achillea cartilaginea also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea cartilaginea is a perennial plant known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat ailments such as wounds, inflammation, and digestive issues.</p>
<p>It has also been utilized in culinary applications, with its leaves and flowers sometimes incorporated into herbal teas and local dishes. Industrially, it contributes to the production of essential oils and natural dyes, supporting regional economies.
