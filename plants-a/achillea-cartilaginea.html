                <h1>Achillea cartilaginea</h1>
<p>Achillea cartilaginea, commonly known as the alpine yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to alpine and rocky environments. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic, medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its common name honors the legendary Greek hero Achilles, who was said to have used it to treat wounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea cartilaginea has narrow, gray-green leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and measure approximately 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, greenish-gray bark that grows in a single, branching pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish-white composite heads with ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea cartilaginea is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly the Pyrenees and the Alps.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Spain, France, Italy, and Switzerland, where it thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. This plant prefers rocky soils and open, sunny areas, often growing in meadows and grasslands. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Achillea cartilaginea is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea cartilaginea is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds indoors in late winter. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in late spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions, and it pairs well with other drought-tolerant plants like lavender or sedum in a rock garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea cartilaginea is a hardy perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various insects and small wildlife.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its yellow flowers, supporting local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and promoting a healthy ecosystem.</p>
