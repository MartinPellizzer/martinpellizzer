<p>Antennaria pulvinata subsp.</p>
<p>albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered pearlwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal areas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid and coastal habitats. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>
