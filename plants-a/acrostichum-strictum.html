                <h1>Acrostichum strictum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum strictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf brake, is a tropical fern native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that grow in a compact, upright form. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically divided into pairs of pinnae, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum strictum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically 1 to 2 meters long, with lanceolate-shaped leaflets arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green and have a smooth texture, though they may vary in color depending on light exposure. The stem is sturdy and upright, with a rough, fibrous bark that provides structural support for the plant. Acrostichum strictum produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically yellow or green, which bloom during the spring and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread effectively in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum strictum is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in coastal areas and mangrove swamps. This plant is also native to parts of the Caribbean, including the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas. It prefers well-drained, sandy soils and is often associated with brackish or saltwater environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can also be found in some regions of southern Florida and the southern United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum strictum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mangrove swamps, salt marshes, and other brackish water environments. This plant has been introduced to various parts of the world, including the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and parts of the Pacific Islands. Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as land development and the spread of invasive species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can thrive in both freshwater and saline conditions.</p>
