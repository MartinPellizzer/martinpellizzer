                <h1>Actinostemon australis</h1>
<p>Actinostemon australis, commonly known as the Australian starwort, is a perennial herb native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and wetland habitats. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually pink or purple and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Actinostemon australis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemon australis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon australis is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and on sandy soils. It is commonly associated with fynbos vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon australis was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>It was first brought there in the early 20th century by horticulturists who appreciated its aesthetic value. Despite its beauty, it has since become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native species in wetland and riparian habitats. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to propagate through both seeds and rhizomes, making it difficult to control.</p>
<p>Today, it is considered a noxious weed in several regions of New Zealand, prompting efforts to manage its distribution.</p>
