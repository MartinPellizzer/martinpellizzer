                <h1>Adicea tetraphylla</h1>
<p>Adicea tetraphylla, commonly known as the four-leafed arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a distinct four-leaf appearance. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive yellowish-green color.</p>
<p>Adicea tetraphylla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea tetraphylla has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a light green color and a slightly hairy texture, growing upright and branching at the base. It produces small, clustered flowers with four petals, typically pink or white, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea tetraphylla is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often associated with disturbed sites and can be found in both natural and cultivated environments.</p>
<p>Adicea tetraphylla plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea tetraphylla was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments where it can thrive in partial shade to full sun. This plant spreads primarily through its rhizomes, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
<p>However, it is also used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
