                <h1>Adenandra bolusii</h1>
<p>Adenandra bolusii, commonly known as the Bolus adenandra, is a shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae, which is known for its diverse and often showy floral structures. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in dense inflorescences, and are usually white or pale yellow in color.</p>
<p>Adenandra bolusii is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra bolusii has elliptical, glossy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in umbels, blooming in early spring and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra bolusii is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of South Africa, specifically in the areas of the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of KwaZulu-Natal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops, mountainous terrain, and along coastal cliffs. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with fynbos vegetation. It is particularly common in the areas around Table Mountain and the Cederberg.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra bolusii was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal fynbos vegetation and is often cultivated in gardens due to its ornamental value. The plant is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It is also occasionally grown in other parts of the world with similar climatic conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in its introduced range.</p>
