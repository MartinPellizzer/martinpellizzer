                    <h1>Aspidium serra</h1>
<p>Aspidium serra, commonly known as the serrated wood fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly found in regions like Japan, China, and Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while also storing nutrients.</p>
<p>Aspidium serra is valued both for its ornamental appearance and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
