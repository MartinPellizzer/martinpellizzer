                    <h1>Anil ehrenbergiana</h1>
<p>Anil ehrenbergiana, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, spiny, globular stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise muted appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Anil ehrenbergiana is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
