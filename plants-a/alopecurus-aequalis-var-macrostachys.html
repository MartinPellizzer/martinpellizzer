<p>Alopecurus aequalis var. macrostachys, commonly known as the tall meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and grassy slopes. The plant features slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
