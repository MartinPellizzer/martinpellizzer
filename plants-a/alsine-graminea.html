                <h1>Alsine graminea</h1>
<p>Alsine graminea, commonly known as slender sandgrass, is a low-growing annual grass native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats or tufts, with thin, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers in spikelets, which are clustered along the stems. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions.</p>
<p>Alsine graminea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment.</p>
