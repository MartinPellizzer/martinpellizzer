                <h1>Adinobotrys erianthus</h1>
<p>Adinobotrys erianthus, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, yellowish fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in tropical climates and is often found in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinobotrys erianthus has alternate, simple, elliptic leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and slightly woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, clustered yellow-green flowers with five petals and stamens, blooming from February to April, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses due to its attractive foliage and resilience. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is expanding due to human activity and climate change.</p>
