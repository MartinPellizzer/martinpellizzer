                <h1>Aconitum plicatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum plicatum, commonly known as the pleated monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pleated, hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant has dark green, doubly serrated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Aconitum plicatum grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and prefers well-drained, moist soils in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle or ingest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum plicatum has leaves that are broadly ovate to rhombic in shape, with a distinctive pleated or plicated appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spike-like inflorescences, with showy petals and a spurred structure, blooming in late summer and pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum plicatum is primarily native to Czechia-Slovakia, Germany, and Poland.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in mountainous regions and alpine meadows within these countries. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Aconitum plicatum is known for its striking purple or blue flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to temperate and subalpine climates in Central Europe.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum plicatum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking purple flowers. The plant has adapted well to temperate climates and can thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it has also become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact in non-native environments.</p>
