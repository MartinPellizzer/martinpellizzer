                <h1>Adicea venulosa</h1>
<p>Adicea venulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ceropegia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that are typically tubular in shape. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Adicea venulosa is a perennial herb that is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea venulosa has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea venulosa is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along riverbanks. This species is also known to occur in parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and Malaysia. Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adicea venulosa plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by supporting local biodiversity and contributing to soil stability.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea venulosa was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, allowing it to spread rapidly in these locations. Its ability to produce numerous seeds and tolerate various environmental conditions contributes to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major threat in most regions where it has been introduced.</p>
