                    <h1>Athyrium filix-femina var. commune</h1>
<p>Athyrium filix-femina var. commune, commonly known as the lady fern, is a deciduous fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and arching in growth habit. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
