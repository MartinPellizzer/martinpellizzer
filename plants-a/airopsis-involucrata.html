                    <h1>Airopsis involucrata</h1>
<p>Airopsis involucrata, commonly known as the red seaweed, is a species of red algae belonging to the family Rhodomelaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching, filamentous thallus that typically grows in dense mats on rocky substrates in marine environments. The plant exhibits a vibrant red coloration due to the presence of phycoerythrin, a pigment that aids in light absorption for photosynthesis. Airopsis involucrata is often found in temperate to tropical coastal regions, where it plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>Its structure and reproductive features make it an important subject in studies of marine botany and ecological dynamics.</p>
