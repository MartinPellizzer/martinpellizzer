<p>Actinodaphne gullavara, commonly known as the Ceylon cinnamon tree, is a member of the樟科 (Lauraceae) family.</p>
<p>It is native to the wet tropical forests of Sri Lanka and is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces dark brown, woody fruits that contain kidney-shaped seeds. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine and for their essential oils.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne gullavara has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. It produces small, fragrant flowers with three petals and three sepals, typically blooming during the dry season, and is pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, round drupe that splits to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne gullavara is a rare tropical tree native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is currently found only in the southeastern part of the island, specifically in the rainforests of the Masoala Peninsula. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall and rich, well-drained soils. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Actinodaphne gullavara is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne gullavara is a tropical evergreen tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle of Actinodaphne gullavara is relatively slow, with significant growth occurring during the rainy season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree are recommended. Common pests include scale insects and mealybugs, while diseases are relatively rare but can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-tolerant plants can enhance its growth in a mixed garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne gullavara is a vital plant in its native ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its fragrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and birds, which help in the reproductive process of the plant. It also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native flora in the surrounding area. Additionally, its dense root system helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil along riverbanks and forest edges.</p>
<p>Overall, Actinodaphne gullavara plays a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance and biodiversity.</p>
