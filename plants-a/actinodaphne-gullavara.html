                <h1>Actinodaphne gullavara</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne gullavara, commonly known as the Keralan camphor tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are typically followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Its bark and leaves contain essential oils, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in dense forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne gullavara has simple, alternate, elliptic or ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, clustered in panicles, and bloom during the wet season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, smooth, yellow drupe that disperses primarily by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, forming a dense network near the surface to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne gullavara is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forests, often in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. This plant thrives in warm, moist climates and is typically associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of Malaysia and possibly on the island of Sumatra.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a regionally important species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne gullavara was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in lowland and hill forest environments, often growing in secondary vegetation or along forest edges. This plant is commonly found in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities like cultivation and trade.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an important component of the local flora in many regions where it has been introduced.</p>
