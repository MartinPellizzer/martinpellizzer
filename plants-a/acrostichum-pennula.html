                <h1>Acrostichum pennula</h1>
<p>Acrostichum pennula, commonly known as the giant reed or giant grass, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 6 meters. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the base of the stems.</p>
<p>Acrostichum pennula is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pennula has large, feather-like leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with each leaf blade being long and narrow, typically reaching up to 1 meter in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture. The stem is sturdy and erect, with a rough, fibrous bark that becomes darker with age. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the summer and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses its seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and help stabilize the plant in moist environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pennula is primarily native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove forests and saltwater swamps. This plant is well adapted to saline conditions and can tolerate periodic flooding. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the presence of brackish water ecosystems in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pennula was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as landscaping and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, riverbanks, and wetlands. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded environments. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
