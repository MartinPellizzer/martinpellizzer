                    <h1>Acrozus</h1>
<p>Acrozus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender roots and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its botanical name, Acrozus, reflects its unique position as a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
