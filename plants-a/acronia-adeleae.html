                <h1>Acronia adeleae</h1>
<p>Acronia adeleae, commonly known as the Adele's acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth texture, and it produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acronia adeleae is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia adeleae has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia adeleae is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest understories. This plant thrives in areas with rich, well-drained soil and moderate humidity. It is particularly abundant in the states of Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia.</p>
<p>Acronia adeleae is often associated with hardwood forests and is a component of the diverse flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia adeleae was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and abandoned lots.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in the eastern United States, particularly in states like North Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee. Its introduction has led to its spread into native ecosystems, sometimes competing with local flora.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments if left unchecked.</p>
