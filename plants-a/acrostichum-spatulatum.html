                <h1>Acrostichum spatulatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum spatulatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf hibiscus, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a smooth surface. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent red stamens, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum spatulatum has leaves that are broad, ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a waxy, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is smooth and somewhat succulent, with a pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, relying on wind pollination.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a three-winged samara, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum spatulatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and tidal forests. This plant is well adapted to saline and brackish water conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. It is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends to parts of Oceania, including Australia and New Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum spatulatum was mainly introduced to the coastal areas of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands and along the shores of estuaries. This plant is known for its ability to tolerate brackish water conditions. It has been reported in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
