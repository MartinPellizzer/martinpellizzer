                    <h1>Androcymbium greuterocymbium</h1>
<p>Androcymbium greuterocymbium, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble delicate cups. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
