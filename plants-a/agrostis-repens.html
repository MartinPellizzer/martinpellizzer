                    <h1>Agrostis repens</h1>
<p>Agrostis repens, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, slightly rolled leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is widely used in turfgrass and ecological restoration projects.</p>
