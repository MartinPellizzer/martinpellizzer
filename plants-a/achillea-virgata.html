                <h1>Achillea virgata</h1>
<p>Achillea virgata, commonly known as the slender yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea virgata has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, with a gray-green color and a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, somewhat branched, and have a smooth, greenish-brown bark. The flowers are clustered in flat-topped umbels, consisting of small, white to pale yellow petals, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea virgata is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, France, Italy, and parts of the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats like hillsides, meadows, and coastal areas. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with dry, sunny environments. It is also known to occur in parts of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to its adaptability to well-drained soils and its ability to tolerate drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea virgata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns over its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
