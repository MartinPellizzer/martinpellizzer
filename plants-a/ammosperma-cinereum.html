                <h1>Ammosperma cinereum</h1>
<p>Ammosperma cinereum, commonly known as the gray sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, often growing in clusters. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in sandy soils, and it is well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Ammosperma cinereum plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
