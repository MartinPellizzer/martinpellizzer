                <h1>Aechmea purpurea</h1>
<p>Aechmea purpurea, commonly known as the purple fountain plant, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Aechmea purpurea is popular as a decorative plant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively low maintenance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea purpurea has leaves that are strap-shaped, arranged in a rosette, and can grow up to 60 cm in length, with a dark green to blue-gray color and a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, often hidden stem with a fibrous, light green to brown bark that grows from the base of the rosette. Its flowers are borne in a dense, spike-like inflorescence, with purple to pink bracts and yellowish-green petals, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry containing numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by birds eating the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its epiphytic or terrestrial habitat.</p>
