                <h1>Acourtia acevedoi</h1>
<p>Acourtia acevedoi, commonly known as the Acevedo's acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs. Acourtia acevedoi is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia acevedoi has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a dull green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly woody, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth when young and becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia acevedoi is primarily native to the coastal regions of central and southern California, specifically within the California Floristic Province.</p>
<p>It is found in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, often in areas with maritime climates. This plant is endemic to a small geographic area, indicating a limited natural range. It thrives in environments with mild, temperate conditions and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the California coast.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia acevedoi was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often associated with human activity.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions and disturbed sites such as roadsides and agricultural fields. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and can tolerate saline conditions. Its introduction has led to its spread along the Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
