                    <h1>Alnus fruticosa var. kamtschatica</h1>
<p>Alnus fruticosa var. kamtschatica, commonly known as the Kamtschatskan alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold climates of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its alternate, simple, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges, riverbanks, and tundra regions.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer plant in ecological succession.</p>
