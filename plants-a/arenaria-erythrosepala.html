<p>Arenaria erythrosepala, commonly known as the red-sepal sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, with prominent red sepals that distinguish it from other species. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its leaves are typically succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Arenaria erythrosepala plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates.</p>
