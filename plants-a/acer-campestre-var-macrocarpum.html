                <h1>Acer campestre var. macrocarpum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-seeded field maple, is a variant of the field maple native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters. The leaves are palmately lobed, with coarsely toothed margins, and they turn vibrant yellow in autumn. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while the fruits are distinctive, large samaras with elongated wings.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges and open areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. macrocarpum has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with smooth, gray-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in sandy or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. macrocarpum is a variant of the field maple native to central and eastern Europe, particularly in countries such as Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has been restricted due to habitat loss, and it is now primarily found in isolated populations in its native range. This plant thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands or along stream banks. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat degradation, it is considered a species of conservation concern, with some populations classified as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. macrocarpum is a compact, slow-growing maple known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or layering, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this plant is relatively slow, with steady growth in spring and early summer, and dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to shape the plant and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and provide mutual benefits in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. macrocarpum is a versatile shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in hedgerows, enhancing the overall structure and stability of the ecosystem. The plant also contributes to erosion control due to its extensive root system, which helps bind soil together.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving soil quality and supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. macrocarpum is a lesser-known variant of the horse chestnut tree, primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its seeds have been occasionally explored for their potential nutritional value. In traditional medicine, the bark and leaves may have been used for their astringent properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to the timber industry, providing durable wood for furniture and construction.</p>
<p>Culturally, it serves as a symbol of resilience and beauty in certain regions, often planted in parks and public spaces for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. macrocarpum has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated in horticulture, such as 'Crimson King' and 'Orientale', known for their striking autumn color and compact growth.</p>
<p>It is also frequently used as a parent in hybridization efforts, leading to the development of various hybrids that exhibit enhanced ornamental traits. These hybrids often combine the hardiness of Acer campestre with the vibrant foliage of other maple species. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it holds significant horticultural importance in landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids contribute to the diversity of maple trees available for cultivation in different climates.</p>
