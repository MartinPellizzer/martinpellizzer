                <h1>Acridocarpus adenophorus</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus adenophorus, commonly known as the hairy nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. The seeds are used in traditional medicine and are also valued for their essential oils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus adenophorus has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes rougher with age, growing in a bushy pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus adenophorus is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the dry and humid forests of the island, particularly in the eastern and southern regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in secondary growth areas. The species is adapted to the unique climate and ecological conditions of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is part of the country's rich biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus adenophorus was mainly introduced to control the spread of invasive weeds in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in agroforestry systems to improve soil fertility and provide shade for crops. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it an effective natural barrier against erosion.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive if not managed properly, posing a risk to native ecosystems.</p>
