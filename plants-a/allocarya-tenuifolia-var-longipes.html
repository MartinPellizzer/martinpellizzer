                    <h1>Allocarya tenuifolia var. longipes</h1>
<p>Allocarya tenuifolia var. longipes, commonly known as the slenderleaf alpine grass, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, greenish-yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable indicator species for alpine ecosystems.</p>
