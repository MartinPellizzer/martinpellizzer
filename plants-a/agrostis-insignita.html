                    <h1>Agrostis insignita</h1>
<p>Agrostis insignita, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Agrostis insignita is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover.</p>
