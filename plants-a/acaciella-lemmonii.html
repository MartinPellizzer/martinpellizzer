<p>Acaciella lemmonii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, pinnate leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Acaciella lemmonii is often found in rocky soils and is a common component of desert ecosystems.</p>
