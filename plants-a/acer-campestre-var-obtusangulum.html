                <h1>Acer campestre var. obtusangulum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre var. obtusangulum, commonly known as the blunt-angled maple, is a variant of the common maple, characterized by its distinct leaf morphology.</p>
<p>It features rounded, heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin, which contribute to its ornamental value in gardens. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its flowers are inconspicuous, but the showy red or orange samaras add visual interest in the fall.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. obtusangulum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a rounded tip, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5–10 cm in length; the leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in cymes, blooming in late spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. obtusangulum is a variant of the European maple, native to southern Europe, particularly spanning from the Iberian Peninsula to the Balkans.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to scattered populations in southern Spain and parts of southern France. It thrives in open, sunny environments such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and woodland edges. This species typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, generally below 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. obtusangulum is a compact, ornamental maple known for its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. This variety grows slowly, reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a healthy garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. obtusangulum is a small shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, yellowish flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in woodland edges, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, especially in disturbed or marginal habitats.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological health of its environment by supporting a variety of organisms throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. obtusangulum is a lesser-known variant of the maple tree that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in traditional herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in industrial applications, its wood may be utilized for small crafts or local timber production. Culturally, it contributes to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems and is sometimes symbolically associated with resilience in regional folklore. Its role in ecological systems supports wildlife and soil stability, making it important for environmental conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications are more ecological and symbolic than commercial.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. obtusangulum has several popular cultivars that are valued for their ornamental qualities, such as 'Erich Hiebl' and 'Tarnovská', which showcase striking foliage and compact growth.</p>
<p>This variety is also used in hybridization to create new maple species with enhanced traits, including improved cold hardiness and unique leaf patterns. Hybrids involving Acer campestre var. obtusangulum often combine the vigor of the parent species with decorative features, making them desirable in horticulture. Its horticultural importance lies in its adaptability to various garden conditions and its role in expanding the diversity of maple plants available to landscapers and gardeners.</p>
<p>Overall, it contributes significantly to the aesthetic and functional value of cultivated landscapes.</p>
