                        <h1>Acer campestre var. obtusangulum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre var. obtusangulum, commonly known as the blunt-angled hedge maple, is a compact, slow-growing deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, dense foliage and small, palmately lobed leaves that are typically broader and more rounded than those of the typical *Acer campestre*. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly valued for its compact form and ability to tolerate urban environments.</p>
