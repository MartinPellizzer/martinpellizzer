                    <h1>Aconitum bartletii var. fukutomei</h1>
<p>Aconitum bartletii var. fukutomei, commonly known as the Fukutomea monkshood, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to Japan, this variant is characterized by its tall, spire-like stems and large, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant features palmate leaves with deeply cut lobes, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical collections.</p>
