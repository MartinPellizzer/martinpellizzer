                    <h1>Armeria berlengensis var. tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Armeria berlengensis var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps to reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in coastal gardens.</p>
