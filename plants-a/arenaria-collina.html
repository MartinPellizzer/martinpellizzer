<p>Arenaria collina, commonly known as sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Arenaria collina plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
