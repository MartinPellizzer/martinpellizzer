                    <h1>Atriplex nitens f. integrifolia</h1>
<p>Atriplex nitens f. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth saltbush, is a variant of the saltbush species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant is a shrub or small tree, often growing in saline soils and coastal areas. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain single seeds.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for revegetation projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
