<p>Arceuthobium hondurense subsp.</p>
<p>hawksworthii, commonly known as the Honduran dwarf broomrape, is a holoparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and lack of true roots.</p>
<p>This species typically attaches itself to the roots of host plants, such as certain species of grasses and shrubs. It is native to Central America, particularly Honduras, and is adapted to grow in dry, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in its ecosystem.</p>
