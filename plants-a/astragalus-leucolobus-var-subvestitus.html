                    <h1>Astragalus leucolobus var. subvestitus</h1>
<p>Astragalus leucolobus var. subvestitus, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its low-growing habit and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
