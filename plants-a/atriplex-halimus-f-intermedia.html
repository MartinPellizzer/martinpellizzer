                    <h1>Atriplex halimus f. intermedia</h1>
<p>Atriplex halimus f. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, fleshy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically appearing in spring. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
