                <h1>Aechmea basilateralis</h1>
<p>Aechmea basilateralis, commonly known as the pink pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vivid pink bracts that resemble a pineapple. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light.</p>
<p>Aechmea basilateralis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea basilateralis has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, strap-like, and dark green with a waxy coating, arranged in a tight spiral around the central rosette.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, with a short, stout base that is covered in a dense, fibrous sheath resembling bark. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom during the summer months, and it is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed berry that matures to a reddish color, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption and wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding environment.</p>
