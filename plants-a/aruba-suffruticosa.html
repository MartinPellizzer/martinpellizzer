                    <h1>Aruba suffruticosa</h1>
<p>Aruba suffruticosa, commonly known as the Aruba rock fig, is a small shrub native to the island of Aruba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in arid conditions and is well adapted to the rocky, coastal terrain of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
