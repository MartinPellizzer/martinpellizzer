                    <h1>Apera tenuiflora</h1>
<p>Apera tenuiflora, commonly known as slender oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, dunes, and roadside areas. The plant has thin, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Apera tenuiflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
