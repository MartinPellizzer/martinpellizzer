<p>Aizoon filiforme, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into three-lobed, reddish-brown berries. Aizoon filiforme is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is often found in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
