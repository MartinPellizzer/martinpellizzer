                <h1>Achras zapota var. zapotilla</h1>
<p>Achras zapota var. zapotilla, commonly known as the chicle tree, is a tropical plant native to Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with smooth, greyish-brown bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing a sticky, latex-rich pulp. Its latex, known as chicle, was historically used in the production of chewing gum.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in local medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras zapota var. zapotilla has compound, pinnate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with elliptical to ovate leaflets that are usually green and have a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is typically straight and cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is dark brown to black in color. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers with a simple structure, blooming during the summer months and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a spiny, globose capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in tropical and subtropical environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras zapota var. zapotilla is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, including countries like Cuba, Mexico, and Guatemala.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed in tropical regions across the Americas, Africa, and Southeast Asia due to human introduction and cultivation. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils in lowland tropical forests and along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to about 600 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat faces threats from deforestation and habitat loss, leading to a moderate conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras zapota var. zapotilla is a tropical plant known for its rapid growth and ornamental value, often cultivated for its large, edible fruit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a long growth cycle, reaching maturity in 3â€“5 years, and thrives in warm, humid climates with a distinct wet season.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining, fertile soil and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to remove dead or diseased wood are essential for healthy growth. Common pests include aphids and mealybugs, while diseases like anthracnose can affect the fruit.</p>
<p>Companion planting with legumes or marigolds can help deter pests and improve soil fertility.</p>
