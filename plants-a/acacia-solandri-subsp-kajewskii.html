<p>Acacia solandri subsp.</p>
<p>kajewskii, commonly known as the Kajewskii acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are typical of the Acacia genus. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a feature that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and inland regions of southern Australia.</p>
