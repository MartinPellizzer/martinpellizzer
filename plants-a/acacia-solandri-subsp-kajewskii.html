                        <h1>Acacia solandri subsp. kajewskii</h1>
<p>Acacia solandri subsp.</p>
<p>kajewskii, commonly known as the Kajewskii acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are typical of the Acacia genus. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a feature that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and inland regions of southern Australia.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia solandri subsp.</p>
<p>kajewskii is primarily native to eastern Australia, including parts of Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. It is commonly found in dry to semi-arid regions, often in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is typically associated with open woodlands and shrublands, where it forms dense thickets. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia solandri subsp.</p>
<p>kajewskii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>This subspecies is now considered invasive in some regions of New Zealand, outcompeting native vegetation. It thrives in a variety of soil types and can grow in both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets have led to concerns over its ecological impact.</p>
