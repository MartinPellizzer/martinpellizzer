                        <h1>Acacia umbrosa</h1>
<p>Acacia umbrosa, commonly known as the black wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by flat, ribbed pods containing seeds. Acacia umbrosa is adapted to a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia umbrosa is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils and rocky outcrops, often in savanna and shrubland habitats. This species is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acacia umbrosa is also known for its distinctive, umbrella-shaped foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia umbrosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>It was also introduced for erosion control because of its dense root system and rapid growth rate. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Despite its ecological impact, it remains popular in horticulture for its aesthetic value.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread and minimize its negative effects on biodiversity.</p>
