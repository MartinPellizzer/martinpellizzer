                    <h1>Aristolochia refracta</h1>
<p>Aristolochia refracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a pipe, hence its common name. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and a strong, aromatic scent. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>The genus Aristolochia contains many species with similar morphological features, though A. refracta is notable for its unique floral structure and medicinal historical use.</p>
