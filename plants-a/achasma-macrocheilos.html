                <h1>Achasma macrocheilos</h1>
<p>Achasma macrocheilos, commonly known as the large-lipped achasma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Gesneriaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a large, fleshy lower lip. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a glossy surface.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achasma macrocheilos has broad, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanging throughout the plant's life. Its flowers are showy, with large, spurred petals and a bright yellow color, blooming in late spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achasma macrocheilos is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, primarily in countries like Peru and Bolivia.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to some botanical gardens and conservation centers outside its natural habitat. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous areas. It is usually found at altitudes between 3,000 and 4,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achasma macrocheilos is considered endangered, with conservation efforts focused on protecting its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achasma macrocheilos is a rare and unique orchid species known for its striking, oversized petals and vibrant colors.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed germination or by dividing the rhizomes, although the former is more challenging due to its slow growth. The plant follows a seasonal growth cycle, with active growth during spring and summer, followed by a dormant period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining, slightly acidic soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced orchid fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning of dead or diseased foliage helps maintain its health. Common pests include aphids and mealybugs, while fungal diseases can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or other shade-loving plants can create a suitable microclimate for its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achasma macrocheilos is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its showy flowers attract a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat. It acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through mutualistic relationships. Additionally, its dense growth can help with erosion control by stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>The plant also plays a role in supporting local food webs by offering shelter and sustenance to various animal species.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achasma macrocheilos is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses and applications.</p>
<p>It is not widely used in culinary traditions, as it lacks notable flavor or nutritional value. In medicinal contexts, there is minimal evidence of its use in traditional or modern medicine. Industrially, it does not contribute significantly to economic sectors.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds little symbolic importance in most societies, though it may be of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achasma macrocheilos has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their unique floral characteristics.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Ballerina' and 'Mona Lisa,' which are known for their striking coloration and compact growth habits. Hybrids of Achasma macrocheilos are often developed to enhance flower size, color intensity, and disease resistance. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability to various growing conditions and their use in ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Their beauty and versatility make them a valuable addition to both commercial and home gardens.</p>
