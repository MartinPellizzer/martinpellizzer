                <h1>Achasma macrocheilos</h1>
<p>Achasma macrocheilos, commonly known as the large-lipped achasma, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achasma macrocheilos has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and slightly hairy, with a light brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are large, showy, and trumpet-shaped, with a vibrant orange color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achasma macrocheilos is a flowering plant native to the highland regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in similar tropical and subtropical regions, though its presence has become more limited due to habitat loss. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests and montane rainforests. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to deforestation and habitat degradation, Achasma macrocheilos is considered endangered, with its conservation status listed as vulnerable by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achasma macrocheilos is a unique and ornamental plant known for its striking flowers and delicate foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with division being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Achasma macrocheilos is typically seasonal, with active growth during spring and summer, followed by a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization during the growing season with a balanced fertilizer helps promote healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourage blooming. It is relatively resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lavender or rosemary can help deter pests and improve air circulation.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achasma macrocheilos is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its vibrant flowers attract a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on it for sustenance. It acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. Additionally, its extensive root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>The plant also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and maintaining the health of local habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achasma macrocheilos is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may have potential in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Its role in the ecosystem includes supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity. Culturally, it may hold symbolic meaning in local communities, though specific traditions are not well documented.</p>
<p>Due to its limited commercial use, its economic impact remains minimal, though further research could reveal more about its potential applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achasma macrocheilos has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Alba' with its white petals and 'Rubra' known for its deep red hue. Hybrids of Achasma macrocheilos are often developed to enhance flower size, color, and disease resistance. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in gardens.</p>
<p>They are widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for their striking floral displays.</p>
