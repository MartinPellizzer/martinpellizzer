                    <h1>Amianthium nuttallii</h1>
<p>Amianthium nuttallii, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, often reddish stems that grow up to 2 feet tall, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in wetland environments, contributing to ecological balance.</p>
<p>Amianthium nuttallii is also valued for its role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar for adult butterflies and habitat for their larvae.</p>
