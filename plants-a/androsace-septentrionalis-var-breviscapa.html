                    <h1>Androsace septentrionalis var. breviscapa</h1>
<p>Androsace septentrionalis var. breviscapa, commonly known as the northern sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in disturbed alpine habitats.</p>
