                <h1>Aconitum tuberosum</h1>
<p>Aconitum tuberosum, commonly known as the meadow aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes at the top of the stem. Its roots are tuberous and have been historically used in traditional medicine, though the plant is highly toxic.</p>
<p>Aconitum tuberosum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum tuberosum has large, compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with deeply lobed blades that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat hairy, with a rough, bark-like texture that is typically dark brown or grayish in color. Its flowers are blue to purple in color, forming dense spike-like clusters, and they bloom in late summer, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and serve as storage organs, enabling the plant to survive harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tuberosum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central and East Asia, including parts of China, Tibet, and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. This plant is also occasionally found in the Caucasus and southern Russia. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often associated with forested slopes.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes high-altitude regions where it has adapted to harsh climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tuberosum was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade and ornamental plant cultivation.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and naturalized areas in the eastern and central United States. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.</p>
<p>Its presence has raised concerns about its potential to spread into native ecosystems.</p>
