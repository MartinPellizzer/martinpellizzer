<p>Aconitum tuberosum, commonly known as the meadow aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes at the top of the stem. Its roots are tuberous and have been historically used in traditional medicine, though the plant is highly toxic.</p>
<p>Aconitum tuberosum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
