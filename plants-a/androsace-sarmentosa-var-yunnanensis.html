                    <h1>Androsace sarmentosa var. yunnanensis</h1>
<p>Androsace sarmentosa var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a compact growth habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or alpine soils. Its leaves are usually succulent and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
