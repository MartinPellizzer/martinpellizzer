<p>Arrhenatherum elatius var. palustre, commonly known as reed canarygrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist to water-saturated soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant produces tall, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
