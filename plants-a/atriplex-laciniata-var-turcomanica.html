                    <h1>Atriplex laciniata var. turcomanica</h1>
<p>Atriplex laciniata var. turcomanica, commonly known as the Turkestan saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It features succulent, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and saline soils across Central Asia.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in high-salt environments makes it an important species for ecological restoration in degraded landscapes.</p>
