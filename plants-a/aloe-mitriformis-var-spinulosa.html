                    <h1>Aloe mitriformis var. spinulosa</h1>
<p>Aloe mitriformis var. spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features tall, narrow, upright stems covered in dense, spiny bracts that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters at the stem tips, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are fleshy and somewhat triangular, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
