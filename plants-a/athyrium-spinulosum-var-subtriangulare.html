                    <h1>Athyrium spinulosum var. subtriangulare</h1>
<p>Athyrium spinulosum var. subtriangulare, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese painted fern, is a variant of the evergreen fern characterized by its finely divided, triangular-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>The plant features a compact, upright growth habit with dark green, glossy foliage that has a delicate, almost lace-like appearance. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant. The fronds are typically adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori, which are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is relatively low maintenance and well-suited for USDA hardiness zones 6 to 9.</p>
