<p>Atriplex patula var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves with serrated edges that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert environments.</p>
<p>Atriplex patula var. serrata is often used for erosion control and as forage for wildlife and livestock.</p>
