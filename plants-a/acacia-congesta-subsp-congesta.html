                <h1>Acacia congesta subsp. congesta</h1>
<p>Acacia congesta subsp.</p>
<p>congesta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, feathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia congesta subsp.</p>
<p>congesta has compound leaves that are bipinnately arranged, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically greyish-brown in color.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow and clustered in spherical or cylindrical heads, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a flattened pod that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their small size and light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to access water in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia congesta subsp.</p>
<p>congesta is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, primarily found in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. Its current distribution includes parts of the Kalahari Desert and surrounding areas, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>This species typically grows in open woodlands, grasslands, and rocky outcrops, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level. Acacia congesta subsp.</p>
<p>congesta is listed as of least concern by the IUCN, indicating that it is not currently facing significant threats to its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia congesta subsp.</p>
<p>congesta is a hardy, fast-growing leguminous shrub native to southern Africa, commonly used for its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for optimal germination. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few years, making it suitable for quick landscaping projects.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape and promote bushiness are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants or drought-tolerant species can enhance its growth and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
