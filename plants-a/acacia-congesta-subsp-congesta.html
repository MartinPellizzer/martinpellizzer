                        <h1>Acacia congesta subsp. congesta</h1>
<p>Acacia congesta subsp.</p>
<p>congesta, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, typically during the autumn and winter months. It thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, showing some tolerance to salt spray.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of coastal vegetation.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia congesta subsp.</p>
<p>congesta belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their simple structures and spore reproduction.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by their complex floral structures. Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have compound leaves and flowers with a distinctive structure, including legumes. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive foliage and often symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia congesta, a particular subspecies known for its dense foliage and ecological importance in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia congesta subsp.</p>
<p>congesta is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the state.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland areas. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>The plant is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia congesta subsp.</p>
<p>congesta was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region. It has been widely planted for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in coastal and Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>The plant is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage. It has also been introduced to other parts of southern Africa, including Namibia and southern Botswana.</p>
<p>However, its spread outside of cultivated areas is limited compared to other acacia species.</p>
