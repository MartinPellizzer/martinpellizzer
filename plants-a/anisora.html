                    <h1>Anisora</h1>
<p>Anisora, commonly known as the "bluebells of the desert," is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant produces delicate, blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Anisora thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its foliage consists of finely divided leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
