                    <h1>Arenaria petiolata</h1>
<p>Arenaria petiolata, commonly known as the petioled sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in branched inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Arenaria petiolata is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
