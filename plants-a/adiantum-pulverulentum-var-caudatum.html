<p>Adiantum pulverulentum var. caudatum, commonly known as the feather tassel fern, is a delicate fern species native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feathery fronds that are often adorned with a powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a graceful, cascading habit that makes it popular in ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
