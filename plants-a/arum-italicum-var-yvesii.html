<p>Arum italicum var. yvesii, commonly known as the Yves' arum, is a striking ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Corsica.</p>
<p>It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green with a velvety texture, and its most distinctive characteristic is its showy, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a hooded spathe. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by specific insects, such as flies and beetles. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic foliage and unique floral structure.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes grown in controlled environments to prevent it from becoming invasive.</p>
