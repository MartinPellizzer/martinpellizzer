                    <h1>Asplenium foresiacum subvar. paucilobatum</h1>
<p>Asplenium foresiacum subvar. paucilobatum, commonly known as the few-lobed rock fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, leathery fronds that are often adorned with small, tooth-like lobes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in low-light conditions. Its spore-producing structures, or sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically unique species.</p>
