The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested habitats. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a leathery texture, and it produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
