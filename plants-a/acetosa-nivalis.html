                    <h1>Acetosa nivalis</h1>
<p>Acetosa nivalis, commonly known as the snow buttercup, is a flowering plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, low-growing stems. The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in rocky or snowy habitats. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acetosa nivalis plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems and is adapted to survive harsh winter conditions.</p>
