<p>Artemisia lewisii, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Artemisia lewisii is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems and plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
