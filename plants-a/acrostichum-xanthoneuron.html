                <h1>Acrostichum xanthoneuron</h1>
<p>Acrostichum xanthoneuron, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish tinge on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The golden fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum xanthoneuron has large, elongated, lanceolate leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are sturdy and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, clustered yellow-green flowers with three petals and three sepals, blooming in the summer months and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are lightweight with a papery coating.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum xanthoneuron is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and mangrove swamps where it thrives in moist, saline environments. This plant is particularly associated with the Bahamas, Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to tropical and subtropical regions with specific hydrological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum xanthoneuron was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and warm climates, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments and is often found near freshwater bodies such as rivers, lakes, and marshes. This plant is commonly spread through water currents and can establish itself in disturbed or flooded soils. Its introduction has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
