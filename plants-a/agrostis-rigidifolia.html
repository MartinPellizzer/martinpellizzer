<p>Agrostis rigidifolia, commonly known as rigid bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
