<p>Aspidium macrodon, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. Its fronds are divided into numerous small, serrated segments that help in photosynthesis and gas exchange.</p>
