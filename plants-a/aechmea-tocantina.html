                <h1>Aechmea tocantina</h1>
<p>Aechmea tocantina, commonly known as the Tocantins pineapple plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with brightly colored bracts that range from red to yellow. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Aechmea tocantina is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea tocantina has rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a compact spiral, with a dark green color and a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, instead having a short, thick, and fibrous base that resembles a pseudostem. Its flowers are borne in a spike-like inflorescence, with showy purple bracts and small, tubular flowers that bloom in the dry season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that disperses seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in rocky or dry soil.</p>
