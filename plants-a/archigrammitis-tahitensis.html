<p>Archigrammitis tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian feather moss, is a rare and delicate species of moss found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hypnaceae and is characterized by its fine, feathery appearance, with slender, branching stems covered in small, elongated leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Archigrammitis tahitensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
