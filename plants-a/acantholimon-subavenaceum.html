                    <h1>Acantholimon subavenaceum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon subavenaceum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandthrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts.</p>
