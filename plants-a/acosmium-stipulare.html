                <h1>Acosmium stipulare</h1>
<p>Acosmium stipulare, commonly known as the stipule acosmium, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes a wide variety of plants with diverse morphological features. The plant is characterized by its distinctive stipules, which are leaf-like structures at the base of the leaves, often bearing a unique coloration. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically clustered in complex inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Acosmium stipulare is of interest to botanists studying plant diversity and ecological adaptation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosmium stipulare has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmium stipulare is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, tropical lowland forests and along stream banks. The plant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments with high humidity. Its distribution is limited to these specific regions within the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is not found naturally outside of this geographic range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmium stipulare was mainly introduced to control invasive species in riparian zones.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands. Its introduction has been documented in several states across the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive itself.</p>
