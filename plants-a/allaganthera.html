                    <h1>Allaganthera</h1>
<p>Allaganthera, commonly known as the mountain heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species that are native to regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. These plants are typically shrubs with small, needle-like leaves and produce clusters of bell-shaped flowers in various colors, including white, pink, and purple. Allaganthera species are adapted to grow in high-altitude environments with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are used in ecological restoration projects due to their hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in mountainous areas.</p>
