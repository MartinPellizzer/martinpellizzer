                <h1>Achyroseris albicaulis</h1>
<p>Achyroseris albicaulis, commonly known as the white-rayed desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system and drought-resistant foliage. Its white petals and yellow center create a striking contrast, making it visually distinctive.</p>
<p>It produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyroseris albicaulis has basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and green, growing from the base of the rosette. Its flowers are daisy-like, with white petals and yellow centers, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The plant produces a capsule fruit that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for absorbing moisture from the arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyroseris albicaulis is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in the states of California, Nevada, and Utah.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often seen in the Great Basin and Mojave Desert regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to specific ecological conditions that support its growth and survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyroseris albicaulis was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, typically in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with low precipitation and high temperatures, often found in disturbed or open habitats. This plant is commonly associated with sagebrush steppe and grassland communities. Its introduction is often linked to natural dispersal via wind or animal activity.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in these ecosystems.</p>
