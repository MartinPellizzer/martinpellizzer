                <h1>Acidanthera huttonii</h1>
<p>Acidanthera huttonii, commonly known as the Hutton's glory-of-the-snow, is a species of flowering plant in the family Iridaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its showy, white to pale blue flowers that resemble snowflakes. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that mature in the fall.</p>
<p>Acidanthera huttonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early spring blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidanthera huttonii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth texture and a pale greenish-brown color, growing upright and branching sparingly. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidanthera huttonii is primarily native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidanthera huttonii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there by European settlers in the 19th century as an ornamental plant. The species has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has a limited ecological impact.</p>
