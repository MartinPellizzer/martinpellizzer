                <h1>Adonanthe davidi</h1>
<p>Adonanthe davidi, commonly known as the David's hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Adonanthe davidi is relatively low-maintenance and can be grown in gardens or as a container plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonanthe davidi has alternate, elliptical leaves that are glossy green in color, with a smooth surface and a slightly wavy margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a trailing or climbing pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonanthe davidi is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these areas. The plant is commonly found in forests and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is well adapted to the cool and moist climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonanthe davidi was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates, particularly in regions where it can thrive in partial shade and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes in North America and Europe, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its delicate, fern-like foliage. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and botanical gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is cultivated.</p>
