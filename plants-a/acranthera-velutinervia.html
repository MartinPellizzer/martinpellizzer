                <h1>Acranthera velutinervia</h1>
<p>Acranthera velutinervia, commonly known as the velvet-veined acranthera, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Acranthera velutinervia is often found in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera velutinervia has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a velvety texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, and has a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, clustered in umbels, and bloom during the spring and early summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera velutinervia is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in areas with high humidity and abundant rainfall. It typically grows in the understorey of dense vegetation, where it can receive adequate light while remaining sheltered from direct sunlight. The plant is known for its distinctive velvety veins and is often associated with moist, shaded habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Borneo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera velutinervia was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, thriving in areas with moderate to high light exposure. The plant's ability to spread via seeds and vegetative propagation has contributed to its establishment in non-native regions. It is often reported in regions with a Mediterranean climate, where it can persist in dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
