<p>Athyrium × pseudoiseanum, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits a striking combination of foliage colors.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive pattern of light and dark green, creating a visually appealing appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clusters over time.</p>
<p>While it is not a true fern in the strictest sense, it is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and ease of care.</p>
