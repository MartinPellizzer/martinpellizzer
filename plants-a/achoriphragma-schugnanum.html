                <h1>Achoriphragma schugnanum</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma schugnanum, commonly known as the Schugnan rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine habitats, demonstrating a preference for well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Achoriphragma schugnanum is valued for its ornamental potential and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma schugnanum has compound leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with elongated, serrated leaflets that range from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in rocky, arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma schugnanum is primarily native to Central Asia, specifically the mountainous regions of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Tien Shan and Pamir mountain ranges, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high elevations with limited soil and moisture. It is typically associated with slopes and ridges in these arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma schugnanum was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in regions where it can thrive as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It is often found in gardens and landscaped areas due to its attractive foliage and resilience to various environmental conditions. The plant's introduction has been associated with horticultural interests rather than natural dispersal. It is not considered invasive in most regions where it is cultivated.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited to specific geographical locations where it has been intentionally planted.</p>
