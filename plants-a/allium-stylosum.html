<p>Allium stylosum, commonly known as the Stylosum garlic, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often grown for its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>The bulbs of Allium stylosum are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, though they are not as commonly cultivated for culinary use as other allium species.</p>
