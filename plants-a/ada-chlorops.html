                    <h1>Ada chlorops</h1>
<p>Ada chlorops, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant lacks traditional leaves and instead has a single, broad, waxy leaf that serves as its primary photosynthetic organ. Its flowers are pale green or white, often resembling a ghostly shape, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
