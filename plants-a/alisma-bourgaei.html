<p>Alisma bourgaei, commonly known as the Bornean water plant, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, flexible stems. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Alisma bourgaei plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
