<p>Asplenium × helii nothosubsp.</p>
<p>alberti-nieschalkii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a rare and naturally occurring hybrid between *Asplenium helii* and *Asplenium nieschalkii*. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species, with a distinctive dark green coloration and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies exhibits a unique combination of morphological traits, making it a subject of interest for botanists studying hybridization in ferns.</p>
