                <h1>Achillea capitata</h1>
<p>Achillea capitata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and fern-like, and it produces small, herbaceous stems.</p>
<p>Achillea capitata is often used in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea capitata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a gray-green color due to a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is usually clump-forming. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters called capitula, and bloom from late spring to early autumn; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea capitata is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, specifically found in parts of southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other areas, including parts of the United States and Australia, where it now grows in cultivated gardens and disturbed soils. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and coastal areas, typically at altitudes ranging from sea level to around 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and adaptability, it is not currently listed as endangered, though its spread in non-native regions can sometimes lead to ecological concerns.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea capitata is a hardy perennial plant known for its dense, flat clusters of small yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in a variety of conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rootstock in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer or early fall. The growth cycle of Achillea capitata involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in summer, and a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if not properly cared for.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea capitata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering shelter and sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, it helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Achillea capitata also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea capitata is a versatile plant known for its medicinal properties, often used in traditional medicine to treat ailments such as digestive issues and skin conditions.</p>
