                        <h1>Acacia empelioclada</h1>
<p>Acacia empelioclada, commonly known as the white thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorny branches and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that appear in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Acacia empelioclada is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry regions.</p>
<p>Its wood is hard and durable, historically used for construction and tool-making by local communities.</p>
