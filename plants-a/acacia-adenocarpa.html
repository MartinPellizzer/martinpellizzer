<p>Acacia adenocarpa, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. Acacia adenocarpa is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert animals.</p>
