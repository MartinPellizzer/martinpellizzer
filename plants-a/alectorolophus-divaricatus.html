                    <h1>Alectorolophus divaricatus</h1>
<p>Alectorolophus divaricatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow or green flowers in clusters, which are often mistaken for those of its host species. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, growing on the roots of grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
