<p>Actaea cimicifuga, commonly known as black cohosh, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and large, compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its roots are the primary part used in herbal medicine, valued for their potential hormonal and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
