                <h1>Achras zapota var. ovalis</h1>
<p>Achras zapota var. ovalis, commonly known as the red mamon tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, bark-like trunk and large, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by oval, fleshy fruits with a sweet, custard-like pulp. The fruit is edible and often used in culinary applications, while the tree is also valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates and is commonly cultivated in tropical regions for both its fruit and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras zapota var. ovalis has simple, alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically 10–20 cm long and 5–10 cm wide, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, clustered in panicles, and bloom from April to June, being wind-pollinated. The fruit is a spiny, spherical capsule that splits open to release smooth, oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras zapota var. ovalis is a variant of the chicozapote tree native to Central America, specifically found in countries like Mexico, Belize, and parts of northern South America.</p>
<p>It is now cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including parts of Florida and the Caribbean. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers a warm, humid environment. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters, in tropical rainforests or secondary growth areas.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat faces threats from deforestation and habitat loss, leading to a vulnerable conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras zapota var. ovalis is a fast-growing, evergreen tree native to tropical regions, known for its ornamental value and edible fruit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or air layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle includes a rapid initial growth phase followed by a period of fruit development, typically during the rainy season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining, fertile soil and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and pruning to shape the tree and remove diseased branches are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or fungal infections, which can be managed with proper care and companion planting with marigolds or neem trees.</p>
