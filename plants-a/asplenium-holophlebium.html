<p>Asplenium holophlebium, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are deeply divided into narrow segments. The fronds are typically arranged in a loose, upright clump, and the plant prefers moist, shaded environments. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the underground stems producing new shoots and roots.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
