                        <h1>Abelicea crenata</h1>
<p>Abelicea crenata, commonly known as the crested abelicea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Abelicea crenata typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelicea crenata is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and rocky habitats along the shores of countries such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with dune environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelicea crenata was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean basin.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils along the shorelines, often found in areas with moderate to high salinity. The plant is known for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion, making it valuable for ecological restoration projects. Its introduction has been largely intentional, as it is used to rehabilitate degraded coastal habitats.</p>
<p>However, its spread has sometimes led to concerns about competition with native flora in certain regions.</p>
