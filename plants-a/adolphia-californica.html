                <h1>Adolphia californica</h1>
<p>Adolphia californica, commonly known as the California dodder, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fibrous root system that attaches to host plants. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it unique among the Adolphia genus.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adolphia californica has compound, alternate leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets that are usually gray-green in color and have a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with a spreading growth habit. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with five white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, rocky soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adolphia californica is primarily native to California, Mexico Northwest.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the western regions of the United States, particularly in California. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often seen in coastal areas and mountainous regions. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with periods of drought and mild winters.</p>
<p>Adolphia californica plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adolphia californica was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering structure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and cultivated areas where it is valued for its aesthetic appeal. However, it is not native to the regions where it is often planted, raising concerns about its potential to become invasive. The plant's distribution has expanded beyond its original range, leading to its presence in various ecological settings.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its introduction has sparked discussions about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
