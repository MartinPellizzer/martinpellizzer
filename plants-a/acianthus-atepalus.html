                <h1>Acianthus atepalus</h1>
<p>Acianthus atepalus, commonly known as the Atepalus orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Acianthus atepalus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a rare and exotic ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthus atepalus has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and grows upright, with a light green bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring five petal-like structures that are pinkish-white in color, blooming during the late spring to early summer months, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthus atepalus is primarily native to the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is found in the volcanic mountainous regions, particularly in the Anaga and Teno mountain ranges. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within laurel forests. It is commonly found in rocky crevices and along forest floors.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to the western part of the island, where the climate and soil conditions are most suitable.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthus atepalus was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is believed to have been introduced through human activity, possibly as an ornamental plant. The plant has established itself in native ecosystems, raising concerns about its impact on local biodiversity. Due to its invasive potential, it is now monitored as a non-native species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to certain areas of the Hawaiian Islands where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
