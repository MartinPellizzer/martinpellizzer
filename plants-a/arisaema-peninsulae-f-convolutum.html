                    <h1>Arisaema peninsulae f. convolutum</h1>
<p>Arisaema peninsulae f. convolutum, commonly known as the twisted arisaema, is a unique variant of the Arisaema genus native to specific regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally twisted leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Arisaema family, and its flowers are pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
