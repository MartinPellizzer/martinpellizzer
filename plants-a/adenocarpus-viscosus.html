                <h1>Adenocarpus viscosus</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus viscosus, commonly known as sticky burr, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which often exude a sticky substance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by distinctive, spiny, viscid fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in grassland or shrubland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus viscosus has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a sticky, glandular layer, and has a brownish-gray bark with a rough, fissured texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensively branched, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus viscosus is primarily native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is found in various habitats across these islands, including coastal areas and rocky terrains. The plant is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates typical of the region. It plays a role in the local ecosystem and is part of the native flora of the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to this specific geographic area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus viscosus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common invader in agricultural and urban landscapes. The plant's ability to spread through seeds carried by wind and water contributes to its rapid colonization of new areas. Its sticky leaves and prolific seed production enhance its invasive potential in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological impact, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine due to its bioactive compounds.</p>
