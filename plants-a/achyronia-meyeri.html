                <h1>Achyronia meyeri</h1>
<p>Achyronia meyeri, commonly known as the Meyer's achyronia, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. It typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found in shaded undergrowth.</p>
<p>The leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia meyeri has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia meyeri is primarily native to the highland regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is commonly found in Andean foothills and mountainous areas. This plant is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often associated with rocky or forested habitats. Its native range is limited to specific elevations, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, Achyronia meyeri is considered a rare and endemic species in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia meyeri was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond its original cultivation areas, establishing itself in natural habitats and disturbed sites. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types have contributed to its successful establishment. However, it has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now primarily confined to the southeastern and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S.</p>
