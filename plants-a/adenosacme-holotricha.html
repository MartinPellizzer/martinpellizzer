                <h1>Adenosacme holotricha</h1>
<p>Adenosacme holotricha, commonly known as the hairy adenosacme, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are covered in fine, soft trichomes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. It is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists studying plant diversity in the Amaranthaceae family.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosacme holotricha has leaves that are ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure around 5-8 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, reddish-brown bark, and exhibits a vertical growth pattern with few branches. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosacme holotricha is primarily native to the eastern and southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland and marsh environments, particularly in the coastal regions of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. This plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils that are consistently moist. It is often associated with brackish water areas and can be found in tidal marshes and salt marshes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats along the Atlantic coast of the southeastern U.S.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosacme holotricha was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often associated with human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where competition from native vegetation is reduced. This plant is commonly found in roadsides, abandoned fields, and along railway tracks. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can outcompete native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
