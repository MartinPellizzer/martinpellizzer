<p>Acantholimon varivtzevae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada flax, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine conditions of its habitat. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
