<p>Alnus alnobetula f. laciniata, commonly known as the shredded alder, is a variant of the alder tree characterized by its finely dissected, feathery leaves.</p>
<p>This plant is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodland edges. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a distinctive, lacy appearance due to their deep lobing. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of ecological conditions.</p>
