                <h1>Adinandra luzonica</h1>
<p>Adinandra luzonica, commonly known as Luzon's adinandra, is a rare evergreen tree native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical lowland forests and is adapted to shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra luzonica has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that exudes a faint aromatic scent. Its small, fragrant white flowers are clustered in panicles, blooming during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra luzonica is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of Luzon, particularly in the forests of the Cordillera Administrative Region. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments within these tropical rainforests. It is often encountered in secondary growth areas and along riverine forests.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra luzonica was mainly introduced to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the lowland and montane forests of Luzon. This plant is typically associated with moist, shaded environments. It is often seen growing on rocky slopes and forest floors.</p>
<p>Its introduction has contributed to the biodiversity of the region's ecosystems.</p>
