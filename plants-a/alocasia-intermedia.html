                    <h1>Alocasia intermedia</h1>
<p>Alocasia intermedia, commonly known as the giant arrowroot, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 feet in length, often with a deep green color and a glossy texture. The plant produces small, white, spadix-like flowers surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Alocasia intermedia is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ability to purify indoor air.</p>
