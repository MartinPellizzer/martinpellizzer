                    <h1>Aconitum macrophyllum</h1>
<p>Aconitum macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant monkshood, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has palmately compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its roots are toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland environments.</p>
<p>Aconitum macrophyllum is valued in gardens for its dramatic appearance and ecological importance as a food source for certain pollinators.</p>
