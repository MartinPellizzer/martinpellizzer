                <h1>Aconitum macrophyllum</h1>
<p>Aconitum macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant monkshood, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has palmately compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its roots are toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland environments.</p>
<p>Aconitum macrophyllum is valued in gardens for its dramatic appearance and ecological importance as a food source for certain pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum macrophyllum has large, palmately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a broad, ovate shape and a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, with a smooth, dark brown bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple spires composed of numerous small, spurred petals, blooming in late summer and attracting pollinators like bees through nectar. The plant produces follicles that contain seeds dispersed by wind due to their light, winged structure.</p>
<p>Its roots are deep and fibrous, helping it anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum macrophyllum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats, growing in well-drained soils at high elevations. This plant thrives in areas with cool, moist conditions and is often associated with rocky slopes and meadows. Its native range includes states such as Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, as well as provinces in western Canada.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the flora in these high-altitude ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum macrophyllum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along streambanks. This plant is often cultivated for its striking blue to purple flowers and its ornamental value in gardens. However, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not properly managed.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded due to both natural dispersal and human activity.</p>
