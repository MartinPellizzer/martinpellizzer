                <h1>Acrolasia ctenophora</h1>
<p>Acrolasia ctenophora, commonly known as the featherleaf acrolasia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has narrow, feather-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. Acrolasia ctenophora is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolasia ctenophora has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a slightly serrated edge, typically measuring around 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and green in color, with a tendency to branch out at the base, forming a shrub-like growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia ctenophora is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland rainforest environments where there is ample sunlight and well-drained soil. This species is commonly found in secondary growth forests and along riverbanks, where it benefits from the moist and warm climate. It plays an important ecological role in these ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insect and animal species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become increasingly fragmented in recent years.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia ctenophora was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in regions where it has been planted for ornamental purposes. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have led to its establishment in several non-native areas. It has become a concern in some regions due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, its impact varies depending on local environmental conditions and management practices.</p>
