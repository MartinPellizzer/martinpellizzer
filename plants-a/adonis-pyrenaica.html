                <h1>Adonis pyrenaica</h1>
<p>Adonis pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis pyrenaica has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a rough texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are yellow, tubular in structure, and arranged in clusters, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis pyrenaica is primarily native to the Iberian Peninsula, southern France, and parts of northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in regions with Mediterranean climates, particularly in rocky or limestone soils. This plant thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, scrublands, and along coastal cliffs. It is commonly found in areas with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches that support its growth and survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis pyrenaica was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often along slopes or in open woodlands. This plant has been reported in several European countries, including Spain, France, and Italy. Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as gardening and land development.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in many regions where it has become established.</p>
