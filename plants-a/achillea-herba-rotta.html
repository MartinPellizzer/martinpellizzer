                <h1>Achillea herba-rotta</h1>
<p>Achillea herba-rotta, commonly known as lesser yarrow, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The plant features feathery, aromatic leaves and flat-topped clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It blooms from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its anti-inflammatory and astringent properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea herba-rotta has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a serrated edge, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, displaying a dark green color with a silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly woody at the base, with a grayish-green bark that becomes more fibrous as the plant matures. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal, and the seeds are lightweight, aiding in their spread.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, enabling the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea herba-rotta is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean area, including parts of Spain, Italy, and Greece.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has expanded due to human introduction, with populations now found in other parts of Europe and even in some regions of North America. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, meadows, and gravelly soils, often in disturbed or open habitats. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Despite its widespread presence, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas due to habitat loss and limited population sizes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea herba-rotta is a hardy perennial known for its feathery foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late fall, ensuring good germination rates. This plant prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions, and it pairs well with companion plants like lavender or yarrow.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea herba-rotta is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including beneficial insects and birds, which rely on its flowers and seeds for sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by attracting predatory insects that control pests. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the soil in disturbed or marginal areas.</p>
<p>Achillea herba-rotta also contributes to biodiversity by offering habitat and food resources to various ecological components within its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea herba-rotta is a flowering plant known for its historical and contemporary uses across various domains.</p>
<p>In medicinal applications, it has been traditionally used to treat ailments such as digestive issues and skin conditions due to its anti-inflammatory properties. Culturally, it has symbolic significance in folklore and is often associated with themes of protection and healing. While it is not commonly used in culinary contexts, its essential oils are sometimes utilized in aromatherapy and natural remedies.</p>
<p>Industrially, it contributes to the botanical trade and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea herba-rotta has several popular cultivars such as 'Aurea' and 'Paprika', which are known for their striking yellow and orange flower colors.</p>
<p>It also has hybrids that combine traits from other Achillea species, often resulting in plants with enhanced hardiness and extended blooming periods. These cultivars and hybrids are prized in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of garden conditions. They are commonly used in borders, rock gardens, and as ground cover due to their low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Their versatility and aesthetic appeal make them significant in both traditional and modern gardening practices.</p>
