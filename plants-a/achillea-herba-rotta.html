                <h1>Achillea herba-rotta</h1>
<p>Achillea herba-rotta, commonly known as lesser yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat, composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The species is known for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea herba-rotta has basal, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture and a slightly serrated margin, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, composite structures made up of ray and disc florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the seeds are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea herba-rotta is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of Europe, including southern Germany, France, and Italy, often as a result of human introduction. This species thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, typically found in alpine meadows and grasslands. It grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population, Achillea herba-rotta is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea herba-rotta is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a long growth cycle, thriving in full sun and producing its characteristic yellow flowers in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering that can lead to root rot. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea herba-rotta is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which feed on its seeds and use its foliage for cover. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its pest-repelling properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by creating a habitat and food source for various insects and animals.</p>
