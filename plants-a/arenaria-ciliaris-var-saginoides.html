                    <h1>Arenaria ciliaris var. saginoides</h1>
<p>Arenaria ciliaris var. saginoides, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with wiry stems and tiny, linear leaves that help it conserve water in harsh alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high elevations.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, arid conditions and contribute to its ecological significance in alpine ecosystems.</p>
