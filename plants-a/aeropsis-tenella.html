                    <h1>Aeropsis tenella</h1>
<p>Aeropsis tenella, commonly known as the air plant, is a unique epiphytic plant that thrives without soil by absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is native to the tropical regions of South America. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that form a cup to collect rainwater. Its ability to grow on other plants makes it an excellent choice for hanging or mounted displays.</p>
<p>Aeropsis tenella is relatively low maintenance, requiring minimal watering and indirect sunlight to flourish.</p>
