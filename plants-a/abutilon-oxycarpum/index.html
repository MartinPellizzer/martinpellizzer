                            <h1>Abutilon Oxycarpum</h1>
<p>Abutilon oxycarpum is a unique flowering plant known for its striking, lantern-shaped blooms. Native to parts of South America, it thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant features fuzzy, velvety leaves that add a soft texture to its overall appearance. Its flowers, which range in color from yellow to red, bloom in clusters and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Despite its beauty, it requires careful attention to soil and light conditions to flourish.</p>
