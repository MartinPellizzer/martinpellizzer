                <h1>Adelia rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Adelia rotundifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are often heart-shaped or rounded. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically with five petals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Adelia rotundifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia rotundifolia has rounded, waxy leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with a subtle pink tinge, blooming in late spring and attracting pollinators like bees through their nectar. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by birds feeding on the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia rotundifolia is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States, particularly found in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in Virginia and North Carolina. It thrives in moist, acidic soils within shaded forest understories, often growing in areas with high humidity. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 600 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, Adelia rotundifolia is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adelia rotundifolia is a hardy shrub known for its vibrant berries and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method. The plant follows a seasonal growth cycle, producing flowers in spring and fruiting in late summer to early fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning after fruiting helps maintain its shape and productivity.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it benefits from companion planting with herbs like thyme or sage.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adelia rotundifolia is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its dense foliage acts as shelter for small insects and birds, contributing to local biodiversity. It also functions as a companion plant, often growing alongside other native species to enhance soil health and promote ecological balance. Additionally, its deep roots help in erosion control by stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Adelia rotundifolia plays a significant role in supporting wildlife and maintaining the health of its ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adelia rotundifolia is a versatile plant known for its various uses across different fields.</p>
