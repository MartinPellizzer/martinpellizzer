                <h1>Adelia rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Adelia rotundifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Adelia rotundifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia rotundifolia has rounded, leathery leaves that are typically oval in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and display a pale pink to white color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when ripe, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia rotundifolia is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas and rocky soils, often found in regions with a temperate climate. This plant is commonly associated with the Iberian Peninsula, the Balearic Islands, and the coastal areas of Italy. It prefers sunny locations and is well adapted to withstand saline conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique characteristics, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia rotundifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, temperate climates and can spread rapidly along riverbanks and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread.</p>
