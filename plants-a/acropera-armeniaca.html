                <h1>Acropera armeniaca</h1>
<p>Acropera armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching.</p>
<p>Acropera armeniaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acropera armeniaca has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exudes a slight resinous scent. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropera armeniaca is primarily native to the Caucasus region, including parts of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>It is also found in the northern regions of Iran and Turkey. This plant typically grows in mountainous areas with rocky or gravelly soils. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows, forest edges, and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely associated with the temperate climate of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropera armeniaca was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, tubular flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Although native to the Caucasus and Anatolia, its introduction has led to its spread into non-native habitats. The plant is known for its ability to adapt to various environmental conditions, which contributes to its successful establishment.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential in some areas raises concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
