                <h1>Actinostemon parvifolius</h1>
<p>Actinostemon parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved star-stem, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers with prominent stamens, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady habitats.</p>
<p>Actinostemon parvifolius is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemon parvifolius has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that develops fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring tubular corollas with five lobes, and are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer; they are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to stabilize the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon parvifolius is primarily native to eastern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical and subtropical regions. This plant thrives in humid environments, often growing in forests or along stream banks. It is also occasionally found in parts of southern Africa, extending into South Africa.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high rainfall and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon parvifolius was mainly introduced to gardens and horticultural collections due to its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its attractive, broad leaves that can add visual interest to landscapes. This plant is typically found in USDA hardiness zones 8 through 10, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is not commonly found in the wild but is sometimes used in landscaping as a decorative plant.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is grown.</p>
