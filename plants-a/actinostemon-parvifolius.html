                    <h1>Actinostemon parvifolius</h1>
<p>Actinostemon parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved star-stem, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers with prominent stamens, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady habitats.</p>
<p>Actinostemon parvifolius is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators.</p>
