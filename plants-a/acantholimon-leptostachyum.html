                        <h1>Acantholimon leptostachyum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon leptostachyum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy flowers and succulent leaves. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon leptostachyum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Turkey.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of northern Syria and southern Ukraine. This plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters. It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with limestone and granitic substrates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon leptostachyum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high elevations, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun to partial shade and requires good air circulation. This plant is commonly found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often growing on slopes or in open meadows. It is particularly adapted to cold climates and can tolerate frost, making it suitable for alpine or subalpine zones.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and resilience in challenging conditions.</p>
