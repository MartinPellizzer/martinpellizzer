                <h1>Acroptilon obtusifolium</h1>
<p>Acroptilon obtusifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and broad, ovate leaves with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Acroptilon obtusifolium is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroptilon obtusifolium has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a blunt or rounded tip, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface. The stem is erect, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense heads, with yellow petals and a tubular structure, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroptilon obtusifolium is primarily native to central Asia, including regions such as Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and parts of China.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the steppes and semi-arid environments of these areas. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats and is often associated with grasslands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Acroptilon obtusifolium is also occasionally found in western Siberia and some parts of the Russian Federation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroptilon obtusifolium was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and degraded grasslands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate to semi-arid climates. This plant has become invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has been associated with human activities like agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its competitive nature.</p>
