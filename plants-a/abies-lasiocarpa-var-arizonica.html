                    <h1>Abies lasiocarpa var. arizonica</h1>
<p>Abies lasiocarpa var. arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona white fir, is a variant of the white fir species native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, conical crown and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of the typical white fir. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and its bark is thick, furrowed, and grayish in appearance. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often found in mountainous regions of Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>
