                <h1>Acmella alpestris</h1>
<p>Acmella alpestris, commonly known as the alpine marshmallow, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette growth habit and woolly, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in wetlands or along streams.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella alpestris has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a creeping growth pattern. Its flowers are small, yellow with a prominent central red spot, and are arranged in clusters; they bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the rocky and nutrient-poor soils of its alpine habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella alpestris is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in countries such as Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Central and South America, though it is less common outside its native range. This species thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as near threatened.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella alpestris is a flowering plant commonly grown for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with seeds requiring scarification for better germination. The growth cycle of Acmella alpestris includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmella alpestris is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain agricultural settings, helping to enhance the growth of neighboring crops. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Acmella alpestris also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health through nitrogen fixation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acmella alpestris is a flowering plant known for its diverse uses and applications across various domains.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, it is sometimes used as a spice or flavoring agent due to its distinctive taste.
