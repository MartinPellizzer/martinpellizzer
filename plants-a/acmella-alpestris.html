                <h1>Acmella alpestris</h1>
<p>Acmella alpestris, commonly known as the alpine buttonweed, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate to cold climates. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Acmella alpestris is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella alpestris has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green, slightly pubescent surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, light green bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, yellow with a prominent central white spot, arranged in dense clusters, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella alpestris is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Argentina Northwest, Bolivia, Brazil South, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the grassland and open habitats of these regions. It thrives in dry to semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils. The species is well-adapted to the climatic conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella alpestris was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is commonly found in regions with moderate rainfall. The plant is known for its bright yellow flowers and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its introduction has led to its spread in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a non-invasive species with minimal ecological impact.</p>
