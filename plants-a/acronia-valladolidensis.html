                <h1>Acronia valladolidensis</h1>
<p>Acronia valladolidensis, commonly known as the Valladolid acronia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid lowland forests.</p>
<p>Acronia valladolidensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small insects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia valladolidensis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that grows upright and branched. Its small, clustered flowers are yellow in color, consisting of four petals and a central stamen, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds by wind, with each seed being tiny and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia valladolidensis is primarily native to the Yucat√°n Peninsula in Mexico.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of this area. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils within forested habitats. Acronia valladolidensis is commonly associated with limestone substrates and can be found in both primary and secondary forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to a relatively small geographic range, making it a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia valladolidensis was mainly introduced to the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in the regions of central and southern Spain.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the late 20th century and has since become established in several habitats, including rocky slopes and open woodlands. The introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental transport via human activity, possibly through the movement of soil or plants for agricultural or ornamental purposes. Although it is not considered invasive, its distribution has expanded beyond its original range.</p>
<p>Its presence has been noted in both natural and disturbed environments, indicating a degree of adaptability to different ecological conditions.</p>
