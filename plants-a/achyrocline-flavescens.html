                <h1>Achyrocline flavescens</h1>
<p>Achyrocline flavescens, commonly known as the yellow achyrocline, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Achyrocline flavescens is also noted for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline flavescens has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 6 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and branching, with a rough, woody texture and a grayish-brown color, exhibiting a shrub-like growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring tubular structures with white to pale yellow petals, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline flavescens is primarily native to the Caribbean Islands, including the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America, such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. It is commonly associated with sandy soils and can be found in open woodlands or along the edges of forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes some islands in the Bahamas and the northern regions of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline flavescens was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is an invasive plant species that has spread across various habitats, including coastal areas and disturbed sites. The introduction is believed to have occurred through human activities, such as accidental transport on vehicles or cargo. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it poses a significant threat to local ecosystems.</p>
