                        <h1>Acaena sanguisorbae subsp. elata</h1>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae subsp.</p>
<p>elata, commonly known as the tall bristly burr, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of spiny, bristly fruits.</p>
<p>The plant produces bright red or orange berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae subsp.</p>
<p>elata is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the eastern and southern regions.</p>
<p>This subspecies grows in a variety of habitats, including forests, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with coastal and montane environments.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and diverse soil types of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae subsp.</p>
<p>elata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a potential ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit.</p>
<p>However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. Its introduction has led to competition with native plant species and degradation of habitat.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
