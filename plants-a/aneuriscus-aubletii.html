<p>Aneuriscus aubletii, commonly known as the desert candle, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features a thick, cylindrical stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically reduced to small spines, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aneuriscus aubletii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
