<p>Agrostis vulgaris var. pumila, commonly known as the cushion bentgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and short, erect stems. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and rocky areas.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments.</p>
