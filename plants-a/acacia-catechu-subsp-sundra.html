                <h1>Acacia catechu subsp. sundra</h1>
<p>Acacia catechu subsp.</p>
<p>sundra, commonly known as the Indian blackwood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its straight, dark brown to black bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, globular inflorescences. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in traditional crafts and as a source of tannins.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia catechu subsp.</p>
<p>sundra has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, oval leaflets arranged in feathery patterns, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, and they are dark green in color. The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in globular inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a flat, pod-like structure containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light, winged structures.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia catechu subsp.</p>
<p>sundra is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia, primarily found in countries such as India, Bangladesh, and parts of Indonesia. Its current distribution includes regions with moist tropical climates, particularly in the eastern and southern parts of the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high humidity and well-drained soils, often growing in lowland and hill forest areas. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia catechu subsp.</p>
<p>sundra is a hardy, fast-growing leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia, known for its rich tannin content and ecological importance. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring scarification and warm conditions for germination, while cuttings root readily in moist soil. The growth cycle includes a rapid initial growth phase followed by a slower maturation period, typically reaching maturity within 5â€“10 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil with moderate watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Regular fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from scale insects or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can enhance soil fertility and support its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia catechu subsp.</p>
<p>sundra is a vital component of tropical ecosystems, providing food and shelter for a variety of wildlife. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich flowers, while also serving as a food source for herbivores like birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plant species. Additionally, its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape. Overall, Acacia catechu subsp.</p>
<p>sundra plays a crucial ecological role in maintaining biodiversity and soil health in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acacia catechu subsp.</p>
<p>sundra is a versatile plant with a wide range of uses and applications. In culinary contexts, its bark is used to make traditional tea and as a flavoring agent.</p>
