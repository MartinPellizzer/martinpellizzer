                    <h1>Angelica sylvestris var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Angelica sylvestris var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved angelica, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, compound leaves that are narrower than those of the typical angelica. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a complex umbel, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for both its ecological role and historical uses.</p>
