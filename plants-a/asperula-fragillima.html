                    <h1>Asperula fragillima</h1>
<p>Asperula fragillima, commonly known as the fragile woodbine, is a delicate, climbing shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, twining stems with small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of white or pale pink. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and sensitivity to environmental changes, Asperula fragillima is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
