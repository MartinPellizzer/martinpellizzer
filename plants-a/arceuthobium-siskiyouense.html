                    <h1>Arceuthobium siskiyouense</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium siskiyouense, commonly known as the Siskiyou dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and has a highly reduced structure with no true leaves or stems. It is a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but primarily depends on its host for survival.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats.</p>
