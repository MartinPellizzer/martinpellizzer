                    <h1>Allohemia</h1>
<p>Allohemia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ephemeral blooms that appear only under specific environmental conditions. The flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a structure that includes cyathia, which are specialized cup-like structures containing the reproductive organs. Allohemia species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, where they have adapted to survive in harsh, dry climates.</p>
<p>Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, these plants are of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
