                    <h1>Alisma submersum</h1>
<p>Alisma submersum, commonly known as the submerged alisma, is a semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, slender leaves that are often fully submerged, with some leaves emerging above the water surface. Its small, white flowers are usually clustered in spikes and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Alisma submersum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
