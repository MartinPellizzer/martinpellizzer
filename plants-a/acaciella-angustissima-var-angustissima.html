                        <h1>Acaciella angustissima var. angustissima</h1>
<p>Acaciella angustissima var. angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf acaciella, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, angular stems covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The leaves are small, linear, and often clustered at the base of the plant, with a distinctive grayish-green color. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, which appear during the rainy season.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to withstand drought and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
