                    <h1>Avicennia oepata</h1>
<p>Avicennia oepata, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas, particularly in tidal zones where it tolerates high salinity and periodic inundation. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in catkins, and it produces buoyant, woody fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Avicennia oepata plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
