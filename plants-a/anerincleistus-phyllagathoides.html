<p>Anerincleistus phyllagathoides, commonly known as the creeping sandverbena, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features prostrate or decumbent stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are typically narrow, linear, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and often display a pale blue or white color.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor soils and extreme temperatures.</p>
