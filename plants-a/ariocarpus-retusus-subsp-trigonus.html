<p>Ariocarpus retusus subsp.</p>
<p>trigonus, commonly known as the "Cactus of the Gods," is a rare and striking cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globose shape and its unique, ribbed structure that becomes more pronounced with age.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, adding a vibrant contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts.</p>
