                <h1>Actinella glabra</h1>
<p>Actinella glabra, commonly known as the smooth actinella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its smooth, slender stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Actinella glabra is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella glabra has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, upright, and covered with fine, white hairs, growing in dense clusters. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical dispersal when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella glabra is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern and western regions of the country. This plant grows in coastal and subalpine areas, often on rocky or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with open vegetation types such as shrublands and grasslands.</p>
<p>Actinella glabra is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella glabra was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, waste grounds, and urban environments. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types contributes to its successful establishment in non-native regions. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, further research is needed to fully understand its ecological impact.</p>
