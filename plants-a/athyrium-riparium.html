                    <h1>Athyrium riparium</h1>
<p>Athyrium riparium, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often grow in a floating or submerged manner in aquatic environments. The plant typically thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to spread vegetatively through runners.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
