                        <h1>Acalypha berteroana</h1>
<p>Acalypha berteroana, commonly known as the red bower vine, is a flowering plant native to Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage.</p>
<p>Acalypha berteroana is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha berteroana belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and often having a distinct reproductive structure. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many species with specialized floral structures and often show a wide range of habitats. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse forms and often contain toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupplant," characterized by their showy inflorescences and often hairy leaves.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha berteroana, a specific type of plant within the Acalypha genus native to certain regions, known for its distinctive appearance and ecological role.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha berteroana is primarily native to Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the island's coastal areas and lowland regions. This plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often seen along the shores. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its presence is a key indicator of the unique biodiversity found in Puerto Rico's natural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha berteroana was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species there, often outcompeting native plants for resources. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as coastal areas and dry forests. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a significant ecological threat.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native biodiversity.</p>
