                <h1>Aconitum rhombifolium</h1>
<p>Aconitum rhombifolium, commonly known as the rhombic leaf aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features large, rhombic-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum rhombifolium has rhombic-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and green, with a slightly rough texture, and grows in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are blue to purple, consisting of five petals arranged in a helmet-like structure, blooming in summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases small, dark seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum rhombifolium is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of this area, including parts of Sichuan and Hubei provinces. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments within temperate forests. It is commonly associated with rocky slopes and forest understories.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this specific region in southern and central China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum rhombifolium was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue-violet flowers and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in moist woodland areas and along stream banks. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by water and wind, leading to its establishment in new habitats. It is considered invasive in some areas because of its competitive growth and ability to thrive in diverse soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and public landscapes.</p>
