                    <h1>Arsenjevia prattii</h1>
<p>Arsenjevia prattii, commonly known as the silverleaf arnheimia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray, velvety foliage that provides a unique visual contrast against its deep green stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice for coastal gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
