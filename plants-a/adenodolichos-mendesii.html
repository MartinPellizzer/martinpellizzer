                <h1>Adenodolichos mendesii</h1>
<p>Adenodolichos mendesii, commonly known as the Mediterranean horsegram, is a leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant is adapted to dry climates and is often found in rocky or arid soils. It has been traditionally used for both ornamental and agricultural purposes.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos mendesii has compound, trifoliate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly pubescent, with a light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in sandy soils and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos mendesii is primarily native to Angola.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in shrubland and grassland habitats. It plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptation to harsh conditions, it is an important component of Angola's native flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos mendesii was mainly introduced to regions with suitable climatic conditions, such as warm and semi-arid areas.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries in Africa, including South Africa, Namibia, and Kenya. The plant is typically found in disturbed habitats like roadsides, fields, and agricultural areas. Its introduction is likely due to human activities such as trade and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact and distribution patterns are still under study.</p>
