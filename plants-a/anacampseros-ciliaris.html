                    <h1>Anacampseros ciliaris</h1>
<p>Anacampseros ciliaris, commonly known as the silver leaf ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
