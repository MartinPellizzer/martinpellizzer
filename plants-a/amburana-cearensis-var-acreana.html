                    <h1>Amburana cearensis var. acreana</h1>
<p>Amburana cearensis var. acreana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
