                <h1>Acer huianum</h1>
<p>Acer huianum, commonly known as the Huian maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange autumn foliage, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it produces samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer huianum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface that turns red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub with a compact, upright form. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, which are wind-pollinated and lack showy petals. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread over short distances.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its native habitat in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer huianum is a rare deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and overharvesting. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in temperate forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. The species is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List due to its restricted range and declining population.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique and threatened plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer huianum is a striking maple tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique growth characteristics.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or softwood cuttings, with the latter offering a more reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Acer huianum includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning should be done in late winter to shape the tree and remove any diseased or dead branches. Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while diseases like powdery mildew can affect the tree, making regular monitoring essential.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving plants like ferns or hostas can enhance its ornamental appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer huianum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers. Its dense canopy acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by improving soil quality and supporting a diverse range of plant and animal life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer huianum is a species of maple tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and sap may have limited use in traditional Chinese medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. The tree contributes to the timber industry, providing wood that is valued for its strength and workability in construction and furniture-making. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in Chinese landscapes and gardens, representing resilience and beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting local biodiversity and soil stabilization also makes it important in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer huianum has several notable varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that contribute to its horticultural value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Orange Glow' and 'Laciniatum,' known for their vibrant foliage and unique leaf shapes. The species has been hybridized with other maple varieties, leading to the development of ornamental hybrids that exhibit enhanced color and growth habits. These cultivars and hybrids are highly prized in gardens and landscapes for their aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Their horticultural importance lies in their ability to add visual interest and diversity to the maple family in cultivated settings.</p>
