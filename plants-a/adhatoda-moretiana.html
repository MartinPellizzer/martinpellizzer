<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are borne in terminal clusters and are known for their fragrant, nectar-rich nature, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Adhatoda moretiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda moretiana has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, and they are typically 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these geographic areas within Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda moretiana was mainly introduced to new environments as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering characteristics.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native habitat, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.
