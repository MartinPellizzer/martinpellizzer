                        <h1>Acacia striatifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia striatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and narrow, feathery leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>Acacia striatifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia striatifolia belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their ancient evolutionary lineage. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a large group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by their complex floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that are often legumes, known for their ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees found mainly in arid regions, known for their distinctive foliage and often used for timber or as ornamental plants.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia striatifolia, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions of Africa, distinguished by its unique leaf and flower structures.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia striatifolia is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the eastern and central regions of the state. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of Queensland.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high sunlight exposure.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia striatifolia was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This plant is often used for windbreaks and soil stabilization due to its hardy nature. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ability to provide shade and habitat for local wildlife.</p>
