<p>Asplenium mertensianum, commonly known as the maidenhair spleenwort, is a fern species belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often resemble the shape of a fern's traditional appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rock surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Asplenium mertensianum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in controlled environments.</p>
