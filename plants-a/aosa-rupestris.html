                    <h1>Aosa rupestris</h1>
<p>Aosa rupestris, commonly known as the rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a whitish powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rocky gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
