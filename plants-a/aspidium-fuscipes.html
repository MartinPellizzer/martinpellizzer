<p>Aspidium fuscipes, commonly known as the brown-footed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green with a rusty-brown underside. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged or floating surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Aspidium fuscipes plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its natural filtration properties.</p>
