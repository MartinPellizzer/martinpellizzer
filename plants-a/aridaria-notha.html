<p>Aridaria notha, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in low-water conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Aridaria notha is often used in xeriscaping due to its resilience and ornamental value in dry climates.</p>
