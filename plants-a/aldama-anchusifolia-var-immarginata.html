                    <h1>Aldama anchusifolia var. immarginata</h1>
<p>Aldama anchusifolia var. immarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Aldama, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
