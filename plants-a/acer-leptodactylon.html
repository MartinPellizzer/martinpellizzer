                <h1>Acer leptodactylon</h1>
<p>Acer leptodactylon, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite branching pattern and palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 20–30 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer leptodactylon has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically 3–5 inches long and 2–4 inches wide, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, exhibiting a vibrant green color in summer and turning yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed, which is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer leptodactylon is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, specifically in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Vietnam and southern Korea, though its current distribution is limited. This plant thrives in humid, temperate forests and is often found in shaded, moist environments. It typically grows at elevations between 800 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Acer leptodactylon is considered a species of concern and is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer leptodactylon is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. The growth cycle includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by new growth in spring and active development throughout the summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer supports healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and promote vigor. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other shrubs or trees can enhance its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer leptodactylon is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining soil moisture and supporting the overall health of the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer leptodactylon is a species of maple native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological role.</p>
