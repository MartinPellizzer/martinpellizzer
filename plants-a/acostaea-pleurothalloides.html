                    <h1>Acostaea pleurothalloides</h1>
<p>Acostaea pleurothalloides, commonly known as the broadleaf water fern, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its broad, floating leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure on the water surface.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that allow it to efficiently capture sunlight for photosynthesis. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including small, floating fruits, contribute to its dispersal and survival in aquatic environments.</p>
