<p>Armeriastrum hausknechtii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
