<p>Alliaria hiernii, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its pungent odor due to glucosinolates. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are hairy and emit a garlic-like scent when crushed. It produces small white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by triangular seed pods that release winged seeds.</p>
<p>Alliaria hiernii is an invasive species in North America, where it outcompetes native plants and disrupts forest ecosystems.</p>
