<p>Azorella selago var. compacta, commonly known as the cushion azorella, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Andes mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water and withstand extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Azorella selago var. compacta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine organisms.</p>
