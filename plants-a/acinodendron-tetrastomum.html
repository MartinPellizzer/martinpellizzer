                <h1>Acinodendron tetrastomum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron tetrastomum, commonly known as the four-stoma acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a smooth texture.</p>
<p>Acinodendron tetrastomum is often found in humid, shaded environments within forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tetrastomum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green, glossy upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicle-like inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tetrastomum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded undergrowth. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and well-drained soil. It is typically associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tetrastomum was mainly introduced to specific regions in Africa, particularly in countries like Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It was introduced as part of ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in degraded soils. The plant is commonly found in savanna and woodland areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its introduction has also been linked to traditional land-use practices by local communities.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about potential impacts on native plant species and ecosystem balance.</p>
