<p>Aira flexuosa var. purpurea, commonly known as purple false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and distinctive purple-tinged foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive coloration and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps.</p>
