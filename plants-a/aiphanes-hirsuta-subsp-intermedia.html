<p>Aiphanes hirsuta subsp.</p>
<p>intermedia, commonly known as the hairy papyrus, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the wetlands and coastal areas of South America. It features a rosette of narrow, stiff, hairy leaves that are typically green to grayish in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist environments.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to tolerate saline and waterlogged soils, making it an important component of coastal and marsh ecosystems.</p>
