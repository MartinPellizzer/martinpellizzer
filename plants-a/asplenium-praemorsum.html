<p>Asplenium praemorsum, commonly known as the death's-head fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clustered fronds that are lanceolate and often have a distinctive dark brown or black midrib. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium praemorsum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
