                <h1>Acrostichum eggersii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a rough texture.</p>
<p>The flowers, which bloom in shades of yellow and orange, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum eggersii has large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically broad and dark green, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually elongated with a waxy surface and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The stem is sturdy and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dark, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, which is dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum eggersii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in lowland rainforests. It is also present in parts of the Caribbean, including the islands of Hispaniola and Cuba.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes riverbanks and swampy areas where it can access abundant moisture.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum eggersii was mainly introduced to coastal areas of the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is commonly found in dunes and salt marshes. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system and salt tolerance. It has been introduced as part of restoration projects to stabilize vulnerable coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to competition with native vegetation in certain habitats.</p>
