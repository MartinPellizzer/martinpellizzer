                <h1>Achyronia sarcodes</h1>
<p>Achyronia sarcodes, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, purple or pink petals and a central cone-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Achyronia sarcodes produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia sarcodes has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth green upper surface and a pale underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia sarcodes is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky habitats such as chaparral and coastal scrub environments. This plant is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and mild coastal climates. It is often associated with disturbed sites and can be seen growing along roadsides and in open woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia sarcodes was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks. This plant has been reported in several states including Washington, Oregon, and California. It is often mistaken for native species due to its similar appearance.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to outcompete native flora.</p>
