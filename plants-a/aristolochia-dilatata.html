<p>Aristolochia dilatata, commonly known as the broadleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and produces striking, pipe-shaped flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant is known for its aromatic, somewhat unpleasant odor, which is produced by the flowers to attract specific pollinators. Its morphology is adapted for climbing, with tendrils that help it ascend supports.</p>
<p>The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique floral structure.</p>
