                    <h1>Arabis ciliata f. incana</h1>
<p>Arabis ciliata f. incana, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are finely toothed and covered with soft, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with low light conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
