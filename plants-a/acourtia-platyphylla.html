                <h1>Acourtia platyphylla</h1>
<p>Acourtia platyphylla, commonly known as the flatleaf acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically broad and flat, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Acourtia platyphylla is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia platyphylla has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more cracked with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellow petals and a greenish center, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia platyphylla is primarily native to Mexico Northeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the northeastern regions of Mexico, specifically in the states of Nuevo Le√≥n, Tamaulipas, and parts of Coahuila. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in limestone hills and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific areas within northeastern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia platyphylla was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant is often spread through human activities, such as transportation and land development. It has been reported in several protected areas, raising concerns about its impact on native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
