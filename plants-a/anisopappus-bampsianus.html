<p>Anisopappus bampsianus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer, followed by fluffy, parachute-like seeds for wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Anisopappus bampsianus is well-suited to dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
