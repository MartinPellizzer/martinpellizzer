<p>Ammannia rotala, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, arranged in clusters. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water, while its leaves float on the surface.</p>
<p>Ammannia rotala is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, where it can form dense mats.</p>
