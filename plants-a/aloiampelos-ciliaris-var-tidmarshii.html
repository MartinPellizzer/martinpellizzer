                    <h1>Aloiampelos ciliaris var. tidmarshii</h1>
<p>Aloiampelos ciliaris var. tidmarshii, commonly known as the Tidmarsh's silver hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fine, silver-hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small, inconspicuous white to pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. It is drought-tolerant and well-adapted to coastal conditions, making it a hardy ornamental choice.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its silvery foliage and ability to form dense, low mats.</p>
