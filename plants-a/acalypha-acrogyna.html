                        <h1>Acalypha acrogyna</h1>
<p>Acalypha acrogyna, commonly known as the silky senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with a soft, silky texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Acalypha acrogyna is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha acrogyna belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many species with specialized leaf and flower structures. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse morphologies and some toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupplant," characterized by their showy flowers and often hairy leaves.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha acrogyna, a specific plant within the genus Acalypha, known for its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha acrogyna is primarily native to Cameroon, Congo, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Sudan-South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>Its native distribution spans much of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha acrogyna was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in disturbed areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
