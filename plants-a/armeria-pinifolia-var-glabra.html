<p>Armeria pinifolia var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth sea thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are smooth and lack the hairy texture found in other varieties. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils while providing ornamental value.</p>
