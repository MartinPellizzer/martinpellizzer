                    <h1>Arthrocnemum franzii</h1>
<p>Arthrocnemum franzii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with succulent, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adapted to attract pollinators in its extreme environment. Its leaves are typically reduced to scales, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Arthrocnemum franzii plays a vital ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for desert fauna.</p>
