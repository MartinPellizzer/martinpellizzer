                <h1>Achillea millefolium subsp. tanacetifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium subsp.</p>
<p>tanacetifolia, commonly known as the yarrow or medicinal yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features basal rosettes of finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces flat-topped clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and adaptable garden plant.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it valuable for both ornamental gardening and traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium subsp.</p>
<p>tanacetifolia has leaves that are finely dissected, resembling a feather, with a bright green color and a serrated edge, arranged alternately along the stem. The stems are upright, somewhat hairy, and have a grayish-green color, growing in a clump-forming pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite blooms, arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from early summer to late summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant to stabilize in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium subsp.</p>
<p>tanacetifolia is a perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia, particularly in regions such as the Balkans, Turkey, and parts of the Mediterranean. It is now widely distributed across temperate regions, including parts of North America and Australia, where it has been introduced as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>This species thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 2,500 meters, depending on the region.</p>
<p>The conservation status of this subspecies is generally stable, though local populations may be threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium subsp.</p>
<p>tanacetifolia is a hardy perennial known for its finely divided, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers. It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a long growth cycle, typically blooming in late spring to early summer and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, echinacea, or yarrow enhances its ornamental value and supports beneficial insect activity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium subsp.</p>
<p>tanacetifolia is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen for pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while also offering shelter and food for various small wildlife species. It attracts a wide range of pollinators due to its bright yellow flowers and fragrant scent.</p>
<p>This plant acts as an effective companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its pest-repelling properties. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological balance by supporting biodiversity in natural and cultivated landscapes.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium subsp.</p>
<p>tanacetifolia is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications. In culinary contexts, it is sometimes used as a flavoring agent, particularly in herbal teas and infusions.</p>
