<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthanthus ayacuchensis is primarily native to the Peruvian Andes, specifically in the region of Ayacucho.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 3,000 and 4,500 meters above sea level. This plant is commonly found in rocky and arid habitats, often growing on slopes or in crevices. It is adapted to the cool and dry climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthanthus ayacuchensis was mainly introduced to regions with a temperate climate and well-drained soils, where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
