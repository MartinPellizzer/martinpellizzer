<p>Atriplex subopposita, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It produces greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences.</p>
<p>Atriplex subopposita is well adapted to saline soils and is often found in coastal and inland saltbush habitats.</p>
