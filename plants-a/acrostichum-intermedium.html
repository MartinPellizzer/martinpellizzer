                <h1>Acrostichum intermedium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate brake, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum intermedium plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum intermedium has large, elongated leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green color and a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and upright, with a rough, fibrous bark that is usually brown in color, and it exhibits a rhizomatous growth pattern. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish-yellow flowers with separate male and female parts, blooming during the dry season, and it is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, fleshy drupe that disperses its seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and anchor itself in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum intermedium is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. This plant thrives in humid environments with rich, moist soil. It is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends from the Caribbean to northern Argentina.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum intermedium was mainly introduced to coastal areas and wetlands in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as dunes, marshes, and along riverbanks. This plant is often associated with sandy or gravelly soils and can tolerate salt spray. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered environments.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
