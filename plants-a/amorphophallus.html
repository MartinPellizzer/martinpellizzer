<p>Amorphophallus, commonly known as the titan arum, is a tropical plant native to Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, striking inflorescence that resembles a giant, curling phallus, hence its common name. The plant produces a strong, unpleasant odor similar to rotting flesh, which attracts pollinators like flies and beetles. Its underground stem, called a tuber, is used in some cultures for food.</p>
<p>Amorphophallus is a member of the Araceae family and is known for its unique and dramatic flowering display.</p>
