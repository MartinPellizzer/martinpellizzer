                    <h1>Antennaria alpina var. typica</h1>
<p>Antennaria alpina var. typica, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with many small, clustered stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to cold, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous areas across Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
