<p>Alchemilla palmata subsp.</p>
<p>crinita, commonly known as the hairy lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps.</p>
