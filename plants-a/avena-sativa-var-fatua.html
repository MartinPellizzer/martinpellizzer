                    <h1>Avena sativa var. fatua</h1>
<p>Avena sativa var. fatua, commonly known as wild oat, is a grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, oval-shaped grains, which are typically wind-pollinated. Wild oat is often considered a weed in agricultural fields due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to cultivated oats.</p>
