<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates and is commonly found in lowland areas, along riverbanks, and in moist forests. This plant is also present in parts of Africa, particularly in East and Central regions, where it grows in similar environmental conditions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flower structures.</p>
<p>Despite its widespread distribution, it remains most prevalent in its native habitats across Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
