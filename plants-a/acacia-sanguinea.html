                        <h1>Acacia sanguinea</h1>
<p>Acacia sanguinea, commonly known as the red acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are reduced to spines in mature plants. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deep underground.</p>
<p>Acacia sanguinea is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia sanguinea is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. This species is commonly associated with dry, sunny habitats such as scrublands and maquis vegetation. It is also found in some areas of the Middle East and the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it can tolerate drought and poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia sanguinea was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in providing habitat for local wildlife. Its introduction has helped in restoring degraded lands across several countries in Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in new environments.</p>
