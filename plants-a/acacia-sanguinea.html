<p>Acacia sanguinea, commonly known as the red acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are reduced to spines in mature plants. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deep underground.</p>
<p>Acacia sanguinea is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
