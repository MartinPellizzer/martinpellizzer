                    <h1>Anthemis scopulorum</h1>
<p>Anthemis scopulorum, commonly known as the rock anthemis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in dry landscapes.</p>
