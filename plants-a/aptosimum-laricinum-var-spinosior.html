                    <h1>Aptosimum laricinum var. spinosior</h1>
<p>Aptosimum laricinum var. spinosior, commonly known as the spiny mountain ash, is a variant of the mountain ash species native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are a food source for various bird species. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization.</p>
