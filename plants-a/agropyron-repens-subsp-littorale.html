<p>Agropyron repens subsp.</p>
<p>littorale, commonly known as coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, blue-green blades that form dense, mat-like growth.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it helps stabilize the shoreline. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to tolerate salt and wind, it plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems.</p>
