                    <h1>Androsace rotundifolia var. stacheyi</h1>
<p>Androsace rotundifolia var. stacheyi, commonly known as the Stachey's cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rosette of fleshy, rounded leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, helping to retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in subalpine and alpine meadows.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its compact growth form and is valued in rock gardens for its ornamental appeal.</p>
