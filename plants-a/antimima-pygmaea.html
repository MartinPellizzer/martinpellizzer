                    <h1>Antimima pygmaea</h1>
<p>Antimima pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf antplant, is a small, carnivorous plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact size and specialized structures for trapping small insects. The plant produces a dense mat of leaves that form a rosette, creating a humid microenvironment conducive to insect capture. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, while its leaf surfaces secrete digestive enzymes.</p>
<p>Antimima pygmaea plays a role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem by breaking down captured prey.</p>
