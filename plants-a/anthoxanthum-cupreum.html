<p>Anthoxanthum cupreum, commonly known as the copper bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and slender, tufted inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Anthoxanthum cupreum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in moist habitats.</p>
