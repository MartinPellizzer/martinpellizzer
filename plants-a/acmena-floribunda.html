                <h1>Acmena floribunda</h1>
<p>Acmena floribunda, commonly known as the glossy buckthorn, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in summer. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Acmena floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its dense foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena floribunda has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in panicles, and bloom in late spring to early summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in nutrient absorption and anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena floribunda is primarily native to eastern and northeastern Australia, including regions such as New South Wales, Queensland, and the northern parts of Victoria.</p>
<p>It thrives in a variety of habitats, including rainforests, wet sclerophyll forests, and rocky outcrops. This species is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with coastal and mountainous regions where it benefits from the moist climate.</p>
<p>Acmena floribunda is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena floribunda was mainly introduced to urban and suburban landscapes for its ornamental value, particularly its showy flowers and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides in regions with a subtropical to tropical climate. The plant has been cultivated in parts of Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it has become a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impact in native habitats.</p>
