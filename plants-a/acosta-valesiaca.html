                <h1>Acosta valesiaca</h1>
<p>Acosta valesiaca, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acosta valesiaca is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta valesiaca has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a greenish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its small, white flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta valesiaca is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in the countries of Peru and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the high-altitude grasslands and mountainous areas of the Andes. This plant thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often associated with rocky soils. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is known for its distinctive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta valesiaca was mainly introduced to new habitats in South America, particularly in regions with high humidity and nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as abandoned agricultural fields and along roadsides. This plant has shown a tendency to spread rapidly, outcompeting native species in some areas. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential invasive nature.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to protect local biodiversity.</p>
