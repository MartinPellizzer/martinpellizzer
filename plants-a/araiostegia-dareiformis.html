<p>Araiostegia dareiformis, commonly known as the African rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to trees or rocks without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
