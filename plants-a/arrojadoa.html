<p>Arrojadoa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and consists of several species that are valued for their hard, dark wood. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their compound leaves and showy, often pink or red flowers. Arrojadoa species are known for their ecological importance in tropical forests and their role in traditional medicine.</p>
