                <h1>Adolphia infesta</h1>
<p>Adolphia infesta, commonly known as the African bluebell, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Its most striking feature is its clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Adolphia infesta is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adolphia infesta has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are usually green and have a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, and typically have yellow petals with a green calyx, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adolphia infesta is primarily native to Arizona, Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southwest, New Mexico, and Texas.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in desert environments. Adolphia infesta is well adapted to the hot and dry climate of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adolphia infesta was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was likely brought in during the 19th or early 20th century by European settlers who were interested in cultivating exotic species. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can grow in both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have made it a concern for conservationists in New Zealand.</p>
