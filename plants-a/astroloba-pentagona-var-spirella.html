                    <h1>Astroloba pentagona var. spirella</h1>
<p>Astroloba pentagona var. spirella, commonly known as the spiral astrophytum, is a unique cactus species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiraling stems that resemble a helix, which are covered in small, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green, ribbed structure. Its slow growth rate and compact size make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>The spiral shape of the stems is an adaptation that helps it capture sunlight efficiently in its native arid environment.</p>
