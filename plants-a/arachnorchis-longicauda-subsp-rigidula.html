<p>Arachnorchis longicauda subsp.</p>
<p>rigidula, commonly known as the rigid-tailed spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and rigidly tapered flower spike, which gives it its subspecific name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a unique, spider-like appearance that contributes to its common name.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
