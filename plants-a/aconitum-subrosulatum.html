                <h1>Aconitum subrosulatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum subrosulatum, commonly known as the alpine aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply lobed margins, and its stems are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum subrosulatum has leaves that are palmately compound, with broad, ovate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and somewhat hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing upright and branching toward the top. Its flowers are showy and blue to purple in color, consisting of five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, blooming in late summer and attracting pollinators like bees through nectar. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted for absorbing moisture from the soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum subrosulatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky soils at high elevations. This species is commonly associated with meadows and open slopes where it can receive ample sunlight. It is adapted to the cold climate and short growing season of its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum subrosulatum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue-purple flowers. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native forests and threatening local biodiversity. The plant's aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native species have led to its classification as a noxious weed.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect native ecosystems.</p>
