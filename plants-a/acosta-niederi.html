                <h1>Acosta niederi</h1>
<p>Acosta niederi, commonly known as the Nieder's acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture.</p>
<p>Acosta niederi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta niederi has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta niederi is primarily native to the eastern Andean slopes of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is found in cloud forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea level. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats in this region.</p>
<p>Acosta niederi is an important component of the local flora and is often found in association with other epiphytic plants.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta niederi was mainly introduced to the Gal√°pagos Islands.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species that has spread across various habitats within the archipelago. The plant's introduction is believed to have occurred through human activity, possibly as a result of accidental transport. It thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ecological impact, efforts are being made to control its spread.</p>
