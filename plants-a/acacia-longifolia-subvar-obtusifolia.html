                <h1>Acacia longifolia subvar. obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia longifolia subvar. obtusifolia, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically narrow and slightly hairy, and its yellow flowers that bloom in dense, spherical clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>The timber of this species is sometimes used in construction and furniture-making due to its durability.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia longifolia subvar. obtusifolia has leaves that are oblong to elliptical in shape, with a rounded or obtuse tip, arranged alternately along the stems, and typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a deep green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a smooth or slightly hairy texture. The stems are slender, woody, and have a greyish-brown bark that is smooth when young but becomes fissured with age. The flowers are yellow and grouped into spherical or cylindrical heads, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters.</p>
<p>The fruit is a woody pod containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia longifolia subvar. obtusifolia is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia, particularly in South Australia and western Victoria.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to fragmented populations along the southern coastline. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils in coastal dunes and heathlands, often in areas with high salinity and exposure to wind. This subspecies is typically found at low altitudes, usually below 50 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is classified as vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia longifolia subvar. obtusifolia is a hardy shrub native to Australia, known for its distinctive yellow flowers and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seed propagation requiring scarification to enhance germination. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few years, making it suitable for quick landscaping.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and minimal watering, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Fertilization should be limited to avoid overgrowth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or sage can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia longifolia subvar. obtusifolia is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for a variety of wildlife, including insects, birds, and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich flowers. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants. It also serves as a companion plant in degraded landscapes, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Overall, it plays a vital ecological role in maintaining biodiversity and soil health in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
