                <h1>Actinea anthemoides</h1>
<p>Actinea anthemoides, commonly known as the yellow starwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often colorful flowers. The plant features basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped with a hairy surface, and its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences. Actinea anthemoides is often found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea anthemoides has leaves that are oval-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases small seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea anthemoides is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, wooded areas and along stream banks. This plant thrives in partial to full shade and is often associated with rich, loamy soils. Its native range includes states such as Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee.</p>
<p>Actinea anthemoides is an important component of the understory vegetation in these forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea anthemoides was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has established itself in various regions outside its native range, often in disturbed or cultivated soils. The plant's adaptability to different environmental conditions has contributed to its spread. It is commonly found in moist, shady areas, including along roadsides and in urban environments.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation in certain ecosystems.</p>
