                    <h1>Aesculus polyneura</h1>
<p>Aesculus polyneura, commonly known as the Chinese horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and turn vibrant yellow in the autumn. The tree produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by spiny, globose fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The plant has a shallow root system, making it susceptible to windthrow and requiring careful planting conditions.</p>
