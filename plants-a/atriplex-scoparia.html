                    <h1>Atriplex scoparia</h1>
<p>Atriplex scoparia, commonly known as shadscale, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Atriplex scoparia is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.</p>
