                <h1>Adiantum shepherdii</h1>
<p>Adiantum shepherdii, commonly known as the Shepherd's fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically 15 to 30 centimeters long. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>Adiantum shepherdii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum shepherdii has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lacey appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically triangular in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 10 to 20 centimeters in length. They are usually a bright green color, with a smooth, leathery texture.</p>
<p>The plant has a slender, upright stem that is typically green or reddish in color, with a smooth bark and a branching growth pattern. Adiantum shepherdii does not produce flowers, and instead, it reproduces via spores rather than seeds, with the fronds bearing sporangia on the underside.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum shepherdii is primarily native to Mexico Central and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Adiantum shepherdii is often associated with limestone substrates.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific regions within central and western Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum shepherdii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century in Washington State. This fern is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and streamside habitats. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and cultivated environments.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and is often grown as an ornamental plant.</p>
