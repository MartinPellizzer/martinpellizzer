<p>Adiantum shepherdii, commonly known as the Shepherd's fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically 15 to 30 centimeters long. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>Adiantum shepherdii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
