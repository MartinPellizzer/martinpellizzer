                <h1>Acnistus ferrugineus</h1>
<p>Acnistus ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty acnistus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems covered in a rusty-colored bloom. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a rough texture with a reddish underside.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus ferrugineus has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus ferrugineus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodlands, rocky outcrops, and disturbed habitats. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen growing in coastal areas and along roadsides. It is also present in parts of the Middle East and southern Asia, where it has been introduced.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus ferrugineus was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in land reclamation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. However, its invasive nature has led to its spread beyond intended areas, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation. Despite its ecological benefits, it requires careful management to prevent overgrowth.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, wastelands, and riverbanks.</p>
