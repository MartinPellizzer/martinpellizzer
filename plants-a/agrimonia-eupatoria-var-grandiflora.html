                    <h1>Agrimonia eupatoria var. grandiflora</h1>
<p>Agrimonia eupatoria var. grandiflora, commonly known as greater agrimony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are palmately lobed with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flowers are followed by distinctive, winged fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts.</p>
<p>Agrimony is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has been historically used in herbal medicine.</p>
