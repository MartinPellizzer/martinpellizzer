<p>Arctium actinia, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spiky, burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its root system is extensive, and the roots are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Arctium actinia is also a common weed in agricultural fields and disturbed soils.</p>
