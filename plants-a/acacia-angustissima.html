                        <h1>Acacia angustissima</h1>
<p>Acacia angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late spring, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Acacia angustissima is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia angustissima is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in savannas and rocky outcrops. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the hot, dry climates of its native range. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Acacia angustissima plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia angustissima was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, often forming dense thickets. The plant is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. However, it can sometimes outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns.</p>
<p>Its introduction has had both positive and negative impacts on local ecosystems.</p>
