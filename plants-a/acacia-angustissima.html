                    <h1>Acacia angustissima</h1>
<p>Acacia angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late spring, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Acacia angustissima is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
