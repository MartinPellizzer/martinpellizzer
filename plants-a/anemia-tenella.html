                    <h1>Anemia tenella</h1>
<p>Anemia tenella, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marchantiaceae and is characterized by its thalloid structure, which is a flat, leaf-like body without true roots, stems, or leaves. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the thallus. Anemia tenella is often found growing on rocks, soil, or decaying wood in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and ability to absorb nutrients directly from the environment make it a significant pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
