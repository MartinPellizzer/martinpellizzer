<p>Asarum maruyamae, commonly known as the Maruyama asarum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and a distinctive, often fragrant, tubular flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its small, reddish-brown berries are an important food source for certain bird species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Asarum maruyamae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
