<p>Achillea asiatica, commonly known as Asian yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pinkish in color. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and features finely divided, fern-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is noted for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea asiatica has basal leaves that are lanceolate or linear, with a grayish-green color and a rough texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing from the base upward. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a cypsela, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their pappus structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea asiatica is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of southern Russia and western China, where it has been introduced or naturalized. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, often growing on slopes and in alpine meadows. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Achillea asiatica is considered to be of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>
