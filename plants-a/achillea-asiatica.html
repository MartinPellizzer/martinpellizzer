                <h1>Achillea asiatica</h1>
<p>Achillea asiatica, commonly known as Asiatic yarrow, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its feathery, finely divided leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is perennial and often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea asiatica has leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a gray-green color and a fuzzy texture due to fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, hairy, and slightly woody with a pale green to reddish-brown bark, growing upright and branching towards the top. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind due to their feathery pappus.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea asiatica is a flowering plant native to regions of Central and South Asia, including countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of the world, including the United States and Europe, often as an introduced species. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is commonly found in grasslands, steppes, and mountainous areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its conservation status may be threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea asiatica is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in diverse conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a summer growth cycle, producing its showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by a dormant period in winter.</p>
