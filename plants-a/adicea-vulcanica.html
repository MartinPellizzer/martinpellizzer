                <h1>Adicea vulcanica</h1>
<p>Adicea vulcanica, commonly known as the fire vine, is a unique flowering plant native to volcanic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-rich, mineral-laden soils found near active or dormant volcanoes. The plant features striking red and orange tubular flowers that attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are thick and waxy, helping to retain moisture in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Adicea vulcanica plays a vital role in stabilizing volcanic soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea vulcanica has leaves that are broad and elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, covered in a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and deep-reaching, anchoring the plant in volcanic soil and absorbing nutrients from the rocky terrain.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea vulcanica is primarily native to the volcanic regions of Central America, particularly in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.</p>
<p>It thrives in the nutrient-rich soils found in volcanic highlands and slopes. This plant is commonly found in cloud forests and along the edges of volcanic craters. It prefers humid climates with moderate temperatures and is often associated with areas of high biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Adicea vulcanica is relatively rare and found only in limited geographic locations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea vulcanica was mainly introduced to areas with volcanic soil and high temperatures, thriving in regions that mimic its native habitat.</p>
<p>It has been successfully established in several tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and resilience. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure, making it suitable for coastal and arid environments.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become an invasive species in certain ecosystems.</p>
