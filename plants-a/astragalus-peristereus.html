                    <h1>Astragalus peristereus</h1>
<p>Astragalus peristereus, commonly known as the golden milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Astragalus peristereus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environments.</p>
