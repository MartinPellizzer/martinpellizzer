<p>Aechmea parviflora, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual impact. Its foliage is often variegated with silver or white markings, enhancing its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Aechmea parviflora thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity to flourish.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea parviflora has broad, strap-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, thick stem covered in a fibrous, reddish-brown bark that grows upward from the base. Its flowers are clustered in a spike, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that produces small, black seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and absorb water and nutrients from the soil.</p>
