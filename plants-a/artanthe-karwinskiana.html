                    <h1>Artanthe karwinskiana</h1>
<p>Artanthe karwinskiana, commonly known as the Karwinskian stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high alpine regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in many botanical gardens and by gardeners interested in drought-tolerant plants.</p>
