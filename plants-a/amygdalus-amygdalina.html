                    <h1>Amygdalus amygdalina</h1>
<p>Amygdalus amygdalina, commonly known as the bitter almond tree, is a species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a small, deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by small, green fruits that mature into hard, brown nuts. The seeds, or almonds, contain a toxic compound called hydrocyanic acid, making them poisonous if consumed raw.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
