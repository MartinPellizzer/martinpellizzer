                <h1>Acmadenia heterophylla</h1>
<p>Acmadenia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable acmadenia, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves vary in shape and size depending on the environment. It is often found in coastal heathlands and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmadenia heterophylla has leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 2 to 6 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered with a rough, fissured bark that is usually grey to brown in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white or pale pink petals, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia heterophylla is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>This species is found in the coastal areas of the Western Cape region of South Africa. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline. The plant is well adapted to the mild, wet winters and dry summers of this region.</p>
<p>It is commonly seen in coastal vegetation types such as fynbos.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia heterophylla was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically found in coastal and heathland environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with mild temperatures and moderate rainfall, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. This plant is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value, particularly its attractive foliage and small flowers. It is often found in gardens and parks where it adds visual interest and supports local wildlife.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in natural habitats.</p>
