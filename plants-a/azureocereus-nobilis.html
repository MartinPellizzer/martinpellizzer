<p>Azureocereus nobilis, commonly known as the noble cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of white or pale blue flowers during the night, which are pollinated by bats and other nocturnal insects. Its spiny stems provide protection against herbivores, while its shallow root system allows it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Azureocereus nobilis is often cultivated for its striking appearance and ability to withstand extreme drought conditions.</p>
