                    <h1>Alnus incana f. subcordifolia</h1>
<p>Alnus incana f. subcordifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alder, is a variant of the gray alder, characterized by its distinctive subcordate (heart-shaped) leaves.</p>
<p>This shrub or small tree is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forest edges. Its leaves are typically smaller and more narrow than those of the typical form, and they have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are a key feature for identification.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
