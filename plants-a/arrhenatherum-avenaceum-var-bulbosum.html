<p>Arrhenatherum avenaceum var. bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and riverbanks. The plant features slender, tufted culms with dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its bulbous base, which allows it to store nutrients and survive harsh environmental conditions.</p>
