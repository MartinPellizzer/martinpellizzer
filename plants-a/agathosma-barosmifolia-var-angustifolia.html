                    <h1>Agathosma barosmifolia var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Agathosma barosmifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as Cape Geranium, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It is well adapted to hot, dry conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and traditional herbal uses.</p>
