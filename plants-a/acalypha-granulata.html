                <h1>Acalypha granulata</h1>
<p>Acalypha granulata, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste places.</p>
<p>Acalypha granulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha granulata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged oppositely along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, with a slightly rough texture. The stem is erect, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and consist of male and female parts on separate plants; they are typically greenish-white in color and bloom from late spring to early summer, relying on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-lobed, three-chambered capsule that disperses its seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha granulata is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, shaded areas within forests or along stream banks. It is typically found at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its distribution is limited, and it faces threats from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
