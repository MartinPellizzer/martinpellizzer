<p>Abies durangensis subsp.</p>
<p>coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuila fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, cylindrical cones that contain seeds, a feature common among fir species. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in pine-oak forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
