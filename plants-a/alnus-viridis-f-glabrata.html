                    <h1>Alnus viridis f. glabrata</h1>
<p>Alnus viridis f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaf alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round nuts that mature in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
