                <h1>Adnaria crenata</h1>
<p>Adnaria crenata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its blue or purple flowers and spiny, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and saline soils, showing a high tolerance for salt and wind. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
<p>Adnaria crenata is also sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria crenata has leaves that are alternate, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a wavy margin, and they are usually dark green in color.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, woody, and have a rough, fissured bark that is typically gray to brown in color. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria crenata is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, particularly on rocky shores and cliffs. This plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often growing in association with other halophytic species. Its distribution extends to parts of the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands as well.</p>
<p>Adnaria crenata is an important component of the coastal vegetation in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria crenata was mainly introduced to coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea, particularly in regions with warm, saline waters.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, sheltered environments where it can anchor itself to rocky substrates or artificial structures. This plant is often found in marine habitats such as harbors, marinas, and along rocky shores. Its introduction has led to changes in local ecosystems, affecting native species and altering sediment dynamics.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some parts of its range.</p>
