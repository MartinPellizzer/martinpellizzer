                <h1>Acisanthera rosulans</h1>
<p>Acisanthera rosulans, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern at the base.</p>
<p>Acisanthera rosulans thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acisanthera rosulans has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera rosulans is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, open habitats like grasslands and rocky outcrops. This species is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and receives moderate to high sunlight exposure. Its distribution is closely associated with the winter rainfall patterns of the region.</p>
<p>Acisanthera rosulans is often encountered in arid and semi-arid environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local fauna.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera rosulans was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the late 19th century and has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. The plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, forest margins, and urban areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to spread and compete with native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Acisanthera rosulans is considered a potential weed in some parts of New Zealand.</p>
