                <h1>Adinandra celebica</h1>
<p>Adinandra celebica, commonly known as the Celebes adinandra, is a flowering plant native to the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi and the Moluccas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers and leathery, elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. It thrives in tropical rainforest environments, often found in shaded undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra celebica has compound, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exhibits a somewhat fibrous texture. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the dry season; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that disperses its seeds through animal ingestion.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra celebica is primarily native to Sulawesi.</p>
<p>This species is found in the forests of this Indonesian island. It typically grows in lowland and montane forest areas. The plant is part of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes both primary and secondary vegetation types.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra celebica was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in secondary forests and along stream edges, often as an understorey plant. The distribution of this species is largely influenced by its preference for partial shade and consistent moisture. It has been documented in several Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has also been introduced to some regions outside its native range.</p>
