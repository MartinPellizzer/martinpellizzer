<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra celebica has compound, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and a yellowish-green stamen, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, globose drupe that splits open to release smooth, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in the soil and absorbing nutrients from the forest floor.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra celebica is a species of flowering plant native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.</p>
<p>It is currently found in the lowland and hill forests of the eastern part of the island. This plant thrives in humid, tropical environments with high rainfall and well-drained soils. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adinandra celebica is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, but its habitat is threatened by deforestation and land conversion.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adinandra celebica is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster and more reliable results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within several years under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants can enhance its growth and provide natural pest control.</p>
