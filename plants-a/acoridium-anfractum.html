                <h1>Acoridium anfractum</h1>
<p>Acoridium anfractum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Alismataceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous stem. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, which bloom during the summer months. Acoridium anfractum thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium anfractum has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 10-15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unbranched throughout its growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in spadices, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-chambered capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium anfractum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with swampy or wetland habitats where it can access the water it requires for growth. It plays an important ecological role in these ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not commonly found outside of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium anfractum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high humidity and well-drained soil, often found in forest understories. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed sites and can spread rapidly in areas with limited competition. Its introduction has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered a potential invasive species in some ecosystems.</p>
