                <h1>Acer negundo var. rubifolium</h1>
<p>Acer negundo var. rubifolium, commonly known as red-leaf maple, is a variant of the box elder tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red or orange foliage, which becomes more pronounced in the fall. The plant has alternate, palmately compound leaves that are typically 3 to 5 lobed. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and along streambanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer negundo var. rubifolium has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a reddish-purple coloration during the fall.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in catkins, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer negundo var. rubifolium is a variant of the box elder tree native to eastern North America, specifically found in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the northeastern and midwestern United States, as well as southern Ontario in Canada. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in riparian areas, river valleys, and open woodlands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not listed as endangered, it is considered a rare variant and is sometimes protected in certain regions due to its limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer negundo var. rubifolium is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant red foliage, making it a popular ornamental choice.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seed propagation requiring stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle involves rapid growth in spring and summer, followed by a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning should be done in late winter to maintain shape and remove diseased branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-tolerant species like ferns or heathers can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer negundo var. rubifolium is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its showy red foliage and nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local ecosystems. It acts as a companion plant in native landscapes, enhancing biodiversity and improving soil structure. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>This plant also contributes to nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and promoting the growth of other plant species.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer negundo var. rubifolium is a decorative tree known for its vibrant red foliage, making it a popular choice in ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal practices, it has been used in some indigenous cultures for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to the timber industry due to its fast growth and hard wood.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and renewal in various regions where it is cultivated.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer negundo var. rubifolium has several popular cultivars that are favored for their unique foliage and ornamental value, such as 'Autumn Flame' and 'Red Leaf Maple'.</p>
<p>These cultivars are often selected for their vibrant autumn color and compact growth habit. Hybrids involving this variety are less common, but some horticulturists have bred it with other maple species to enhance traits like cold hardiness and leaf color. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to provide seasonal interest in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its attractive features, it is increasingly used in urban landscaping and as a specimen tree.</p>
