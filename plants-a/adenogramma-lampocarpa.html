                <h1>Adenogramma lampocarpa</h1>
<p>Adenogramma lampocarpa, commonly known as the red-flowered adenogramma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Adenogramma lampocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenogramma lampocarpa has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unbranched until the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma lampocarpa is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California.</p>
<p>It is found in areas with rocky soils and open habitats such as chaparral and coastal sage scrub. This plant thrives in regions characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It is commonly observed in coastal and inland areas of southern California.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that provide the right balance of sunlight and moisture.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma lampocarpa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The plant has since spread beyond cultivation and is now considered invasive in some areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and can outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
