<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring broad, palmate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spiky, woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and adaptability contribute to its use in landscaping and horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon hypoleucum has leaves that are heart-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, and it grows as an upright shrub. The flowers are pendulous, with five petals forming a funnel shape, and they are typically pale yellow to white in color, blooming from spring to early summer; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in its survival in various environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
