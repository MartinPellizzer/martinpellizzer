                    <h1>Anblatum tournefortii</h1>
<p>Anblatum tournefortii, commonly known as the Desert Dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep roots and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Anblatum tournefortii is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its resilience in harsh environments.</p>
