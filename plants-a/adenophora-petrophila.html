                <h1>Adenophora petrophila</h1>
<p>Adenophora petrophila, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a fine, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Adenophora petrophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora petrophila has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a low, spreading pattern. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and range in color from pale blue to lavender, blooming in late summer to early autumn; they are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from rocky soils, allowing the plant to thrive in mountainous environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora petrophila is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, particularly in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils found in forested areas and slopes. This species is commonly found in the Yangtze River basin and surrounding highlands. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often associated with coniferous and mixed forests.</p>
<p>Adenophora petrophila is a rare and endangered plant, with limited distribution and specific ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora petrophila was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or steep slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates. This plant is typically distributed in high-altitude environments, often growing in crevices or on cliffs. Its introduction is often associated with natural dispersal through wind or animal activity.</p>
<p>The distribution of Adenophora petrophila is limited to specific ecological niches that support its growth.</p>
