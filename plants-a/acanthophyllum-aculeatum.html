                        <h1>Acanthophyllum aculeatum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum aculeatum, commonly known as the spiny saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually short and covered in fine hairs, and the stems are often spiny, providing protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum aculeatum is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
