                    <h1>Adenostegia rigida var. macrocephala</h1>
<p>Adenostegia rigida var. macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed desert broom, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branched growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
