<p>Aetanthus, commonly known as the bluebell or wild hyacinth, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaryllidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Aetanthus species typically grow in woodland areas and are adapted to moist, well-drained soils. They have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Aetanthus sylvaticus, which is native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
