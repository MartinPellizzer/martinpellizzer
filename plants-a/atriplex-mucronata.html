                    <h1>Atriplex mucronata</h1>
<p>Atriplex mucronata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to salty and dry environments. The plant produces small greenish or yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity.</p>
<p>Atriplex mucronata plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
