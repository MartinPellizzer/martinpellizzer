                    <h1>Alopecurus antarcticus var. lechleri</h1>
<p>Alopecurus antarcticus var. lechleri, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale blue or white flowers. This plant is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, wind-swept environments, often found in alpine and subantarctic regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The plant has limited commercial use but is of ecological importance in its native habitats.</p>
