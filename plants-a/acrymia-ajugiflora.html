                <h1>Acrymia ajugiflora</h1>
<p>Acrymia ajugiflora, commonly known as the Chinese bellflower, is a perennial herb native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Acrymia ajugiflora is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrymia ajugiflora has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, blue-black drupe containing one seed, which is dispersed by birds due to its attractive color and flavor.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrymia ajugiflora is primarily native to Malaya.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of this area, particularly in the western part of the Malay Peninsula. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within lowland forests. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and thrives in humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrymia ajugiflora was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in during the early 20th century as part of ornamental plant introductions. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. It is commonly found in gardens and naturalized areas along the coast.</p>
<p>However, it has not become invasive and is considered a non-native but manageable species in its introduced range.</p>
