                <h1>Acinodendron desmanthum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron desmanthum, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are small, oval, and often covered in fine hairs, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron desmanthum has compound leaves that are pinnate, with oval-shaped leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length and displaying a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron desmanthum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in lowland and hill forests. This plant is commonly associated with areas near rivers and streams, where the soil remains consistently damp. Its natural habitat includes secondary growth forests and disturbed areas that have not been heavily altered by human activity.</p>
<p>Acinodendron desmanthum plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron desmanthum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and degraded forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and well-drained soil conditions. The plant is particularly common in the southeastern United States, where it has become an invasive species in some areas. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands contribute to its success in colonizing new environments.</p>
<p>However, it can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns in certain regions.</p>
