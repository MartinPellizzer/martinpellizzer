                <h1>Achoriphragma australe</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma australe, commonly known as the Australian sandbur, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal, a common trait in arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Achoriphragma australe thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of Australia.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma australe has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that develops fissures with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late summer to autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma australe is primarily native to southern Australia, including parts of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland dune environments. This plant thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is an important component of the local flora in these areas, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is sometimes considered a rare or endangered species in certain parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma australe was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in coastal and agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
