                <h1>Acer fulgens</h1>
<p>Acer fulgens, commonly known as the flame maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright red foliage that turns orange and yellow in the fall. The leaves are typically ovate or elliptic, with coarsely toothed margins. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and appear in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>The tree produces samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds via wind.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer fulgens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a vibrant green color during the growing season and a striking red or orange hue in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher and more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated, producing abundant pollen. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod that matures in late summer, dispersing by wind due to its light weight and shape.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer fulgens is a striking tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes dry to moist forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the states of Oaxaca and Puebla. The species thrives in well-drained soils and requires a temperate climate with distinct wet and dry seasons.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer fulgens is considered vulnerable and is listed as a species of concern in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer fulgens is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and elegant form.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle of Acer fulgens includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer fulgens is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>
