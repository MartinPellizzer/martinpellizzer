                <h1>Acer fulgens</h1>
<p>Acer fulgens, commonly known as the flame maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, red-orange flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are palmately lobed, typically with five to nine pointed lobes, and turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree grows to a height of 10 to 30 meters and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and parks for its seasonal display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer fulgens has leaves that are broadly ovate to rhombic in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length; they are bright green during the growing season and turn vivid orange-red in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and grayish-brown, with a straight growth pattern, and the bark becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, yellow-green, and clustered in cymes, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to their light weight and winged structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer fulgens is a species of maple native to the highlands of Central America, specifically found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of the southern United States, as an ornamental plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers shady to partially sunny environments. This species is typically found at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited natural population, Acer fulgens is considered endangered in its native range, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer fulgens is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and ornate branching structure.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle of Acer fulgens involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and health are essential for optimal growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>
