<p>Anisopappus chinensis subsp.</p>
<p>buchwaldii, commonly known as the Chinese sandmat, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots enable it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
