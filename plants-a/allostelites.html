<p>Allostelites, commonly known as the "garden spider," is a genus of orb-weaving spiders found in various regions around the world.</p>
<p>These plants are not actually plants but spiders, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. If you were referring to a plant, please provide the correct name. Allostelites are known for constructing intricate, circular webs to catch prey.</p>
<p>They play a role in controlling insect populations in their habitats.</p>
