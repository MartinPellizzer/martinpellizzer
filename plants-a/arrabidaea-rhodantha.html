                    <h1>Arrabidaea rhodantha</h1>
<p>Arrabidaea rhodantha, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
