                <h1>Abutilon viscosum</h1>
<p>Abutilon viscosum, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its capsule fruits contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Velvetleaf is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon viscosum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a sticky, glandular layer, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are pendulous, with five fused petals forming a bell-shaped structure, and are usually yellow or orange, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon viscosum is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is now also cultivated in parts of the United States and other regions with similar climates. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, shaded areas near rivers or in humid forests. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Abutilon viscosum is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon viscosum is a fast-growing, deciduous shrub known for its velvety leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method. The plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in spring and summer, and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and prune to maintain shape and encourage flowering. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and improve garden aesthetics.</p>
