                    <h1>Arnica alpina var. vahliana</h1>
<p>Arnica alpina var. vahliana, commonly known as the alpine tawny hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features upright, hairy stems that bear yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive central disk. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is often mistaken for other arnica species due to its similar floral structure and coloration.</p>
