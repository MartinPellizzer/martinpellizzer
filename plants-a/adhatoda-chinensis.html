                <h1>Adhatoda chinensis</h1>
<p>Adhatoda chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese arrowroot or Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported respiratory and digestive benefits.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and pharmacological research.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda chinensis has simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are tubular, typically blue or violet in color, and bloom from June to August, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant, though they are not particularly showy.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda chinensis is primarily native to southern and eastern Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist environments like riverbanks and forests. The plant is commonly used in traditional medicine for its medicinal properties. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely linked to the humid climates of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda chinensis was mainly introduced to new environments for its medicinal properties and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This plant has been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean as a result of human activity and trade. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in some areas, sometimes becoming invasive.</p>
<p>Careful management is necessary to prevent it from outcompeting native species in these regions.</p>
