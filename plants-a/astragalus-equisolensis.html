<p>Astragalus equisolensis, commonly known as the Andean milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the summer months. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Astragalus equisolensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations.</p>
