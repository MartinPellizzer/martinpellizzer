                <h1>Actaea rubra</h1>
<p>Actaea rubra, commonly known as red baneberry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking red berries that contrast with its compound leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade. Its showy flowers, which appear in early summer, are white and have five sepals that resemble petals.</p>
<p>Actaea rubra is toxic to humans and animals, containing compounds that can cause severe gastrointestinal distress.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea rubra has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are doubly or triply divided, with a bright green color and a serrated edge, typically measuring 5–15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker and more furrowed with age, growing upright and branching near the base. Its flowers are white, clustered in upright cymes, with five petal-like sepals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, berry-like aggregate composed of small follicles, dispersing seeds by wind and animals after ripening in late summer.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively through underground stems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea rubra is primarily native to Alaska, Alberta, Arizona, British Columbia, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Labrador, Maine, Manitoba, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Brunswick, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Newfoundland, North Dakota, Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Ohio, Ontario, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Prince Edward Island, Québec, Rhode Island, Saskatchewan, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, Wyoming, Yukon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shady woodlands and along streambanks across these regions. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with deciduous forests. Actaea rubra is known for its striking red flowers and is sometimes called the "red baneberry.".</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar to pollinators and serving as a food source for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea rubra was mainly introduced to Finland and Norway.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest environments in these regions. The plant has been documented growing in both natural and disturbed habitats. Its introduction has been linked to horticultural activities and accidental spread.</p>
<p>It is considered a non-native species in these areas.</p>
