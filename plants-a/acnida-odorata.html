                <h1>Acnida odorata</h1>
<p>Acnida odorata, commonly known as the fragrant acacia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers and slender, woody stems. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Acnida odorata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>Its aromatic leaves and flowers make it a notable species in its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnida odorata has leaves that are opposite in arrangement, ovate in shape, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and have a pale yellow color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida odorata is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry savannas and woodland areas where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is also present in parts of Madagascar and some regions of southern Arabia. It is often associated with rocky or sandy habitats and can be found at elevations ranging from sea level to approximately 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its aromatic properties, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida odorata was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its fragrant flowers and attractive foliage. The plant has since spread into nearby wetlands and disturbed habitats, often outcompeting native species. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to protect local biodiversity.</p>
