<p>Atriplex axillaris, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in coastal areas with high salt exposure.</p>
<p>Atriplex axillaris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
