                    <h1>Abies × kentiana</h1>
<p>Abies × kentiana, commonly known as the Colorado blue spruce, is a hybrid conifer resulting from the cross between *Abies lasiocarpa* and *Abies concolor*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark blue-green foliage and a pyramidal shape, which makes it a popular ornamental tree. The needles are stiff and often have a bluish tinge due to a waxy coating, and the cones are typically short and cylindrical. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for colder climates.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness in northern regions.</p>
