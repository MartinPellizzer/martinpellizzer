                        <h1>Abies × kentiana</h1>
<p>Abies × kentiana, commonly known as the Colorado blue spruce, is a hybrid conifer resulting from the cross between *Abies lasiocarpa* and *Abies concolor*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark blue-green foliage and a pyramidal shape, which makes it a popular ornamental tree. The needles are stiff and often have a bluish tinge due to a waxy coating, and the cones are typically short and cylindrical. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for colder climates.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness in northern regions.</p>

<p>It occurs naturally in areas spanning from British Columbia through Idaho and into northern California. This hybrid species is commonly found in coniferous forests at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its natural range includes regions where the parent species, Abies amabilis and Abies lasiocarpa, overlap.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies × kentiana was mainly introduced to the United States and Europe as an ornamental tree due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Abies amabilis and Abies alba, combining the characteristics of both parent species. This plant is commonly found in botanical gardens and landscaped areas where it is valued for its pyramidal shape and dense foliage.
