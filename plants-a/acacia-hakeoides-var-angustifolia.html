<p>Acacia hakeoides var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features feathery, bipinnate leaves that are narrow and often densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that appear in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and hardy nature make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental planting.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia hakeoides var. angustifolia is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops and sandy soils. It is commonly found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia hakeoides var. angustifolia was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, particularly in the Western Cape. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its feathery foliage and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>However, it has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, leading to concerns about its impact on native vegetation.</p>
