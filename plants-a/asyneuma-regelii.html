<p>Asyneuma regelii, commonly known as the Regel's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as oaks and maples, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are red or black and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Asyneuma regelii is native to regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
