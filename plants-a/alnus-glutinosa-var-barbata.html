                    <h1>Alnus glutinosa var. barbata</h1>
<p>Alnus glutinosa var. barbata, commonly known as the sticky alder or barbate alder, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that release a resinous substance, which gives the plant its common name. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate to elliptical in shape, and have a serrated margin. It produces small, yellowish catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain one or two seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, acidic soils and is known for its role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria.</p>
