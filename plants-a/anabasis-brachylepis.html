<p>Anabasis brachylepis, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to harsh, saline environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by insects and birds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deep underground.</p>
<p>Anabasis brachylepis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
