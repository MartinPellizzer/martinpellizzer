                    <h1>Athyrium filix-femina var. rubripes</h1>
<p>Athyrium filix-femina var. rubripes, commonly known as the red-stemmed lady fern, is a variant of the common lady fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive reddish stems and finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a delicate, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
