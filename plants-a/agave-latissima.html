                    <h1>Agave latissima</h1>
<p>Agave latissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf agave, is a striking succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height, with narrow, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces large, terminal inflorescences with white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom only once in its lifetime. Its leaves are thick and store water, making it highly drought-resistant.</p>
<p>Agave latissima is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant due to its architectural form and hardy nature.</p>
