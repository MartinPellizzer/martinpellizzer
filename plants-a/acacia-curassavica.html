                        <h1>Acacia curassavica</h1>
<p>Acacia curassavica, commonly known as the flame acacia, is a fast-growing, deciduous tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, often thriving in coastal areas. Its bark is smooth and light gray, while its wood is lightweight and durable.</p>
<p>Acacia curassavica is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia curassavica is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and parts of the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is also found in regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Venezuela. This species thrives in coastal areas, dry forests, and sandy soils. It is commonly associated with disturbed habitats and can often be seen growing along roadsides and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other tropical and subtropical regions around the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia curassavica was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential for erosion control.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant has been introduced to several countries in the Americas, including the Caribbean and parts of South America. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats have led to its spread beyond cultivated areas.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its competitive nature and ability to form dense stands.</p>
