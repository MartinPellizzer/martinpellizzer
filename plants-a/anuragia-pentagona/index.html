                            <h1>Anuragia Pentagona</h1>
<p>Five-angled anuragia, scientifically known as Anuragia pentagona, is a rare and intriguing species of flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. This unique plant is characterized by its distinctive five-angled seed pods, which give it its common name and set it apart from other members of the Apiaceae family. Found primarily in moist, shaded forest environments, it thrives in nutrient-rich soil and requires careful cultivation to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and delicate growth habits, the plant is considered endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival. Its striking appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
