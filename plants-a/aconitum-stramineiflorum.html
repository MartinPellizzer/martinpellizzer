                <h1>Aconitum stramineiflorum</h1>
<p>Aconitum stramineiflorum, commonly known as the yellow aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in July and August. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Aconitum stramineiflorum is part of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its toxic properties due to the presence of various alkaloids.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum stramineiflorum has leaves that are compound, with lanceolate leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, typically ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length, and are dark green in color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a pale green to brownish color, growing in a straight, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are showy, blue to violet in color, arranged in racemes, and have a spurred structure typical of the genus, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a network that helps the plant anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum stramineiflorum is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>This species is found in the mountainous regions of this area, where it thrives in temperate climates. It is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils in forested or rocky habitats. The plant is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific regions within China South-Central, where it has adapted to the local environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum stramineiflorum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was primarily brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive blue to purple flowers. The plant has established itself in moist, shady areas along streams and in forested habitats. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>However, further research is needed to fully understand its ecological effects.</p>
