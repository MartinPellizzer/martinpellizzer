                        <h1>Acalypha conferta</h1>
<p>Acalypha conferta, commonly known as the silverleaf acalypha, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Acalypha conferta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive leaves and ease of care.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha conferta is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and partial to full sunlight. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in secondary forest understories.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also reported in parts of Oceania, such as Papua New Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha conferta was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there by early settlers or through horticultural trade in the 19th or early 20th century. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas, spreading through both seeds and vegetative growth. It is now considered a potential invasive species in some regions of Hawaii, where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas but remains a concern for local ecosystems.</p>
