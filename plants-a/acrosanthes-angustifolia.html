                <h1>Acrosanthes angustifolia</h1>
<p>Acrosanthes angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a flowering plant native to the south-west of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spike. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that are arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster. Acrosanthes angustifolia typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>It is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrosanthes angustifolia has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that remains relatively unbroken as the plant grows. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosanthes angustifolia is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the coastal and mountainous regions of this area. It thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal vegetation. The species is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a characteristic component of the fynbos flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosanthes angustifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
