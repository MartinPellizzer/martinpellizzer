<p>Alsine holosteoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Alsine holosteoides is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
