<p>It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves with a rough, textured surface and prominent veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed, winged fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental potential and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha reticulata var. arborea has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is brown to reddish in color, and it exhibits a branched growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white bracts and stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release three winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
