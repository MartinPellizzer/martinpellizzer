                    <h1>Achasma sphaerocephalum var. rubrostriatum</h1>
<p>Achasma sphaerocephalum var. rubrostriatum, commonly known as the red-striated globe lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its distinctive, rounded thallus with a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Its upper surface is typically pale yellow to orange, while the lower surface is darker, often with a reddish or brownish hue. The species exhibits a unique pattern of reddish striations along the lobes, which are more pronounced in certain environmental conditions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on decaying wood or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This lichen is of interest to mycologists due to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and its potential use in environmental monitoring.</p>
