                    <h1>Aloe wickensii var. lutea</h1>
<p>Aloe wickensii var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically yellowish-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces striking orange to red flowers during the summer months, which are borne on tall, branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
