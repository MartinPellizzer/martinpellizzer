                <h1>Acourtia glomeriflora</h1>
<p>Acourtia glomeriflora, commonly known as the clustered-flower acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acourtia glomeriflora is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia glomeriflora has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dull green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is upright and branched, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanging throughout the plant's life. The flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring five white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soils in which the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia glomeriflora is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in regions with specific environmental conditions that support its growth. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and sufficient sunlight. The plant is often associated with rocky or disturbed habitats in these regions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the varied ecological zones within central and northern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia glomeriflora was mainly introduced to areas with specific soil and climate conditions that mimic its native habitat.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for certain regions in the United States. This plant is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites where it can establish quickly. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native environments.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread beyond controlled areas.</p>
