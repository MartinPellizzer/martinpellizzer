                <h1>Achillea depressa</h1>
<p>Achillea depressa, commonly known as the low yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features basal rosettes of finely divided, gray-green leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in flat-topped clusters. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a popular choice for gardens and wildflower meadows.</p>
<p>Achillea depressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea depressa has leaves that are basal, spoon-shaped (spatulate), with a silver-gray underside and a dark green upper surface, arranged in a rosette formation, and are typically 2-5 cm long.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-brown color, with a branching pattern that supports the flowering heads. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray flowers, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea depressa is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Europe, where it has been introduced and sometimes naturalized. It thrives in dry, rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats like alpine meadows and slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Achillea depressa is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea depressa is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region, known for its compact form and delicate white flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the root clumps in early spring or by sowing seeds in a well-draining seed-starting mix. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth occurring in spring and flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea depressa is a low-growing perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of nearby flora. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing land.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea depressa is a flowering plant known for its historical and potential medicinal uses, including its possible role in treating wounds and inflammation.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it has been traditionally incorporated into herbal remedies. Its aromatic properties have led to some interest in its potential industrial applications, such as in perfumery or aromatherapy.
