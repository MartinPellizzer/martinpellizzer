                <h1>Achillea depressa</h1>
<p>Achillea depressa, commonly known as the cushion yarrow, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, compact clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels. The plant has silvery-gray leaves that are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of short hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Achillea depressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea depressa has leaves that are basal, forming a rosette, with oblanceolate to ovate shapes, typically 2–5 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, with a gray-green color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and somewhat branched, with a greenish-gray bark that is smooth and slightly woody. The flowers are clustered in flat-topped umbels, consisting of small white to pale yellow ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea depressa is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas along the Pacific coast, particularly in coastal scrub and maritime chaparral habitats. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in environments with mild, moist climates. This species typically grows at elevations between 0 and 600 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Achillea depressa is considered a species of concern and is listed as threatened or endangered in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea depressa is a low-growing perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within two to three years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid over-saturation. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring, and regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too wet.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea depressa is a low-growing perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which feed on its seeds and foliage. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic compounds. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea depressa also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
