<p>Aeonium × zoae, commonly known as the "Coral Cactus," is a hybrid succulent plant belonging to the Crassulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that range from green to red or pink, depending on light exposure. The plant produces vibrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring or summer. Native to the Canary Islands, it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ability to form offsets make it relatively easy to propagate and maintain.</p>
