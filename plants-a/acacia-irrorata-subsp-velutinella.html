<p>Acacia irrorata subsp.</p>
<p>velutinella, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its pale yellow flowers and slender, often glabrous or softly hairy stems.</p>
<p>The leaves are bipinnate, with small, thread-like leaflets that give the plant a delicate appearance. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in revegetation projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils in harsh environments.</p>
