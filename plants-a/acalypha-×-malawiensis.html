                        <h1>Acalypha × malawiensis</h1>
<p>Acalypha × malawiensis, commonly known as the Malawi spurflower, is a hybrid shrub native to the tropical regions of Eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that range from red to orange, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>

<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many tropical and temperate species with varied morphological features. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse forms and often contains latex-producing species. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cudweed," characterized by their showy bracts and often hairy foliage.</p>
