                    <h1>Amygdalus decipiens</h1>
<p>Amygdalus decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive almond, is a species of shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, green fruits that mature into red, fleshy drupes, which are edible but have a mild, sweet flavor. It is often mistaken for the true almond (Prunus dulcis) due to its similar appearance, leading to its common name.</p>
<p>The deceptive almond is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal.</p>
