<p>Aspidium diplazioides, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium diplazioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
