                <h1>Achillea lucida</h1>
<p>Achillea lucida, commonly known as white yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that are aromatic and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its historical use dates back to ancient times, where it was believed to have healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea lucida has leaves that are narrow, linear, and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-yellow color, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and arranged in flat, composite flower heads, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea lucida is a perennial herb native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of northern Africa and the Middle East, with some introduced populations in North America. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, or gravelly soils and is commonly found in open woodlands, scrublands, and along roadsides. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea lucida is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although its populations are becoming increasingly fragmented due to habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea lucida is a perennial plant known for its bright yellow flowers and hardy nature, commonly grown in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining its genetic traits. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring moderate watering to avoid root rot.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. While generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
