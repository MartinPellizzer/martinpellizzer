                <h1>Achoriphragma tianschanicum</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma tianschanicum, commonly known as the Tianshan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly the Tianshan range.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Achoriphragma tianschanicum is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in dry gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma tianschanicum has leaves that are typically narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in dense clumps. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma tianschanicum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly the Tianshan Mountains.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as China, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. This plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments at high elevations. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often in areas with limited vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the unique climatic conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma tianschanicum was mainly introduced to specific regions in Central Asia, particularly in the Tianshan Mountains.</p>
<p>It was introduced to areas where its ecological niche could be fulfilled, such as rocky slopes and alpine meadows. The introduction was likely for ornamental purposes or for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes. However, it has since become naturalized in some local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now limited to the regions where it was first introduced.</p>
