<p>Agrostis viridis, commonly known as green oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has fine, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, greenish-brown florets. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Agrostis viridis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
