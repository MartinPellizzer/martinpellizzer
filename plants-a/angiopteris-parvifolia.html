<p>Angiopteris parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Angiopteris parvifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
