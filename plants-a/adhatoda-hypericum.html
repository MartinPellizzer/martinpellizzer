                <h1>Adhatoda hypericum</h1>
<p>Adhatoda hypericum, commonly known as the blue morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Botanically, it belongs to the family Convolvulaceae, which includes other flowering plants with climbing or trailing growth habits.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been studied for their potential health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda hypericum has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, longitudinal strips. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in spikes, displaying a striking combination of blue-violet and yellow, blooming from April to June and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda hypericum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is also found in regions of Africa, particularly in East Africa like Kenya and Tanzania. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas within forests or along stream banks. It is commonly used in traditional medicine for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes diverse ecosystems ranging from lowland forests to mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda hypericum was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used as a biocontrol agent against weeds such as Parthenium hysterophorus. The plant is native to Africa but has been introduced to several regions including South America and parts of Asia. It thrives in disturbed soils and can grow in a variety of climates.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive itself in some ecosystems.</p>
