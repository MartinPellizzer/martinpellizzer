                <h1>Acinodendron radulifolium</h1>
<p>Acinodendron radulifolium, commonly known as the radulate-leaf acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into several narrow, linear segments. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically yellow or greenish in color, and it produces small, dry fruits.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique leaf morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron radulifolium has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows in a shrub-like form with multiple branches. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron radulifolium is primarily native to the western regions of Africa, specifically countries such as Ghana, Togo, and Benin.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained to moderately wet soils. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and can be found in both natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific regions within West Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron radulifolium was mainly introduced to the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its unique leaf structure and flowering habit. The plant has since become naturalized in several coastal regions, often growing in sandy soils near the shoreline. It is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly.</p>
<p>However, it is not yet classified as invasive in most regions.</p>
