                <h1>Aegiphila lanata</h1>
<p>Aegiphila lanata, commonly known as the woolly aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a fuzzy appearance. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Aegiphila lanata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila lanata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a silvery-white underside and a dark green upper surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are relatively small, measuring up to 5 cm in length, and are covered in fine, silky hairs that give them a woolly texture. The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like surface that is typically brown or reddish-brown, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and have a pale yellow to white color; they bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
