                        <h1>Acetosella affinis</h1>
<p>Acetosella affinis, commonly known as the spring sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, woodland soils and is often found in shaded, cool environments. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities, though the plant is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Acetosella affinis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
