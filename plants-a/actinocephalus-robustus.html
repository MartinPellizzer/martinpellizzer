                <h1>Actinocephalus robustus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus robustus, commonly known as the robust starwort, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers are typically yellow to orange in color. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads.</p>
<p>Actinocephalus robustus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus robustus has compound leaves that are pinnate in arrangement, with leaflets that are elliptical in shape, medium in size, and typically green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a yellow color, blooming during the summer months; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus robustus is primarily native to southern Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and savanna habitats. This species thrives in regions with a temperate to warm climate and well-drained soils. It is often associated with rocky outcrops and sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the seasonal rainfall patterns of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus robustus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species that has spread throughout various regions of the country. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation have led to significant ecological impacts.</p>
<p>Control measures are being implemented to limit its spread and protect native ecosystems.</p>
