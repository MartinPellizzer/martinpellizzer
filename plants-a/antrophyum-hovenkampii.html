                    <h1>Antrophyum hovenkampii</h1>
<p>Antrophyum hovenkampii, commonly known as the Hovenkamp's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
