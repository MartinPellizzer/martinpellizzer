                    <h1>Astyposanthes subviscosa</h1>
<p>Astyposanthes subviscosa, commonly known as the sticky astyposanthes, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its viscid, sticky leaves, which give it its common name and help in reducing water loss in its often humid and tropical habitat. The plant typically grows as a low shrub, with small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale in color. Its botanical features include opposite leaves and a compact growth habit, making it distinct from other members of the Gesneriaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
