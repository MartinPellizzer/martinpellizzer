                    <h1>Angianthus codonopappus</h1>
<p>Angianthus codonopappus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white pappus structures that aid in seed dispersal. It has adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to survive in extreme conditions.</p>
