                        <h1>Acacia hirsuta</h1>
<p>Acacia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and pairs of small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Acacia hirsuta is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species that thrives in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of browse for livestock.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia hirsuta is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in areas with low rainfall. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Acacia hirsuta plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various animals.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia hirsuta was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Australia, parts of Africa, and some areas of the Middle East where it serves as a valuable source of fodder for livestock. The plant's rapid growth and spreading habit have led to its establishment in natural ecosystems, sometimes becoming invasive. Its introduction has also been associated with land rehabilitation efforts in degraded soils.</p>
<p>However, its spread requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
