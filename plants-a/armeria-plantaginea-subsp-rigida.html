<p>Armeria plantaginea subsp.</p>
<p>rigida, commonly known as the rigid sandverbena, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>The plant features linear, gray-green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats.</p>
<p>The rigid sandverbena is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators.</p>
