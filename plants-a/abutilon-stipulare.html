<p>Abutilon stipulare, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, lantern-like yellow flowers. The plant has a fibrous, woody stem with a rough, hairy texture, and its leaves are typically large, broad, and have prominent veins. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by insects, making it an important plant in ecological and ornamental contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon stipulare has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, somewhat woody at maturity, with a smooth, pale green to brown bark that peels in thin layers. The flowers are pendulous, yellowish-green with orange-red staminodes, arranged in clusters, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a 3-lobed follicle that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and moderately deep, helping the plant anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
