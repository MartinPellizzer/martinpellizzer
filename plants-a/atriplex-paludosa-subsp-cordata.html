<p>Atriplex paludosa subsp.</p>
<p>cordata, commonly known as marsh saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to wetland and saline environments in North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid or brackish conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it an important species in stabilizing coastal and marsh ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is often found in association with other halophytic plants in saline soils.</p>
