<p>Achillea getica, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant features slender, linear leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in flat-topped clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Achillea getica is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea getica has basal leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a silver-gray underside and a dark green upper surface, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green color, growing from the base to form a compact plant. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea getica is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula, particularly found in parts of Greece, Albania, and the former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>It is now also cultivated in other regions, including parts of Europe and North America, as a ornamental plant. This species thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along roadsides. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea getica is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, but its wild populations are becoming less common due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
