<p>Atraphaxis suaedifolia, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has small, gray-green, fleshy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species for desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Atraphaxis suaedifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping.</p>
