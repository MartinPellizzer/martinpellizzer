<p>Acer truncatum, commonly known as the cut-leaved maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a serrated edge. The tree produces small, red to orange-red flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Acer truncatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant fall foliage, which displays shades of yellow and red.</p>
