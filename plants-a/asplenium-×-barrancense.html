                    <h1>Asplenium × barrancense</h1>
<p>Asplenium × barrancense, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium × barrancense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
