                            <h1>Anemone Quinquefolia Var. Oregana</h1>
<p>Oregon anemone, scientifically known as Anemone quinquefolia var. oregana, is a striking native plant of the Pacific Northwest. With its delicate white petals and bright green leaves, it adds a touch of elegance to woodland gardens. This perennial wildflower thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found along stream banks and forest floors. Its blooms typically appear in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Despite its beauty, the Oregon anemone is threatened by habitat loss and overcollection, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
