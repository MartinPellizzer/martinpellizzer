                    <h1>Azolla caroliniana</h1>
<p>Azolla caroliniana, commonly known as the floating fern or water clover, is a small aquatic fern that forms dense mats on the surface of freshwater bodies.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, floating leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in diameter, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is capable of rapid growth and can form extensive colonies, often covering entire ponds or slow-moving streams. Azolla caroliniana has a symbiotic relationship with the cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae, which fixes atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the surrounding water with nutrients.</p>
<p>This makes it an important species in aquatic ecosystems and a potential candidate for bioremediation efforts.</p>
