                <h1>Acalypha subviscida var. lovelandii</h1>
<p>Acalypha subviscida var. lovelandii, commonly known as the Loveland glorybower, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glandular-hairy foliage and showy, clustered inflorescences that range from pink to red. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy surface and prominent veins. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha subviscida var. lovelandii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, slightly woody texture and a light green to brownish color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with a greenish-white color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds through wind, with the seeds being tiny and having a papery covering.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha subviscida var. lovelandii is a rare plant species native to the southern United States, specifically found in Texas and parts of New Mexico.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in the Chihuahuan Desert region. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils or on limestone substrates. This variety typically occurs at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss and climate change, it is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha subviscida var. lovelandii is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings, which root easily in moist soil, or through seeds sown in spring. This fast-growing plant thrives in warm climates and has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering plants can enhance its visual appeal and promote a healthy garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha subviscida var. lovelandii is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its vibrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing the health of surrounding vegetation. The plant also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system, stabilizing soil in coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a range of native species.</p>
