<p>Atriplex pseudocampanulata, commonly known as the silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are succulent and often have a salty taste, reflecting its adaptation to saline soils.</p>
<p>Atriplex pseudocampanulata plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
