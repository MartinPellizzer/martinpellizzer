<p>Atriplex maritima, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant leaves that help it survive in arid and saline environments. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Atriplex maritima is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and reduce erosion in coastal areas.</p>
