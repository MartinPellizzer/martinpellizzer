<p>Atriplex triangularis, commonly known as the triangular saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its triangular-shaped leaves, which are typically succulent and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing coastal and inland dunes. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness.</p>
<p>Atriplex triangularis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native fauna.</p>
