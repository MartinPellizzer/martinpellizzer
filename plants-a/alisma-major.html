<p>Alisma major, commonly known as greater waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted for water habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, often emerging from the water's surface. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize new areas within its wetland habitat.</p>
<p>Alisma major plays an important role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
