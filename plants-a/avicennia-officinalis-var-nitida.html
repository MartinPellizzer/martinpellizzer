                    <h1>Avicennia officinalis var. nitida</h1>
<p>Avicennia officinalis var. nitida, commonly known as the slender mangrove, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in coastal and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, opposite leaves that are covered in a dense layer of salt-excreting glands. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, and its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release buoyant seeds for dispersal. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly adapted to fluctuating salinity levels and tidal conditions, making it an important species in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
