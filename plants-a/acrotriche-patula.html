<p>Acrotriche patula, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Acrotriche patula is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
