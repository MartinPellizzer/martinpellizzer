                <h1>Acrotriche patula</h1>
<p>Acrotriche patula, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Acrotriche patula is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotriche patula has leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals, and bloom during the spring and early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid environments where the plant typically thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche patula is primarily native to South Australia and Western Australia.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these states. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as plains and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the dry climate and can survive with minimal water.</p>
<p>It is an important part of the local flora and contributes to the biodiversity of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche patula was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species that spreads rapidly in disturbed environments. The plant thrives in coastal dunes and sandy soils, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental transport via human activity.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it poses a threat to local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
