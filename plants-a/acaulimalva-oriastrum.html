                        <h1>Acaulimalva oriastrum</h1>
<p>Acaulimalva oriastrum, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, flat seeds.</p>
<p>Acaulimalva oriastrum is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can withstand extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
