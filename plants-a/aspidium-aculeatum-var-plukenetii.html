                    <h1>Aspidium aculeatum var. plukenetii</h1>
<p>Aspidium aculeatum var. plukenetii, commonly known as the Plukenet's shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus Aspidium.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy, and often serrated fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>The varietal distinction is primarily based on subtle differences in frond morphology and habitat preference compared to the typical form of Aspidium aculeatum.</p>
