<p>Amyema villiflora subsp.</p>
<p>villiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost-gum, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spindly growth habit and its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh environments.</p>
