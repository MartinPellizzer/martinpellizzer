                    <h1>Acacia spirocarpa var. major</h1>
<p>Acacia spirocarpa var. major, commonly known as the large-flowered acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often reduced to spines in mature plants, and its yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant produces flat, woody pods that contain seeds with tufts of silky hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots and a capacity to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria.</p>
<p>This acacia is often used in revegetation projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
