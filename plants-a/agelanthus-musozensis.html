<p>Agelanthus musozensis, commonly known as the Musozense cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, a feature typical of cycads, and it has a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Agelanthus musozensis is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique botanical species.</p>
