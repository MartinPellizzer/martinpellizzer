                <h1>Achyronia cytisoides</h1>
<p>Achyronia cytisoides, commonly known as the yellow flame tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and showy yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular ornamental plant due to its striking floral display and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia cytisoides has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are yellow, clustered in racemes, and consist of five petals with a long, slender corolla, blooming in spring and being pollinated by bees. The fruit is a slender legume pod that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are taproots that anchor the plant firmly in the soil and help it absorb nutrients from deep within the ground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia cytisoides is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and along riverbanks. It is also known to occur in parts of the Caribbean, including the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes humid lowland forests and disturbed areas with rich soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia cytisoides was mainly introduced to control erosion and for ornamental purposes in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides where it thrives in full sun. This plant has become invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its seeds are easily dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across new habitats.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to alter local ecosystems.</p>
