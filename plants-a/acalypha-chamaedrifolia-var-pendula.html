                        <h1>Acalypha chamaedrifolia var. pendula</h1>
<p>Acalypha chamaedrifolia var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping copperleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous growth habit, with long, drooping stems that bear clusters of small, copper-colored bracts. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by the showy bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its distinctive foliage and unique growth form.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha chamaedrifolia var. pendula is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. It is commonly associated with lowland and hill forest ecosystems, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these habitats. The varietal form, pendula, is distinguished by its hanging or drooping inflorescences, which are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has also been introduced to other tropical regions outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha chamaedrifolia var. pendula was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, cascading foliage. The plant has since spread beyond cultivation and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
