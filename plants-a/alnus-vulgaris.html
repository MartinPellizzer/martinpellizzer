                    <h1>Alnus vulgaris</h1>
<p>Alnus vulgaris, commonly known as the European black alder, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, shiny bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins that are pollinated by wind, and it relies on nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules to enrich the soil. Alnus vulgaris thrives in moist, often wet habitats such as stream sides and marshes.</p>
<p>Its ability to grow in poor soil conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
