                <h1>Adenoropium divaricatum</h1>
<p>Adenoropium divaricatum, commonly known as the variable orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its leaves are elongated and slightly hairy, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Adenoropium divaricatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoropium divaricatum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoropium divaricatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth habitats. Its natural range includes parts of Malaysia and Papua New Guinea as well.</p>
<p>Adenoropium divaricatum is an important component of the understory vegetation in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoropium divaricatum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and abandoned lands.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant has a rapid growth rate and can spread aggressively through vegetative propagation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is often found in urban and agricultural landscapes.</p>
