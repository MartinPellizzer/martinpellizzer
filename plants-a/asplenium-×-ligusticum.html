                    <h1>Asplenium × ligusticum</h1>
<p>Asplenium × ligusticum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium ligusticum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, and it exhibits a complex life cycle involving both sporophytic and gametophytic stages.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
