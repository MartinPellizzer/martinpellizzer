The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
