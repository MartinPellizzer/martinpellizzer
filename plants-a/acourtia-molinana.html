                <h1>Acourtia molinana</h1>
<p>Acourtia molinana, commonly known as the Molina's acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, linear leaves. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Acourtia molinana is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia molinana has small, oblanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and have a pale yellow color, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and dry environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia molinana is primarily native to Honduras.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. It is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>Acourtia molinana plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia molinana was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and valleys with a Mediterranean climate. This plant has been documented in several counties along the coast, including San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in these regions.</p>
