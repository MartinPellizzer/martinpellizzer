<p>Aulomyrcia dealbata, commonly known as the white-flowered cypress, is a species of coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and its cones are woody and contain seeds. Aulomyrcia dealbata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant form and seasonal color changes.</p>
<p>However, it is relatively rare in the wild and faces threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
