<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, inedible fruits that resemble kiwifruit but have a hairy, tough skin. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible berries. It produces fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the fruiting season in late summer.</p>
<p>Actinidia arguta is also valued for its ability to climb and its use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia arguta has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, and are arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–10 cm long and 3–6 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher and more fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small vine. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and borne in clusters, with separate male and female flowers on different plants, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
