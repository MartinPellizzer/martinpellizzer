                <h1>Actinidia trichogyna</h1>
<p>Actinidia trichogyna, commonly known as the fuzzy Actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that ripen to a bright red color in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia trichogyna has compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with ovate to elliptic leaflets, typically 5â€“9 cm long, and a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, with smooth, green bark that becomes rough and fissured with age, and it grows as a climbing vine with tendrils. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in terminal panicles, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a fuzzy, yellowish to orange berry that matures in late summer, and it is dispersed by birds and animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, spreading horizontally to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia trichogyna is primarily native to China South-Central and China Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in temperate climates with moist, well-drained soil. The plant is often associated with forest understory habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of southern and central China where the climate supports its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia trichogyna was mainly introduced to New Zealand and parts of Australia as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and berries.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivation and is now considered a potential weed in some regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and can colonize forest understories. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it a concern for native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and minimize its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
