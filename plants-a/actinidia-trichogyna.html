                <h1>Actinidia trichogyna</h1>
<p>Actinidia trichogyna, commonly known as the fuzzy fruit vine, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, round fruits that turn from green to red as they ripen, typically in late summer. Actinidia trichogyna is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and unique fruit.</p>
<p>It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia trichogyna has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern through twining. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and have a unique structure with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, yellowish berry that matures in late summer, containing multiple seeds, and it is dispersed primarily by birds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's climbing habit and anchoring it to support structures.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia trichogyna is a species of flowering plant native to eastern China, specifically the provinces of Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Hubei.</p>
<p>While it was once thought to be extinct, it is now known to have a limited current distribution in the wild, primarily in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in humid, temperate environments with well-drained soil, typically found in dense forests or along stream banks. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat loss, Actinidia trichogyna is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinidia trichogyna is a deciduous vine known for its edible, nutrient-rich fruit and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth occurring in spring and summer, followed by fruit ripening in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires consistent moisture, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after fruiting promote healthy growth, while common pests include aphids and fruit borers, and diseases like powdery mildew may occur in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinidia trichogyna is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil quality and offering habitat for birds and small mammals.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
