<p>Athyrium jieguishanense, commonly known as the Jiegushan holly fern, is a rare fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a dark green hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
