                <h1>Achillea mucronata</h1>
<p>Achillea mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers.</p>
<p>Achillea mucronata is often used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea mucronata has compound, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 6 inches in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age, growing in a bushy pattern. Its flowers are flat-topped clusters (compound umbels) of small, white to pale yellow petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to the feathery appendage.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea mucronata is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Oregon and Nevada. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, hillsides, and disturbed areas. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea mucronata was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its bright yellow flowers attracting pollinators. However, it has been reported to spread aggressively in some regions, potentially outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems in non-native habitats.</p>
