                <h1>Acilepis silhetensis</h1>
<p>Acilepis silhetensis, commonly known as the Silhet mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern regions of Bangladesh.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its leaves are lanceolate and hairy, while its stems are erect and often branched.</p>
<p>Acilepis silhetensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis silhetensis has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and vary in size from 5 to 12 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis silhetensis is primarily native to Assam, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China South-Central, East Himalaya, India, Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. The plant is known for its unique morphological features and ecological significance in its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution highlights its adaptation to diverse habitats across South and Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis silhetensis was mainly introduced to the northeastern regions of Bangladesh, particularly in the districts of Comilla and Sunamganj.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats such as undergrowth in evergreen forests. The plant is valued for its ornamental leaves and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant. It has also been reported in some parts of India, especially in Assam and West Bengal.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been documented in several botanical surveys focusing on native and introduced flora in the region.</p>
