<p>Anathallis nectarifera, commonly known as the nectar-producing anathallis, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hanging stems and small, greenish-white flowers that emit a sweet nectar to attract specific pollinators. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its unique floral structure and nectar production make it an important species in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
<p>Anathallis nectarifera is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
