<p>Aspidium triangulum var. tridens, commonly known as the three-toothed water fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental foliage.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
