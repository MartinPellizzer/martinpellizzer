<p>Aniseia barlerioides, commonly known as the desert aster, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Aniseia barlerioides plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
