                    <h1>Achillea millefolium</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system and upright, branched stems that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters called umbels. Its feathery, finely divided leaves are a distinguishing feature, contributing to its common name "millefolium," which means "thousand leaves" in Latin.</p>
<p>Yarrow is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and it has a long history of use in traditional medicine.</p>
