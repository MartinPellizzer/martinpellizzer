<p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, fern-like leaves and flat clusters of small, white or pink flowers. Native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Its name is derived from the Greek myth of Achilles, who supposedly used it to treat wounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium has leaves that are finely divided, feather-like, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, branched, and has a rough, hairy texture, typically ranging from light green to reddish-brown in color. Its flowers are composite, consisting of small yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from early summer to late summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, allowing the seeds to be dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, enabling the plant to spread vegetatively and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa.</p>
