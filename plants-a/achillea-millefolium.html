                <h1>Achillea millefolium</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system and upright, branched stems that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters called umbels. Its feathery, finely divided leaves are a distinguishing feature, contributing to its common name "millefolium," which means "thousand leaves" in Latin.</p>
<p>Yarrow is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and it has a long history of use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium has leaves that are finely divided, feather-like, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a length typically ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-green color, growing in a clumping pattern. Its flowers are white to light yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from early summer to mid-fall, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It has a wide current distribution and is now found in North America, South America, and Australia, often introduced through human activity.
