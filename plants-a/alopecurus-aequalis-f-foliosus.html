                    <h1>Alopecurus aequalis f. foliosus</h1>
<p>Alopecurus aequalis f. foliosus, commonly known as the hairy vernal grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, disturbed soils. The plant typically blooms in late spring with small, greenish-white spikelets that are clustered in panicles. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found along the edges of ponds, ditches, and marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
