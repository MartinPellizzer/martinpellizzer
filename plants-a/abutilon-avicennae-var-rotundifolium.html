                        <h1>Abutilon avicennae var. rotundifolium</h1>
<p>Abutilon avicennae var. rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf cottonwood, is a variant of the cottonwood plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in wetland or riparian environments. The plant is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fibrous蒴果 (capsules) contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon avicennae var. rotundifolium is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. It is adapted to the harsh coastal climate, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>It is often seen growing in dune systems and along the edges of estuaries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon avicennae var. rotundifolium was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, wetlands, and disturbed sites due to its adaptability to moist environments. This plant is often considered an invasive species in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in areas where it establishes dense populations.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
