                <h1>Abutilon avicennae var. rotundifolium</h1>
<p>Abutilon avicennae var. rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf velvetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically green with a soft texture. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon avicennae var. rotundifolium has broad, rounded leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm in diameter, with a velvety texture and a deep green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is upright and has a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age. The flowers are pendulous, with five petals that are usually pale yellow or orange, and they bloom in late spring to early summer, relying on insect pollination, primarily by bees. The fruit is a hairy capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon avicennae var. rotundifolium is a plant native to the island of Madagascar, where it occurs in specific regions with particular ecological conditions.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native habitat, though it may be cultivated in other areas for ornamental purposes. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often found in moist, well-drained soils near rivers or in shaded undergrowth. This species typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon avicennae var. rotundifolium is a fast-growing, ornamental shrub known for its velvety leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil with regular watering during the growing season.</p>
<p>Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abutilon avicennae var. rotundifolium is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain agricultural settings, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing coastal and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
