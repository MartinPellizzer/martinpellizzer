                <h1>Adinandra apoensis</h1>
<p>Adinandra apoensis, commonly known as the Philippine white ironwood, is a rare and endemic tree species found in the mountainous regions of the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within primary forests, often reaching heights of up to 20 meters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, while its fruits are woody capsules containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Adinandra apoensis is considered critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra apoensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exhibits a slight ridged texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the rocky soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra apoensis is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country, particularly in the islands of Luzon, Mindanao, and Palawan. This plant typically grows in lowland and montane forest ecosystems. It thrives in areas with high humidity and moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>Adinandra apoensis is an important component of the local biodiversity in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra apoensis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique flower structure. Its introduction has been reported in several Pacific Island nations, including Hawaii and Tahiti.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
