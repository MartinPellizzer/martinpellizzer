<p>Adromischus casmithianus, commonly known as the Cape snowball, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the winter months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
