                <h1>Acrostichum chartaceum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum chartaceum, commonly known as the paper mulberry.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Moraceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and often have a waxy texture. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in traditional medicine and has various ecological roles in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum chartaceum has long, narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a distichous pattern, meaning they are opposite along the stem, and they are typically green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and smooth, with a light green or yellowish bark, and it grows in a clump-forming manner. The plant does not produce flowers; instead, it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in wet, swampy habitats.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum chartaceum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. This fern thrives in humid environments with high moisture levels and poor soil conditions. It is particularly widespread in countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and Cuba.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in these habitats by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum chartaceum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites where it can thrive in moist, sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, dunes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. This plant has become naturalized in various regions, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate salt spray make it a successful invader in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its spread can lead to ecological imbalances in native habitats.</p>
