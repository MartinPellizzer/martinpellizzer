                    <h1>Avena pubescens f. stenophylla</h1>
<p>Avena pubescens f. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf oat, is a botanically distinctive variant of the common oat.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and compact growth habit, which distinguish it from the typical oat species. This form exhibits a reduced leaf width and often displays a more upright stature, adapting to specific ecological niches. It is native to regions of Europe and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies.</p>
