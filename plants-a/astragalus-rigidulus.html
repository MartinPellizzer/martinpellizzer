<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open grasslands or along riverbanks. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to brown flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Astragalus rigidulus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
