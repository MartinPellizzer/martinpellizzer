                        <h1>Acacia citriodora</h1>
<p>Acacia citriodora, commonly known as lemon acacia, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its fragrant, lemon-scented leaves make it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Acacia citriodora is also valued for its ability to thrive in arid conditions and its use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia citriodora belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of a distinct root system and vascular tissue. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a diverse group of vascular plants, including ferns and horsetails, and is known for its varied morphological features. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by its complex floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which includes plants known for their legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, which is characterized by pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees commonly found in arid regions, known for their distinctive phyllodes and often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia citriodora, a specific type of acacia known for its aromatic properties and use in essential oils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia citriodora is primarily native to the Northern Territory and Queensland of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. The plant thrives in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the dry and warm climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of water and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia citriodora was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and for its timber and fuelwood value.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed sites, along roadsides, and in degraded lands across its introduced range. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas make it a useful species for land rehabilitation.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
