                <h1>Acranthera siamensis</h1>
<p>Acranthera siamensis, commonly known as the Siam grass-violet, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of clustered flowers with five petals.</p>
<p>Acranthera siamensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera siamensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, clustered in racemes, and bloom during the rainy season, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the moist, well-drained soils where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera siamensis is primarily native to Thailand.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in forested areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within the understory of tropical rainforests. The plant is known for its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera siamensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has been observed in countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant's introduction is likely due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. It is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections for its attractive foliage and flowering habits.</p>
<p>However, its spread outside its native range is limited due to specific climatic and ecological requirements.</p>
