                <h1>Acer denticulatum</h1>
<p>Acer denticulatum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely toothed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 6â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained soil and partial shade. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The tree is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a landscape specimen.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer denticulatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a finely toothed margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, typically 5-10 cm long, and change from bright green in summer to vibrant red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender and erect, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer denticulatum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>Although its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America and Europe, where it is often cultivated in botanical gardens. This species thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil, typically growing in forested areas or along stream banks. It is found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, Acer denticulatum is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer denticulatum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves rapid growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowers or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support biodiversity in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer denticulatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its deep roots help prevent erosion, making it valuable for land restoration projects.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a wide range of plant and animal life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer denticulatum is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been traditionally used in Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. The tree contributes to local economies through timber and ornamental horticulture, supporting industries that rely on its aesthetic appeal. Culturally, it holds symbolic meaning in traditional Chinese art and literature, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in biodiversity and habitat support further highlights its ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer denticulatum has several popular cultivars that are highly valued in horticulture, such as 'Kosterman' and 'Red Sunset', known for their vibrant fall colors and compact growth.</p>
<p>These cultivars are often used in gardens and landscapes due to their ornamental appeal. Hybrids of Acer denticulatum have also been developed to enhance traits like disease resistance and cold hardiness. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in various soil conditions and its contribution to autumn foliage displays.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer denticulatum and its varieties play a significant role in both ornamental gardening and ecological landscapes.</p>
