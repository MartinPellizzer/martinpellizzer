                <h1>Acronia sphaerantha</h1>
<p>Acronia sphaerantha, commonly known as the globe acronia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, spherical flower heads that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Acronia sphaerantha is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia sphaerantha has small, round, succulent leaves that are clustered at the base of the plant, forming a rosette shape, with a bluish-green color and a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly hairy. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and yellowish-white, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia sphaerantha is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of swamps. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with abundant moisture. It is often associated with coastal areas and can be found in both natural and disturbed wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific environmental requirements, its distribution is relatively limited to these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia sphaerantha was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. It is often associated with areas that have a high level of humidity and cool temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens and naturalized in some parts of its range.</p>
