                <h1>Adenia harmandii</h1>
<p>Adenia harmandii, commonly known as the Harmand's adenium, is a striking succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and distinctive, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces striking, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a dramatic visual element to its appearance. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its swollen stems to survive prolonged dry periods.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and resilience, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia harmandii has compound, pinnate leaves that are typically elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring five petals that are pink to red in color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, helping the plant to store nutrients and survive in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia harmandii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, specifically found in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments within lowland and montane forests. This plant is commonly found in the understorey of dense vegetation, where it benefits from the humidity and partial light conditions. Its distribution is closely linked to the presence of specific soil types and climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Adenia harmandii plays an important ecological role in these forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia harmandii was mainly introduced to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas where the climate is humid and warm. This plant has been introduced for its ornamental value due to its attractive, waxy leaves and unique floral structure. It thrives in shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become an invasive species in certain ecosystems.</p>
