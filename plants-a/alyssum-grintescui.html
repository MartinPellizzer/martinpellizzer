<p>Alyssum grintescui, commonly known as the silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Alyssum grintescui is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
