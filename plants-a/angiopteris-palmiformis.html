                    <h1>Angiopteris palmiformis</h1>
<p>Angiopteris palmiformis, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, palm-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance, making it a striking addition to wetland ecosystems.</p>
