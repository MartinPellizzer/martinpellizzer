                    <h1>Asplenium × flagrum</h1>
<p>Asplenium × flagrum, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium ruta-muraria.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>While it does not produce spores, it is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of cultivation.</p>
