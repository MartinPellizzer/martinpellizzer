<p>Asplenium biscaynianum, commonly known as the Biscaynian spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium biscaynianum is a relatively rare species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
