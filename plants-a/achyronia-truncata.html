                <h1>Achyronia truncata</h1>
<p>Achyronia truncata, commonly known as the dwarf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Achyronia truncata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia truncata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered with a smooth, light gray bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia truncata is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy or gravelly soils. This plant thrives in open habitats such as plains, grasslands, and disturbed areas. It is adapted to hot, dry climates and can withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic regions within the southwestern part of the country.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia truncata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was initially brought in for its ornamental value due to its unique leaf structure and ability to thrive in shaded environments. The plant has since spread beyond its original introduction sites, particularly in moist, forested areas. Its establishment has raised concerns among local ecologists due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and minimize its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
