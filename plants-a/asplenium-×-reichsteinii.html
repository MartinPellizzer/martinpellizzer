                    <h1>Asplenium × reichsteinii</h1>
<p>Asplenium × reichsteinii, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, though it does not produce viable seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
