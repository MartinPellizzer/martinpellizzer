                <h1>Aciotis ornata</h1>
<p>Aciotis ornata, commonly known as the Mexican sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant orange to yellow flower heads and lance-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, producing showy blooms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis ornata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that exhibits a creeping growth pattern, often spreading along the ground. Its flowers are daisy-like, composed of white ray florets surrounding yellow disc florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis ornata is primarily native to Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and disturbed areas. Aciotis ornata is well adapted to the warm and humid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis ornata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue-green foliage and yellow flowers. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas into natural habitats, raising concerns about its invasive potential. It thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation in wetland and riparian zones.</p>
<p>Monitoring and management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate ecological impacts.</p>
