                <h1>Achyrocoma tomentosa</h1>
<p>Achyrocoma tomentosa, commonly known as the silver leaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fuzzy, silver-gray foliage and daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for gardeners.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocoma tomentosa has small, rounded, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, which are short and branching, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly rough to the touch. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers with five petals, blooming in spring and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocoma tomentosa is primarily native to the Andes Mountains of South America, specifically in countries such as Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 3,000 and 5,000 meters above sea level. This plant is commonly found in rocky areas and among alpine vegetation. It is well adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocoma tomentosa was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and dry forests. The plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in disturbed soils and can spread through seeds carried by wind or water.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
