<p>Acacia lophantha var. neumannii, commonly known as the Neumann's wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
