<p>It features fine, dark green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and other wet areas. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
