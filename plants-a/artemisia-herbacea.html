<p>Artemisia herbacea, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters during the summer months. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many other aromatic herbs and flowering plants.</p>
<p>Artemisia herbacea is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils due to its strong, distinctive scent.</p>
