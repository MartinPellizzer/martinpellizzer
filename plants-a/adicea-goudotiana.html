                <h1>Adicea goudotiana</h1>
<p>Adicea goudotiana, commonly known as the Goudot's adicea, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Adicea goudotiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea goudotiana has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains thin throughout the plant's growth. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea goudotiana is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the central and eastern regions of the island. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. It is commonly associated with humid, tropical climates.</p>
<p>Adicea goudotiana is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea goudotiana was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Australia. The plant's introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils contribute to its spread.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and manage its distribution to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
