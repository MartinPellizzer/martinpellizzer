                <h1>Acokanthera schimperi</h1>
<p>Acokanthera schimperi, commonly known as the African arrow poison or poison arrow tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which contains potent cardiac glycosides. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it has been historically used by indigenous peoples for hunting and traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acokanthera schimperi has simple, alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically gray to brown in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming from July to September, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera schimperi is primarily native to Djibouti, DR Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Socotra, Somalia, Tanzania, Uganda, Yemen.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in dry savannas and woodlands. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, which are common in its native range. The species is known for its toxic properties and has cultural and medicinal significance in many of these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans across parts of East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera schimperi was mainly introduced to regions of East Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania, as a source of medicinal compounds.</p>
<p>It is valued for its toxic alkaloids, which have been traditionally used in various cultural and medicinal practices. The plant is often found in dry savanna and woodland habitats, growing in well-drained soils. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential ecological impact and the risk of invasiveness in new environments.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent unintended spread and negative effects on native flora.</p>
