                <h1>Acronychia montana</h1>
<p>Acronychia montana, commonly known as the mountain acronychia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits. Acronychia montana is typically found in rainforest or wet tropical environments, where it thrives in shaded, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia montana has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in inflorescences, and they bloom during the wet season, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, elongated seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, contributing to its stability in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia montana is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. The plant is commonly distributed in the eastern and western parts of New Guinea, including both the mainland and some of the larger islands. It grows in lowland to mid-elevation areas, often in primary forest habitats.</p>
<p>Acronychia montana is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia montana was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of eastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in the mild, temperate climate. This plant is often associated with coastal dunes and sandplain habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil. Its introduction has been largely accidental, through seed dispersal by wind or water.</p>
<p>Despite being non-native, it has become naturalized in these areas and is now considered part of the local coastal flora.</p>
