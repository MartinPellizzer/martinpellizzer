                    <h1>Aerangis carusiana</h1>
<p>Aerangis carusiana, commonly known as the Carusian orchid, is a tropical orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting to its humid, tropical environment. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
