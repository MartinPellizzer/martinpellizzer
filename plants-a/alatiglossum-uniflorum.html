<p>Alatiglossum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower alatiglossum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, solitary flower that emerges from a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help to retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance.</p>
