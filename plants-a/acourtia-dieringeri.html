                <h1>Acourtia dieringeri</h1>
<p>Acourtia dieringeri, commonly known as the Dieringer's acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Acourtia dieringeri is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia dieringeri has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows in a creeping or upright manner depending on environmental conditions. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia dieringeri is primarily native to Mexico Northeast and Mexico Northwest.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at higher elevations. The species is part of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific regions in Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia dieringeri was mainly introduced to coastal areas of California and Oregon, where it thrives in sandy and gravelly soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dunes and disturbed sites along the Pacific coast. This plant is often spread by wind due to its lightweight seeds, which can travel long distances. It has become naturalized in several regions, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
