                    <h1>Arundo donaciformis</h1>
<p>Arundo donaciformis, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features hollow, bamboo-like stems that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as riverbanks and marshes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
