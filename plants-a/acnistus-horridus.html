                <h1>Acnistus horridus</h1>
<p>Acnistus horridus, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet, characterized by its spiny stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and livestock, are bright red and appear in the fall.</p>
<p>Acnistus horridus is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus horridus has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody, and covered with rough, ridged bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus horridus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Asia, including India and Sri Lanka, as well as in the Pacific Islands like Madagascar and the Philippines. This plant typically grows in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to areas with warm climates and adequate sunlight.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus horridus was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in various conditions.</p>
<p>It has since become invasive in several regions, particularly in the southeastern states, where it outcompetes native vegetation. The plant's rapid growth and seed dispersal contribute to its spread across disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, as it can alter local ecosystems and reduce biodiversity.</p>
<p>Management efforts often focus on controlling its spread through mechanical removal and herbicides.</p>
