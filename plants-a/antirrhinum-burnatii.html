<p>Antirrhinum burnatii, commonly known as the Burnatii snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Antirrhinum burnatii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>
