<p>Anabasis aphylla subsp.</p>
<p>australis, commonly known as the coastal sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its fleshy, silver-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland saline areas.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and salt makes it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
