                    <h1>Astephanus urceolatus</h1>
<p>Astephanus urceolatus, commonly known as the cup-shaped lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a distinctive, cup-like structure.</p>
<p>It typically grows on soil, rocks, or decaying wood in temperate and boreal regions. The thallus is composed of a dense, leathery layer of fungal hyphae intertwined with algal cells. It has a pale to dark green or brown coloration, depending on the species and environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants.</p>
