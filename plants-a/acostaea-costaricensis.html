                <h1>Acostaea costaricensis</h1>
<p>Acostaea costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican marsh fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Central America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating, contributing to its ornamental appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Acostaea costaricensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acostaea costaricensis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbel-like inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acostaea costaricensis is primarily native to Central America, specifically Costa Rica and Panama.</p>
<p>It is found in humid lowland forests and cloud forests at elevations ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity. It is commonly associated with understory vegetation in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within these countries due to its ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acostaea costaricensis was mainly introduced to the Americas through human activity, particularly as a result of horticultural trade and intentional cultivation.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Central and South America. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often near water bodies or in dense vegetation. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native areas, where it can compete with native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
