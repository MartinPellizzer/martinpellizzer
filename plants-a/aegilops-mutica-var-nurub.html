                    <h1>Aegilops mutica var. nurub</h1>
<p>Aegilops mutica var. nurub, commonly known as the rough wild barley, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brown glumes and lemma-like bracts. Its seeds are typically small and hard, adapted for dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic relationship to cultivated barley and its potential for agricultural improvement.</p>
