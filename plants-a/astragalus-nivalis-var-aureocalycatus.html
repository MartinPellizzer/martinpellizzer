                    <h1>Astragalus nivalis var. aureocalycatus</h1>
<p>Astragalus nivalis var. aureocalycatus, commonly known as the golden-calyx snow lotus, is a rare alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-white flowers and hairy, mat-forming foliage adapted to cold, arid environments. The plant thrives in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters, where it withstands harsh climatic conditions. Its small, pod-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in remote habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
