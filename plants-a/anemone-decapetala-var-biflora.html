                    <h1>Anemone decapetala var. biflora</h1>
<p>Anemone decapetala var. biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters of two, giving it its common name. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are basal and often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral morphology and its role in pollinator ecosystems.</p>
