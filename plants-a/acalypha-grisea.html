<p>It is characterized by its grayish-green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often toxic species. Acalypha grisea typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and horticultural applications.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha grisea has simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and reddish-brown in color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pale green to yellowish petals and stamen, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind after maturity.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha grisea is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed habitats like forests, shrublands, and roadside areas. This species thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil and prefers altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Despite its wide distribution, Acalypha grisea is considered a least concern species by the IUCN Red List due to its adaptability and stable population trends.</p>
