                <h1>Adenogyne discolor</h1>
<p>Adenogyne discolor, commonly known as the spotted adenogyne, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other related species. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that are typically pink or white with contrasting spots. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adenogyne discolor is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenogyne discolor has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and reddish-brown in color, with a branching growth pattern that allows it to form dense clusters. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions by storing water efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogyne discolor is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. This plant thrives in humid, lowland rainforest environments. It is often associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogyne discolor was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Oregon in the early 2000s. The plant has since spread to parts of Washington and British Columbia. It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Its introduction is believed to be due to accidental seed dispersal through human activity.</p>
