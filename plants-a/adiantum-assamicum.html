                <h1>Adiantum assamicum</h1>
<p>Adiantum assamicum, commonly known as the Assam maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern native to the northeastern regions of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum assamicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum assamicum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feather-like appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green, glossy, and have a slender, upright arrangement. The plant has a short, unbranched stem with smooth, light brown bark.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum assamicum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in moist, shaded environments like forests and rocky areas. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often associated with mountainous terrain. It is also present in parts of China and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes both terrestrial and epiphytic growth forms.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum assamicum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures, making it suitable for temperate climates. This plant is commonly found in the northeastern parts of India, particularly in states like Assam and West Bengal. Its introduction to new areas has been largely due to human activity, including horticultural trade and accidental dispersal.</p>
<p>It is valued for its delicate fronds and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
