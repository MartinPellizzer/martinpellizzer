<p>Arabis tilingii, commonly known as the Turkish rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with distinctive four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for alpine environments. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid surroundings.</p>
