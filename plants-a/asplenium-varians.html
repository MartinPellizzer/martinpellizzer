<p>Asplenium varians, commonly known as the variable spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into smaller lobes. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium varians is often found on rocks or in crevices, thriving in humid, temperate climates.</p>
