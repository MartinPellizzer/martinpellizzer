                    <h1>Amyema miraculosa</h1>
<p>Amyema miraculosa, commonly known as the miraculous lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It forms a composite structure where the alga provides photosynthetic capability, while the fungus offers protection and moisture retention. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its growth is slow, and it can live for decades, making it a resilient yet rare species.</p>
<p>The organism plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and habitat provision for microorganisms.</p>
