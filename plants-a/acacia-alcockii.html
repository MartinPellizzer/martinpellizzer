                    <h1>Acacia alcockii</h1>
<p>Acacia alcockii, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. Acacia alcockii is adapted to survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it a notable species in its native habitat.</p>
