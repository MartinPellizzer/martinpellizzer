<p>Alaticaulia bennettii, commonly known as the Bennett's alpine shrub, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>

The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Alaticaulia bennettii plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
