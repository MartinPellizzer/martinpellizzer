                    <h1>Agrostis microsperma</h1>
<p>Agrostis microsperma, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and lawns. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are minute, which contributes to its ability to spread readily in various environments.</p>
<p>Agrostis microsperma is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
