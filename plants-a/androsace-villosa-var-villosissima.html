                    <h1>Androsace villosa var. villosissima</h1>
<p>Androsace villosa var. villosissima, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing alpine plant characterized by its dense, soft, white to grayish pubescence covering its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often found in mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine, silky hairs that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its hirsute appearance and its ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments.</p>
