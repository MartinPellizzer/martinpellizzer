                    <h1>Anisophyllum cordatum</h1>
<p>Anisophyllum cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf buckler-fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, heart-shaped fronds that are typically 15â€“30 cm long, with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, round clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
