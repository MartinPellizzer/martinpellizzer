                    <h1>Allocarya leptoclada</h1>
<p>Allocarya leptoclada, commonly known as the slender-stemmed lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, leaf-like thallus with a distinct upper and lower surface. The upper surface is typically smooth and covered with a layer of wax, while the lower surface contains the symbiotic fungal and algal components. It is often found on bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This lichen plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality in its habitat.</p>
