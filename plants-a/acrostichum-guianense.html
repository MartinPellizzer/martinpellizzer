                <h1>Acrostichum guianense</h1>
<p>Acrostichum guianense, commonly known as the Guianan brake, is a fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The fronds are used in traditional medicine and are also valued for their ornamental appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum guianense has large, pinnate leaves that are typically triangular in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spadices, usually pale green to white in color, blooming during the wet season and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a three-lobed, three-chambered capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after ripening.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in moist, swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum guianense is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, lowland areas, including riverbanks and swampy forests. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with mangrove and coastal ecosystems. It is also present in parts of northern Brazil and Venezuela.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wetland habitats, it plays an important role in the ecological balance of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum guianense was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has been established in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as along roadsides, in abandoned fields, and near water bodies. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes contribute to its invasive potential in these areas.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is still limited compared to other invasive species in the same ecological zones.</p>
