                <h1>Actephila dolichantha</h1>
<p>Actephila dolichantha, commonly known as the long-stalked actephila, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with four petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila dolichantha has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a deep green color and slightly hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a rough, bark-like texture that is typically grayish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a white to pale pink color, blooming during the spring to early summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds through wind, with the seeds being small, dry, and equipped with tiny wings for easy transport.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila dolichantha is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rainforests and secondary growth habitats. It is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is relatively limited compared to other species in the same genus.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila dolichantha was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and clearings.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
