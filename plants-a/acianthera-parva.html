                <h1>Acianthera parva</h1>
<p>Acianthera parva, commonly known as the dwarf violet orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. The plant features delicate, hairy stems and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and white. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>Acianthera parva is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera parva has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a light green bark that is smooth and slightly fibrous, and it grows in a creeping or ascending pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale pink, with a single lip-like petal and a tubular shape, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by bees and other small insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera parva is primarily native to Brazil South and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the Atlantic Forest biome. The plant is commonly found in forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific regions within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera parva was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant's introduction is often associated with the cultivation of orchids and other ornamental species. Due to its adaptability, it has established populations in diverse environments, sometimes becoming invasive.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are being considered to manage its spread and mitigate potential ecological impacts.</p>
