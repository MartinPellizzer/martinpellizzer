                    <h1>Asplenium miradorense</h1>
<p>Asplenium miradorense, commonly known as the Mirador fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Panama.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in rocky crevices. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Asplenium miradorense is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
