                    <h1>Alsophila decrescens var. hirsutifolia</h1>
<p>Alsophila decrescens var. hirsutifolia, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a dense, hairy layer of remnants from its fronds. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>The varietal name "hirsutifolia" refers to its distinctive hairy foliage, which sets it apart from other members of the Alsophila genus.</p>
