                <h1>Acorus humilis</h1>
<p>Acorus humilis, commonly known as narrow-leaf sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous stem, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is often found in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acorus humilis is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus humilis has narrow, grass-like leaves that are sword-shaped, arranged in a rosette pattern, and typically range from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, with a bright green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and rhizomatous, with a smooth, pale yellowish-brown bark that grows horizontally underground. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, arranged in a spadix surrounded by a pale green spathe, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed berry that turns dark purple, and the seeds are dispersed by water and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomes that spread horizontally, helping the plant to colonize wetland areas effectively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus humilis is primarily native to the eastern United States, including regions such as Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant is also present in parts of southeastern Canada, particularly in Ontario and Quebec. It prefers moist to saturated soil conditions and is commonly associated with freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Acorus humilis plays an important ecological role in these ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus humilis was mainly introduced to wetland and aquatic environments where it thrives in shallow water and moist soil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of lakes. This plant is known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions, making it adaptable to various habitats. Its presence can sometimes lead to ecological changes by outcompeting native species for resources.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is often monitored in regions where it has been introduced.</p>
