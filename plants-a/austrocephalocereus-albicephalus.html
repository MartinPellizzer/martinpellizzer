                    <h1>Austrocephalocereus albicephalus</h1>
<p>Austrocephalocereus albicephalus, commonly known as the white-headed cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of southern South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. This plant is characterized by its tall, columnar stems covered in white, woolly spines that give it its distinctive appearance. The flowers, which appear at the top of the stems, are typically yellow or pale green and bloom during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
