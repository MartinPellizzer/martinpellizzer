                <h1>Adesmia subnuda</h1>
<p>Adesmia subnuda, commonly known as the naked-stemmed burr vine, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Leguminosae family, characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its stems are often hairy, and the leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Adesmia subnuda is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia subnuda has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dull green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a slightly hairy texture and a light green to brownish bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, featuring five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, smooth seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and aiding in the plant's survival in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia subnuda is primarily native to Bolivia and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean regions of these countries. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is well adapted to the high-altitude environments of the Andes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia subnuda was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, grazing lands, and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is often found in temperate climates, particularly in South America, where it has been documented in several countries. Its introduction is likely due to human activities, including accidental seed dispersal through agricultural practices.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
