                <h1>Adenophora stenophylla</h1>
<p>Adenophora stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Adenophora stenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora stenophylla has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and covered with fine hairs, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and range in color from pale blue to purple, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
