                    <h1>Arundo spiculorum</h1>
<p>Arundo spiculorum, commonly known as the spiculate reed, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
