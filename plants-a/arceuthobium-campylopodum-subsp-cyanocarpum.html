<p>Arceuthobium campylopodum subsp.</p>
<p>cyanocarpum, commonly known as the blue-fruited witchgrass, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, thread-like stems and tiny, blue-black fruits.</p>
<p>The plant is typically found growing on the roots of various grasses and forbs, particularly in disturbed soils. Its reproductive strategy involves the dispersal of seeds through wind, which can lead to the establishment of new colonies.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited host range, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat.</p>
