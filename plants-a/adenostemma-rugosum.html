                <h1>Adenostemma rugosum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma rugosum, commonly known as rough adenostemma, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Adenostemma rugosum is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma rugosum has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually hairy and range in size from 2 to 6 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, slightly woody, and have a rough, ridged texture, often appearing reddish-brown in color. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with tubular corollas that are pink to red in color, blooming from summer to early autumn and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma rugosum is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, shrublands, and along roadsides in these regions. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in well-drained soils. It is particularly common in the eastern and western parts of South Africa.</p>
<p>Adenostemma rugosum is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma rugosum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and full sunlight. The plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It has been documented in several states, including Texas and Louisiana, where it establishes quickly in disturbed environments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate various soil conditions contribute to its spread as an invasive species in these regions.</p>
