                    <h1>Actaea × ludovicii</h1>
<p>Actaea × ludovicii, commonly known as the red baneberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Actaea rubra and Actaea pachypoda.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, red, poisonous berries that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of forests and thrives in temperate climates. Its foliage consists of compound leaves with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
