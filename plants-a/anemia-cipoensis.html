                    <h1>Anemia cipoensis</h1>
<p>Anemia cipoensis, commonly known as the Cipoan fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the humid rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Anemia cipoensis is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying tropical flora.</p>
