                        <h1>Abildgaardia microcephala</h1>
<p>Abildgaardia microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a unique species native to the island of Sardinia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form. The plant features a thick, unbranched trunk with a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. Its reproductive structures include cones, typical of cycads, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia microcephala is primarily native to the island of Sardinia, Italy.</p>
<p>It is found in specific habitats within the Mediterranean region, particularly in rocky and coastal areas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the mild, temperate climate of the region. It is commonly found in open, sunny locations such as cliffs and coastal slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Sardinia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia microcephala was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, compact growth habit and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the early 20th century by horticultural enthusiasts and botanical collectors. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become a potential invasive species, spreading beyond cultivated gardens into native ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types have raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
<p>Efforts are now underway to monitor and control its spread to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
