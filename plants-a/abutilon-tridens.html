<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon tridens has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long and 2-4 cm wide, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age. Its flowers are pendulous, with five pointed lobes, and are typically yellow or orange, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant in its environment.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
