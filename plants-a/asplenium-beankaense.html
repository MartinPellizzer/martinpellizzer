<p>Asplenium beankaense, commonly known as the Beanka spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly glossy. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Asplenium genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
