                    <h1>Amphidonax</h1>
<p>Amphidonax, commonly known as the giant swallowtail butterfly, is not a plant but a species of butterfly.</p>
<p>However, it is closely associated with certain plants, particularly those in the citrus family, as its larvae feed on the leaves of these plants. The adult butterfly is often seen near these host plants, contributing to the ecological relationship between the insect and its plant hosts. While not a botanical subject itself, Amphidonax plays a significant role in pollination and ecosystem dynamics.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of healthy plant communities in its habitat.</p>
