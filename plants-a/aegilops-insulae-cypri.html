                <h1>Aegilops insulae-cypri</h1>
<p>Aegilops insulae-cypri, commonly known as Cyprus wild rye, is a grass species native to the island of Cyprus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops insulae-cypri has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a light green color and a somewhat hairy texture, growing upright with a branched structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spikes, which bloom in the spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>
