                    <h1>Aeschynanthus verticillatus</h1>
<p>Aeschynanthus verticillatus, commonly known as the hanging lantern plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in bright shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces showy, lantern-like bracts that enclose the actual flowers, giving it its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is popular in hanging baskets and as a trailing plant in greenhouses and indoor spaces.</p>
