<p>It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white trichomes, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
