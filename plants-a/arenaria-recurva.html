<p>Arenaria recurva, commonly known as the bent sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with succulent, often hairy leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Arenaria recurva plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
