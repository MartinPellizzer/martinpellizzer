                    <h1>Astragalus insularis var. pondii</h1>
<p>Astragalus insularis var. pondii, commonly known as the Pond's island milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or pale yellow flowers in late spring. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
