                <h1>Adelia segregata</h1>
<p>Adelia segregata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adelia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange in color. Adelia segregata grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia segregata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink and white, blooming in spring, and is pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia segregata is primarily native to the eastern and southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, wooded areas and along stream banks. This species thrives in the humid climate of the Appalachian region. It is also present in parts of the Ozark Mountains.</p>
<p>Adelia segregata is often associated with rich, acidic soils in these habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia segregata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and urban environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soil conditions. This plant has become invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in regions where it has established itself.</p>
<p>It is often found in temperate climates across Europe and parts of North America.</p>
