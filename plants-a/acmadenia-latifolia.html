                <h1>Acmadenia latifolia</h1>
<p>Acmadenia latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved acmadenia, is a shrub native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmadenia latifolia has simple, alternate, elliptical or ovate leaves that are generally broad and green, with a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The stems are slender and branched, with smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin layers. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom during autumn, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia latifolia is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal and mountainous regions of this area. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the Cape Provinces.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia latifolia was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Australia, as part of ecological restoration and revegetation projects.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and hinterland regions, thriving in sandy or loamy soils. The plant is valued for its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and spread.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its original range due to human activity and climate change.</p>
