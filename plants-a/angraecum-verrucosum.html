                    <h1>Angraecum verrucosum</h1>
<p>Angraecum verrucosum, commonly known as the hairy angraecum, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green pseudobulbs and long, pendant inflorescences bearing fragrant, white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by the Star-nosed Moth, which has a long proboscis adapted for this specific relationship.</p>
<p>Angraecum verrucosum is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and rarity.</p>
