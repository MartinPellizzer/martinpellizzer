                <h1>Adiantum schweinfurthii</h1>
<p>Adiantum schweinfurthii, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky areas. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, arching shape.</p>
<p>Adiantum schweinfurthii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum schweinfurthii has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feather-like appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green, with a light green to silver underside, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant has a slender, branching stem with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-yellow in color, blooming in the spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a spore-bearing capsule that disperses spores through wind, and the roots are fibrous, helping anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum schweinfurthii is primarily native to Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, DR Congo, Guinea, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan-South Sudan, Tanzania, and Togo.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. The plant is well adapted to the humid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic areas in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum schweinfurthii was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the United States and Canada, as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as gardens, stream banks, and forest floors. This plant has become established in certain regions, sometimes escaping cultivation and naturalizing in the wild. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes local flora.</p>
