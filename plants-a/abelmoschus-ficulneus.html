<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus ficulneus has simple, alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy surface, ranging in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes woody as the plant matures, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are yellow with five petals and a prominent yellow center, blooming in summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus ficulneus is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including Africa and the Americas, for its ornamental and edible qualities. This species thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil, often found in moist lowland areas near rivers or in open woodlands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, it is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status due to its widespread cultivation and natural habitat.</p>
