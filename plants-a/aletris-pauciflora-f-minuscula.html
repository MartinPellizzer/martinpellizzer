The plant produces delicate, white to pale green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in small inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in woodland areas with acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
