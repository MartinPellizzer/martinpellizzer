                    <h1>Asarca maculosa</h1>
<p>Asarca maculosa, commonly known as the spotted marsh-plantain, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10-30 centimeters and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple or reddish spotting. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the late summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>Asarca maculosa is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its habitat.</p>
