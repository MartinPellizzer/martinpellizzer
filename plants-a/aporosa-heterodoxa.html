                    <h1>Aporosa heterodoxa</h1>
<p>Aporosa heterodoxa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued in musical instrument making. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy appearance, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
