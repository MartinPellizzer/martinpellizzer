                    <h1>Acacia doratoxylon var. ovata</h1>
<p>Acacia doratoxylon var. ovata, commonly known as the desert acacia or white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system and the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia.</p>
<p>This species is often used in reforestation and soil stabilization projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
