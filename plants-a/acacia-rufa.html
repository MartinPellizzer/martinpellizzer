<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. Acacia rufa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant in dry climates.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and animal forage.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia rufa is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the states of Western Australia, South Australia, and parts of Queensland. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the harsh climate with its deep root system and waxy foliage.</p>
<p>Acacia rufa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia rufa was mainly introduced to areas with Mediterranean climates, characterized by dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for regions with mild temperatures. The plant is often found in coastal and inland regions where it can establish itself quickly due to its drought tolerance. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns as it can outcompete native vegetation in certain environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance.</p>
