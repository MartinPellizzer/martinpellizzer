<p>Acaena elegans, commonly known as the slender wood rose, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive bracts that resemble petals, which are often mistaken for flowers. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin.</p>
<p>Acaena elegans thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>

<p>It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the Patagonian area. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It is often associated with disturbed soils and can be found in coastal and inland areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the southern part of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena elegans was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
