The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in arid environments.</p>
