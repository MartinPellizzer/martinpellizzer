                    <h1>Achroanthes liliifolia</h1>
<p>Achroanthes liliifolia, commonly known as the white-flowered lily, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette at the base. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild.</p>
