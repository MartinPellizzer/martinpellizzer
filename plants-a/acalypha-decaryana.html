                        <h1>Acalypha decaryana</h1>
<p>Acalypha decaryana, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, red-veined leaves that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or understorey habitats.</p>
<p>The leaves are hairy and have a slightly toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha decaryana belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many species with distinctive floral structures and often show complex relationships. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse forms and some containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupweed," characterized by their often hairy leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha decaryana, a specific type within the genus Acalypha, known for its distinctive morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha decaryana is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions across the island, particularly in moist forested areas. This species thrives in humid and tropical climates, often growing in shaded undergrowth. It is an important part of the local flora and ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to Madagascar, with no known presence in other regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha decaryana was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the early 20th century by horticultural enthusiasts and later became popular in gardens and landscapes. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since naturalized in certain areas, raising concerns about its potential to become invasive. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to increased monitoring to prevent it from outcompeting native species in the ecosystem.</p>
