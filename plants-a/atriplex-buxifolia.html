                    <h1>Atriplex buxifolia</h1>
<p>Atriplex buxifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, rounded, wax-coated leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to saline and drought-prone soils, making it a valuable plant for soil stabilization in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of native plant communities in its habitat.</p>
