                    <h1>Agave hanburyi</h1>
<p>Agave hanburyi, commonly known as the Hanbury's agave, is a striking succulent native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with pale yellow to greenish flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Agave hanburyi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid environments.</p>
