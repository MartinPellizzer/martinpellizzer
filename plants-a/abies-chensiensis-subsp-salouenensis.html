<p>Abies chensiensis subsp.</p>
<p>salouenensis, commonly known as the Salouenensis fir, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the mountainous regions of eastern China. It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needle-like leaves, and a dense, pyramidal crown.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, typically found in high-altitude forests. Its bark is thin and smooth, often covered in a layer of moss, while its cones are small and typically hang downward.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
