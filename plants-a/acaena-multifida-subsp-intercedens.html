                        <h1>Acaena multifida subsp. intercedens</h1>
<p>Acaena multifida subsp.</p>
<p>intercedens, commonly known as the New Zealand thorned sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces achenes, which are dry, one-seeded fruits, and is often found in coastal and subalpine habitats. It has a creeping growth habit and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native range.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena multifida subsp.</p>
<p>intercedens is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in dry, open habitats such as tussock grasslands and rocky outcrops. It is commonly associated with the foothills and lower mountain areas.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena multifida subsp.</p>
<p>intercedens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European colonization efforts in the 19th century.</p>
<p>The plant was likely introduced intentionally for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some areas of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native ecosystems.</p>
