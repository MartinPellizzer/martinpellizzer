                    <h1>Arrhenatherum elatius f. pauciflorum</h1>
<p>Arrhenatherum elatius f. pauciflorum, commonly known as the sparse-flowered wood oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and in wet meadows. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its reduced flower number compared to the typical form, making it a notable botanical curiosity.</p>
