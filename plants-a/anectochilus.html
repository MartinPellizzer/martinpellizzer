                    <h1>Anectochilus</h1>
<p>Anectochilus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Anectochilus species typically have a single, slender stem with a few leaves and a single flower, making them highly distinctive.</p>
<p>Due to their specialized habitat requirements and limited distribution, these orchids are considered endangered in many regions.</p>
