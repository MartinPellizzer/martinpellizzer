<p>Austroblechnum penna-marina subsp.</p>
<p>alpinum, commonly known as the alpine cliff fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments where it attaches itself to vertical rock faces or cliffs.</p>
<p>The plant has a compact, upright growth habit with finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are adapted to withstand harsh weather conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Blechnaceae family.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution.</p>
