                    <h1>Astragalus barbatus</h1>
<p>Astragalus barbatus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and desert scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Astragalus barbatus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
