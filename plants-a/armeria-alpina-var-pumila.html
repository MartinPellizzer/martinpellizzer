                    <h1>Armeria alpina var. pumila</h1>
<p>Armeria alpina var. pumila, commonly known as the alpine thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often forming dense mats that stabilize rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>This hardy species is valued in rock gardens and alpine landscapes for its resilience and ornamental appeal.</p>
