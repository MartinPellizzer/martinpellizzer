<p>Agave ottonis, commonly known as the blue agave, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are blue-gray in color and covered in white powdery hairs. The plant produces a tall, branched flower stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Its rosette growth habit and ability to store water in its leaves make it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Agave ottonis is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
