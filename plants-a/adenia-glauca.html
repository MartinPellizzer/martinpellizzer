                <h1>Adenia glauca</h1>
<p>Adenia glauca, commonly known as the blue adenia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2â€“5 meters. The plant features smooth, greyish bark and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture.</p>
<p>Adenia glauca is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia glauca has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically glossy green on top and pale beneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is often grayish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a somewhat branched structure. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia glauca is primarily native to Botswana, Northern Provinces.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. This plant thrives in rocky and dry environments, often growing on cliffs or among sparse vegetation. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of the region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within the Northern Provinces of Botswana.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia glauca was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. The plant thrives in coastal and disturbed habitats, often along the edges of forests and on rocky outcrops. Its spread has been limited due to its preference for specific environmental conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native flora.</p>
