<p>Arachis villosulicarpa f. maior, commonly known as the hairy pod groundnut, is a botanical variant of the groundnut genus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, elongated pods and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained, sandy soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval and hairy on the underside.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential for genetic diversity.</p>
