                        <h1>Abies lasiocarpa f. conica</h1>
<p>Abies lasiocarpa f. conica, commonly known as the White fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cone-shaped crown and dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for over 100 years, making it a long-lived species. Its cones are typically reddish-brown and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The tree thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies lasiocarpa f. conica is primarily native to the mountainous regions of western North America, including parts of the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>This subspecies is commonly found in high-altitude forests, particularly in the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Northwest. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. The plant is adapted to harsh alpine conditions and often grows in association with other coniferous species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches that support its growth and survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies lasiocarpa f. conica was mainly introduced to specific regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, often in mountainous or high-altitude areas.</p>
<p>This introduction is typically associated with horticultural or ecological restoration efforts. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments. The plant's distribution has been limited to areas where its environmental requirements are met.</p>
<p>Its introduction has sometimes led to concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
