                <h1>Achyronia pinea</h1>
<p>Achyronia pinea, commonly known as the dwarf pine, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly twisted. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, cone-like structures containing its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the mild, humid climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>The dwarf pine is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia pinea has needle-like leaves that are slender, dark green on top, and whitish underneath, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a conic capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is shallow and fibrous, adapting to dry, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia pinea is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky, and coastal environments, often found in scrublands and maquis vegetation. This plant is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, such as high sunlight exposure and limited water availability. It is commonly found in countries like Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Turkey.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the Mediterranean climate, which provides the specific ecological conditions it requires.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia pinea was mainly introduced to control erosion on disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil. However, its introduction has led to unintended ecological impacts in some regions. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environments.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, it can become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
