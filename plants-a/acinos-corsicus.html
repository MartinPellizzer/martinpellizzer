                <h1>Acinos corsicus</h1>
<p>Acinos corsicus, commonly known as Corsican acicula, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it forms dense mats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Corsica.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos corsicus has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 1 and 3 centimeters in length, with a gray-green color and a hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a rough, grayish-brown bark, and grows in a shrub-like pattern. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, and arranged in dense clusters, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption in its rocky, arid habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos corsicus is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, specifically found in southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Italy, France, Spain, and the Canary Islands. It thrives in rocky, arid, or semi-arid environments, often growing on limestone or sandy soils. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acinos corsicus is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acinos corsicus is a hardy alpine plant native to Corsica, known for its resilience and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing mature clumps, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle of Acinos corsicus is slow, with flowering occurring in late summer, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and requires minimal watering, as overwatering can lead to root rot. Fertilization should be light, using a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is minimal, mainly to remove dead foliage. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by slugs and snails.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant perennials like sedums or lavender can enhance its growth in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acinos corsicus is a hardy plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, white flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species in alpine and rocky environments. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its deep root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acinos corsicus contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of its ecosystem.</p>
