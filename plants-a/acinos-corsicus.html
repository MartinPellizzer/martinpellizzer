                <h1>Acinos corsicus</h1>
<p>Acinos corsicus, commonly known as Corsican thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its spiny leaves and purple-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in mountainous areas. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a woolly texture, and the flowers are arranged in a dense, spherical head.</p>
<p>Acinos corsicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos corsicus has compound, alternate leaves that are pinnate or bipinnate, with small, linear to lanceolate leaflets, typically ranging from 1 to 3 cm in length, and a gray-green color due to a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, often branching, with a rough, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense cymes, with white to pale yellow petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are small, winged, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the rocky, arid environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos corsicus is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and mountainous areas, including Corsica, Sardinia, and the Balearic Islands. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments with well-drained soils. It is often seen in alpine and subalpine zones, where it forms part of the local flora.</p>
<p>Acinos corsicus is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos corsicus was mainly introduced to new habitats in North America, particularly in the western United States.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides, open woodlands, and rocky slopes. This plant is often associated with dry, sunny environments and has shown adaptability to different soil types. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently considered invasive in most areas where it has been established.</p>
