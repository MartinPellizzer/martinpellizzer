                    <h1>Allocasuarina simulans</h1>
<p>Allocasuarina simulans, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique cylindrical, scale-like leaves that are densely packed along the twigs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrublands.</p>
<p>Allocasuarina simulans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
