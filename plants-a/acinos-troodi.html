                <h1>Acinos troodi</h1>
<p>Acinos troodi, commonly known as the alpine aster, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are usually blue to purple in color, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>Acinos troodi is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos troodi has leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stems, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often branching, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense heads, with white petals and yellow centers, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos troodi is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes, ridges, and open woodlands. This plant thrives in regions with Mediterranean climates characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It is often associated with chaparral and coastal scrub ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acinos troodi is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos troodi was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. It has been reported in both natural and anthropogenic environments, often spreading through seeds dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in many regions where it has been introduced.</p>
