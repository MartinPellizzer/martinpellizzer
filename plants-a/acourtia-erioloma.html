                <h1>Acourtia erioloma</h1>
<p>Acourtia erioloma, commonly known as the sticky pad plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Acourtia erioloma is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia erioloma has small, ovate leaves that are typically green and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, with five petals, and bloom in late spring to early summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia erioloma is primarily native to Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. The plant thrives in rocky soils and open habitats. It is commonly observed in desert scrub and grassland environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions within Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia erioloma was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in forest understories. This plant has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species with limited ecological impact in its introduced range.</p>
