<p>Azorella ulicina, commonly known as the Chilean cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the high Andes of Chile and is adapted to the harsh, cold, and arid conditions of its environment. The plant forms dense, low-growing cushions composed of tightly packed stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss and protect against extreme weather. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or white, and it produces tiny, dry fruits that disperse seeds through the wind.</p>
<p>Azorella ulicina is an important component of the alpine ecosystem, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
