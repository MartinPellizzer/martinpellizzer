                <h1>Achras calcicola</h1>
<p>Achras calcicola, commonly known as the limestone achenes, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family, commonly known as the palm family, and is characterized by its unique morphological features. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, showcasing its adaptation to arid and nutrient-poor environments. Its structure includes a slender trunk and pinnate leaves, which contribute to its distinct appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Achras calcicola is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras calcicola has thick, fleshy leaves that are typically spoon-shaped (spatulate) with a waxy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, displaying a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a round, fleshy drupe that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are extensive and fibrous, anchoring the plant in rocky or calcareous soils and helping it absorb nutrients from the environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras calcicola is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Africa, particularly in countries such as Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and calcareous soils, often found in mountainous and coastal areas. This plant is commonly associated with Mediterranean climates, where it adapts to hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is often seen growing in open habitats such as scrublands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras calcicola was mainly introduced to areas with limestone soils and arid or semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as parts of Mexico, Central America, and the southwestern United States. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
