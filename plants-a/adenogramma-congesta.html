                <h1>Adenogramma congesta</h1>
<p>Adenogramma congesta, commonly known as the clustered adenogramma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are ovate and covered with fine hairs, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Adenogramma congesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenogramma congesta has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light brown color, growing in a shrub-like pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma congesta is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Myanmar.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within evergreen forests at moderate to high elevations. The plant is commonly found in areas with rich organic soil and consistent moisture levels. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches that support its growth requirements.</p>
<p>Adenogramma congesta is not widely distributed and is considered a rare species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma congesta was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant. The species has been distributed across various parts of the world, including parts of Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it adaptable to a range of garden environments.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native areas.</p>
