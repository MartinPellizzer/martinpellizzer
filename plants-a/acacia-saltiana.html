                        <h1>Acacia saltiana</h1>
<p>Acacia saltiana, commonly known as the saltbush acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, feathery leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to saline and drought conditions, making it a hardy species for challenging environments. Its root system helps stabilize soil, and it is often used in rehabilitation of degraded lands.</p>
<p>Acacia saltiana is also valued for its potential in traditional medicine and as a source of animal forage.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia saltiana is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Angola.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in dune environments and along the edges of coastal forests. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, with its deep root system allowing it to access groundwater. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Acacia saltiana is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers, which bloom during the warmer months.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia saltiana was mainly introduced to regions with semi-arid to arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it suitable for dryland environments. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of browse for livestock. Its introduction has been noted in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Australia.</p>
<p>However, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native habitats if not managed properly.</p>
