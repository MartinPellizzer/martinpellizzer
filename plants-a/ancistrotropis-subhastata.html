                    <h1>Ancistrotropis subhastata</h1>
<p>Ancistrotropis subhastata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandburs, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, spiny fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>The species is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its persistent seeds and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
