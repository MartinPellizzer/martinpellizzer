                <h1>Acourtia fragrans</h1>
<p>Acourtia fragrans, commonly known as the sweet violet, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, violet-colored flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Acourtia fragrans is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia fragrans has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, featuring white petals with a faint pinkish tinge, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia fragrans is primarily native to Mexico Central.</p>
<p>It is found in the central regions of Mexico, including states such as Hidalgo, Puebla, and Tlaxcala. This plant typically grows in dry to semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. It is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions within Mexico Central due to its ecological preferences.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia fragrans was mainly introduced to new habitats in the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It has been observed spreading in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry grasslands. The plant's ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils contributes to its successful establishment in these environments. It is often found in coastal and inland regions with Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
