                        <h1>Acacia mirbelii</h1>
<p>Acacia mirbelii, commonly known as the Mirbel's acacia, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 5 meters in height. The plant features bipinnate leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces yellow globular flower heads. Its flowers are followed by woody pods that contain flat, oblong seeds.</p>
<p>Acacia mirbelii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia mirbelii is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Angola, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Namib Desert and surrounding areas. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland dunes. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Acacia mirbelii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia mirbelii was mainly introduced to areas with a warm, dry climate and well-drained soils, often found in regions with Mediterranean or semi-arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly established in disturbed sites, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. This plant has been reported in several countries in the Mediterranean Basin, including Spain, Italy, and parts of North Africa. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and use in traditional medicine.</p>
