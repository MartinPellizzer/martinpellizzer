                    <h1>Acacia ferocior</h1>
<p>Acacia ferocior, commonly known as the fierce acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow to orange flower clusters, which are typically arranged in dense, globular inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Acacia ferocior is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
