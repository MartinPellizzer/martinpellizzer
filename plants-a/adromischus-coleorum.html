<p>Adromischus coleorum, commonly known as the "moonstone plant," is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in full sun. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adromischus coleorum has thick, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a bluish-green color and a waxy texture that helps it store water.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and it grows close to the ground, forming a compact plant. It produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy, well-draining soils it inhabits.</p>

<p>Adromischus coleorum is primarily native to Namibia.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country, particularly in the northern and central parts. This succulent plant thrives in rocky soils and is often seen growing on outcrops or in crevices. It is well adapted to the harsh, dry climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and collections.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adromischus coleorum was mainly introduced to regions with mild, arid climates where it can thrive in well-drained soil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with full sun exposure and low humidity. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive, fleshy leaves that resemble small, rounded stones. It requires minimal water and is relatively easy to care for, making it popular among succulent enthusiasts.</p>
