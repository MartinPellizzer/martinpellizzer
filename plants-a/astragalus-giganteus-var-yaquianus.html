                    <h1>Astragalus giganteus var. yaquianus</h1>
<p>Astragalus giganteus var. yaquianus, commonly known as the Yaquian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and pinnately compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
