                <h1>Adiantum whitei</h1>
<p>Adiantum whitei, commonly known as the White's maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum whitei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in controlled, humid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum whitei has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, pinnately arranged, and typically have a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually light green, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they can grow up to 30 cm in length. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively hidden beneath the foliage. Adiantum whitei produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The fruit is a spore-bearing capsule that disperses spores by wind, and the roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum whitei is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This fern thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often associated with limestone substrates and is frequently seen in wetlands and swamp forests.</p>
<p>Adiantum whitei is an important component of the understory vegetation in these habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum whitei was mainly introduced to regions with moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky stream banks.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it a common sight in temperate climates. This plant is often found in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial ferns in its native range. Its introduction has been noted in several regions outside its original habitat due to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements.</p>
