                <h1>Aegiphila umbraculiformis</h1>
<p>Aegiphila umbraculiformis, commonly known as the Umbrella Plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaves that provide shade, giving it its common name. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Aegiphila umbraculiformis is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila umbraculiformis has compound, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically arranged in a dense, bushy pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, bark-like texture that is usually grayish-brown in color, and it grows in a sprawling or shrub-like manner. Its small, clustered flowers are pink to purple in color, with five petals and a tubular structure, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
