                        <h1>Acaena agnipila var. aequispina</h1>
<p>Acaena agnipila var. aequispina, commonly known as the New Zealand bristled burr, is a shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous, woody husk. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish flowers. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>The species is known for its ability to form dense stands, contributing to the ecological structure of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena agnipila var. aequispina is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions of the Southern Alps. This variety grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. It is commonly associated with temperate rainforests and is often found in areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the cool, wet climate of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena agnipila var. aequispina was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a horticultural ornamental due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its prolific seed production contribute to its invasive nature.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and protect native plant communities.</p>
