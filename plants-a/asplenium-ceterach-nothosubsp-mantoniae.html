<p>Asplenium ceterach nothosubsp.</p>
<p>mantoniae, commonly known as the Mantoniae spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to the southern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, dark green, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as along streams or in rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually short and compact, with a distinctive, serrated edge.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is considered a hybrid form, likely resulting from natural crosses between A. ceterach and other related species.</p>
