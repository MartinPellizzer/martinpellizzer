                        <h1>Acacia turbata</h1>
<p>Acacia turbata, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia turbata is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia turbata is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and rocky outcrops where it thrives in dry, well-drained soils. This species is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient component of the local ecosystem. It often grows along riverbanks and in areas with seasonal water availability.</p>
<p>Acacia turbata plays an important role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia turbata was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its drought tolerance and rapid growth rate. It has been introduced to several countries in Africa and Asia for its ecological and economic benefits.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential in some areas requires careful management.</p>
