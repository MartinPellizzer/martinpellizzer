                    <h1>Astrophytum pygmaeum</h1>
<p>Astrophytum pygmaeum, commonly known as the pygmy cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to the desert regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its stem is ribbed and can store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
