<p>Aechmanthera gossypina, commonly known as the cottonleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, hairy textures.</p>
<p>Aechmanthera gossypina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmanthera gossypina has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dull green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat hairy, with a pale green to brownish color, and grows upright with a trailing habit. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, with five petals, and bloom in late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>
