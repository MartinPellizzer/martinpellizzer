<p>Astragalus uncatus, commonly known as the hooked milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its seed pods are distinctive, being curved and hooked at the tip, which aids in seed dispersal.</p>
