<p>Adiantum charlottae, commonly known as Charlotte's maidenhair, is a rare fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, organic soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native region.</p>
