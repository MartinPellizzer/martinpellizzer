                <h1>Adiantum charlottae</h1>
<p>Adiantum charlottae, commonly known as Charlotte's maidenhair, is a rare fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, organic soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native region.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum charlottae has fern-like leaves that are bi-lobed, with a delicate, lace-like appearance and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with each leaflet being small and narrow, typically measuring up to 2 inches in length. The plant has a short, slender stem that is usually covered in a smooth, pale green bark. It does not produce flowers, as it is a non-flowering plant, and its reproductive structures consist of spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum charlottae is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically found in parts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. This fern is commonly associated with limestone-rich soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats, making it a rare and localized species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum charlottae was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in woodland habitats, where it thrives in the cool, humid conditions. This fern is often seen growing on rocky outcrops or along stream banks. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
