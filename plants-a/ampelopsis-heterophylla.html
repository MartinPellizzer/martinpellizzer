                    <h1>Ampelopsis heterophylla</h1>
<p>Ampelopsis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves that vary in shape and size along the stem, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
