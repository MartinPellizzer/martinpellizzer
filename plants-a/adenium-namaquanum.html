                    <h1>Adenium namaquanum</h1>
<p>Adenium namaquanum, commonly known as the desert candle, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers during the rainy season, followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. Its unique morphology makes it well-adapted to extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>It is also known for its toxic sap, which contains cardioactive compounds.</p>
