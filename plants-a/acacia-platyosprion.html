                    <h1>Acacia platyosprion</h1>
<p>Acacia platyosprion, commonly known as the flat-branched acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Acacia platyosprion is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness.</p>
