<p>Athyrium skinneri, commonly known as the Skinner's lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slight silvery sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new growth from the base, allowing it to spread gradually.</p>
<p>Athyrium skinneri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden beds.</p>
