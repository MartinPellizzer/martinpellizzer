                <h1>Adelia oaxacana</h1>
<p>Adelia oaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxaca adelia, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk.</p>
<p>Adelia oaxacana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia oaxacana has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in dry, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia oaxacana is a rare plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico, specifically the state of Oaxaca.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within its native range, primarily in cloud forests. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high moisture levels and well-drained soils. Adelia oaxacana is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adelia oaxacana is a resilient plant native to Mexico, known for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle of Adelia oaxacana is relatively rapid, with flowering occurring within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage blooming. Common pests include aphids and mealybugs, which can be managed with insecticidal soap or neem oil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the plant's overall health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
