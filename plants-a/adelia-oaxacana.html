                <h1>Adelia oaxacana</h1>
<p>Adelia oaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxacan adelia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Oaxaca, Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and somewhat woody.</p>
<p>Adelia oaxacana is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climate of its native habitat, with a dormant period during the dry season.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia oaxacana has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 3 to 6 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, featuring white petals with a yellow center, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia oaxacana is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southeast, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the diverse ecosystems of these regions. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including dry forests and shrublands. Its distribution spans across different climatic zones within Mexico.</p>
<p>Adelia oaxacana plays an important ecological role in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia oaxacana was mainly introduced to areas with similar climatic conditions to its native habitat, including regions with warm temperatures and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It has been observed in parts of the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Texas, where it thrives in sunny, open environments. This distribution suggests that it has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced by humans, possibly through horticultural practices or seed dispersal. The plant's ability to adapt to new environments has contributed to its spread beyond its original range.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems remains a topic of ongoing study.</p>
