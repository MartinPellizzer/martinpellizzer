                        <h1>Abies cephalonica var. apollinis</h1>
<p>Abies cephalonica var. apollinis, commonly known as the Apollo fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of Greece.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely packed than those of its parent species. The cones are typically small and upright, with a distinctive reddish-brown coloration. This variety thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
