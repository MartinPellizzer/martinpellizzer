                <h1>Achillea paucidentata</h1>
<p>Achillea paucidentata, commonly known as the slender yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a silvery underside, and it produces small white or pale yellow flowers in flat-topped clusters.</p>
<p>Achillea paucidentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea paucidentata has leaves that are basal, spoon-shaped, and slightly hairy, with a grayish-green color and a narrow, upright arrangement.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and grows upright, with a light green color and a rough texture. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and survive in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea paucidentata is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly the Pyrenees and the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and limestone soils at high elevations, often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is commonly seen in areas with harsh, sunny conditions. It is also present in parts of northern Africa, including Morocco and Algeria, where it grows in similar environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea paucidentata was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since spread to other parts of Europe and has been reported in several countries including Spain, Italy, and France. Although it is not considered invasive in its native range, it has shown some potential to spread in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant's distribution is primarily influenced by human activity and climate conditions.</p>
<p>It is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas where it thrives in full sun.</p>
