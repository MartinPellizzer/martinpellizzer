The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring palmate leaves with a distinctive five-lobed structure. Its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a plant of both botanical interest and caution.</p>
<p>Aconitum miyabei thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum miyabei has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are typically large, with deeply lobed or dissected blades, often green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, usually smooth and slightly hairy, with a dark green to brown bark that becomes rough with age.

The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
