                <h1>Aeginetia capitata</h1>
<p>Aeginetia capitata, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds with silky, wind-dispersed hairs. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in shrublands and grasslands.</p>
<p>Aeginetia capitata is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local insect populations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeginetia capitata has leaves that are alternate, lanceolate in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is herbaceous, slightly hairy, and grows upright with a branching pattern, while the bark is thin and pale green. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in a dense, umbellate inflorescence at the top of the plant, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>
