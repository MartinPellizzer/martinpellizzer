                    <h1>Alsophila lepifera</h1>
<p>Alsophila lepifera, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue light at night, which is a unique feature among ferns. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various invertebrates and contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems.</p>
