                    <h1>Armeria campestris var. linkii</h1>
<p>Armeria campestris var. linkii, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of western Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions.</p>
