                    <h1>Andriapetalum cayennense</h1>
<p>Andriapetalum cayennense, commonly known as the Cayenne sand mat, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations.</p>
