                <h1>Adenophyllum cavanillesii</h1>
<p>Adenophyllum cavanillesii, commonly known as the Cavanilles' adenophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in coastal areas. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum cavanillesii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth green upper surface and a slightly hairy underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, grayish bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring months and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid environments by anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum cavanillesii is primarily native to the Canary Islands, specifically Tenerife and La Gomera.</p>
<p>It is found in rocky coastal areas and cliffs, where it thrives in the unique microclimates of these volcanic islands. This plant is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions typical of the Canary's coastal zones. It is an endemic species, meaning it is found nowhere else in the world.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific islands, reflecting its specialized ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum cavanillesii was mainly introduced to disturbed habitats such as roadsides, quarries, and urban areas due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with Mediterranean climates, where it adapts well to dry summers and mild, wet winters. This plant is often spread through human activity, including landscaping and accidental seed dispersal. It has become a common weed in agricultural and natural areas, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is also valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits in certain environments.</p>
