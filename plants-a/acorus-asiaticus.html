                <h1>Acorus asiaticus</h1>
<p>Acorus asiaticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are typically green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Acorus asiaticus thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus asiaticus has sword-shaped leaves that are broad at the base and taper to a point, arranged in a rosette formation, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length with a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright from the base. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a spadix surrounded by a pale green spathe, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed berry that disperses its seeds by water and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus asiaticus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments and is often associated with freshwater habitats. It is also present in parts of India and Nepal.</p>
<p>Acorus asiaticus is an important species in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental and ecological roles.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus asiaticus was mainly introduced to wetlands, marshes, and slow-moving freshwater areas where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with abundant water, such as ponds, ditches, and the edges of lakes. This plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its presence can indicate good water quality and ecological balance in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>However, in some areas, it may become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
