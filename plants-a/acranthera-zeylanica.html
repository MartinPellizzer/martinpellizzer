                <h1>Acranthera zeylanica</h1>
<p>Acranthera zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon lily, is a flowering plant native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes orchids, and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Acranthera zeylanica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera zeylanica has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera zeylanica is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in forested areas and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with wetlands and swampy habitats. It is also present in some parts of Africa, particularly in Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera zeylanica was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become established in various regions across the country. The plant is typically found in coastal and urban environments, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to spread and compete with native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, management efforts are ongoing to prevent its spread into natural ecosystems.</p>
