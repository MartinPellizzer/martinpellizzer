                    <h1>Anisophyllum chamaesyce</h1>
<p>Anisophyllum chamaesyce, commonly known as the common stellaria, is a low-growing annual herb belonging to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Anisophyllum chamaesyce is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and gardens, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
