<p>Angraecum, commonly known as the star orchid, is a genus of about 200 species of epiphytic and lithophytic orchids native to Madagascar and tropical Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their long, slender stems and showy, star-shaped flowers that often open at night. Angraecum species typically have thick, fleshy roots adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. They thrive in humid, shaded environments and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
