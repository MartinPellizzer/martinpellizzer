                    <h1>Ampelopsis heterophylla var. citrulloides</h1>
<p>Ampelopsis heterophylla var. citrulloides, commonly known as the citron vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to China.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape depending on light exposure, a characteristic known as heterophylly. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that give way to orange to red berries in the fall. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>The berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their mild toxicity.</p>
