                    <h1>Astragalus siccaneus</h1>
<p>Astragalus siccaneus, commonly known as the dry milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in dryland restoration projects.</p>
