<p>Acacia cordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, leathery, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense spikes. Acacia cordata is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought tolerant.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia cordata is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and savanna regions, often growing along riverbanks and in rocky soils. This species thrives in areas with a temperate to subtropical climate and is well adapted to dry conditions. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various animals.</p>
<p>Acacia cordata is also known for its distinctive cordate (heart-shaped) leaves and yellow flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia cordata was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
