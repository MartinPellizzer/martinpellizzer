<p>Anatherum squarrosum is a hardy grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its wiry stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that help it conserve water. This plant thrives in poor soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its resilience makes it an important component of dryland ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant.</p>
