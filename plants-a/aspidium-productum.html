<p>Aspidium productum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It has long, slender fronds that are typically submerged or floating, with a distinctive, delicate appearance. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to the substrate and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Its leaves are usually divided into small, lance-shaped segments, and it thrives in still or slow-moving water.</p>
<p>Aspidium productum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen.</p>
