                <h1>Adesmia capitellata</h1>
<p>Adesmia capitellata, commonly known as the yellow bursaria, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant is a shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought conditions. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in heads, and the leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets.</p>
<p>Adesmia capitellata is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia capitellata has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, clustered in dense heads, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia capitellata is primarily native to Argentina Northwest, Argentina South, Chile Central, and Chile North.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky soils and open habitats, often growing along riverbanks and in scrublands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its ecological preference for dry, sunny environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia capitellata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in the North Island, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to its establishment in native ecosystems. Although it is not considered a major invasive species, it can compete with native flora in certain areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is currently limited to specific regions but shows potential for further spread if environmental conditions remain favorable.</p>
