                    <h1>Agrostis dispar</h1>
<p>Agrostis dispar, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet. It produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind or water.</p>
<p>Agrostis dispar is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
