                    <h1>Atriplex leucoclada var. mandavillea</h1>
<p>Atriplex leucoclada var. mandavillea, commonly known as the Mandaville saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used in rehabilitation of degraded lands due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
