                <h1>Adiantum andicola</h1>
<p>Adiantum andicola, commonly known as the Andean maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in rocky or shaded areas. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive rachis that is often grooved.</p>
<p>Adiantum andicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum andicola has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, lacey appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green and have a smooth texture, though they may turn bronze or brown at the edges when dry. The stem is slender, upright, and often covered in a thin, smooth bark that is light green to reddish in color. This species does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-producing plant, and its reproductive structures are microscopic spore cases rather than flowers.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils, aiding in its survival in nutrient-poor environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum andicola is primarily native to Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, Nicaragua, and Panam√°.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in the humid tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant is well-adapted to the diverse ecosystems across its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for high humidity and well-drained soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum andicola was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This plant is commonly found in regions of South America, including parts of Ecuador and Colombia. Its introduction to new habitats has sometimes led to its naturalization in areas with similar climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens and greenhouses in various parts of the world.</p>
