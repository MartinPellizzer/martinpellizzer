<p>Airosperma vanuense, commonly known as the Vanuatu star grass, is a flowering plant native to the island of Vanuatu in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Airosperma vanuense is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native ecosystem.</p>
