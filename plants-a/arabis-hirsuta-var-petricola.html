<p>It features basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and delicate floral display.</p>
