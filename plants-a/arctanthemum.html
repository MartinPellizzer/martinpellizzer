                    <h1>Arctanthemum</h1>
<p>Arctanthemum, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Arctanthemum species are characterized by their small, often white or yellow flowers and their succulent leaves, which help them conserve water. They are generally low-growing plants with a mat-forming habit, which allows them to thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, many of which are used in horticulture for their ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
