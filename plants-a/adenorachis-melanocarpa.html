                <h1>Adenorachis melanocarpa</h1>
<p>Adenorachis melanocarpa, commonly known as the black-fruited bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment.</p>
<p>Adenorachis melanocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenorachis melanocarpa has leaves that are simple, alternate, and ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenorachis melanocarpa is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as chaparral and coastal sage scrub. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often associated with coastal and mountainous regions where the climate is Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and has a limited geographic range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenorachis melanocarpa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soil. The plant is particularly common in the western United States, including parts of California, Nevada, and Oregon. Its introduction has been associated with human activities like land development and transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in disturbed ecosystems.</p>
