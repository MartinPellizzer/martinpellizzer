                        <h1>Abutilon umbelliferum</h1>
<p>Abutilon umbelliferum, commonly known as the common velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton.</p>
<p>Abutilon umbelliferum is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in some regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon umbelliferum is primarily native to the southern United States, including Texas, New Mexico, and parts of Arizona.</p>
<p>It is also found in northern Mexico, particularly in the states of Chihuahua and Sonora. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is commonly associated with disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dry fields.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the southwestern regions of North America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon umbelliferum was mainly introduced to control erosion and for ornamental purposes in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with disturbed ground such as roadsides, railways, and construction sites. The plant has a rapid growth rate and can form dense stands, which can lead to the displacement of native vegetation. Its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions makes it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its competitive nature and potential to alter local ecosystems.</p>
