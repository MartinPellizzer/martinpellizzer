                <h1>Adinandra lenticellata</h1>
<p>Adinandra lenticellata, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed adinandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous stems and small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy berries as fruit.</p>
<p>Adinandra lenticellata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra lenticellata has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that develops shallow lenticels, and it grows in a shrub-like form. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, with four petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra lenticellata is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. The plant thrives in humid and warm climates, commonly growing in shaded undergrowth. It is an important component of the local flora and is often found in primary and secondary forest habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the island of Borneo, with limited occurrences in adjacent areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra lenticellata was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it suitable for regions with warm temperatures year-round. This plant is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and small flowers. It has been reported to spread naturally in some regions, potentially becoming invasive if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited by climate conditions and human activity.</p>
