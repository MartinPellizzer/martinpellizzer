                    <h1>Armeriastrum huetii</h1>
<p>Armeriastrum huetii, commonly known as the Huet's silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes.</p>
