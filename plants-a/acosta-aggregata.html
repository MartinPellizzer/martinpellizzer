                <h1>Acosta aggregata</h1>
<p>Acosta aggregata, commonly known as the clustered acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta aggregata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 3 to 8 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and has a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta aggregata is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found in cloud forests and mountainous areas. This plant is commonly associated with rocky soils and slopes, where it adapts to the cooler and more humid conditions. Its distribution is limited to these specific ecological zones, making it a characteristic species of the Andes.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is not widely found outside of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta aggregata was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was distributed primarily in coastal and lowland areas where it can thrive in sunny, well-drained soils. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in several regions, though it is not considered invasive in the local ecosystem. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides throughout the islands.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it has become a familiar sight in many parts of Hawaii.</p>
