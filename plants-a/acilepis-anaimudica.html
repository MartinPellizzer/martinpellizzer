                <h1>Acilepis anaimudica</h1>
<p>Acilepis anaimudica, commonly known as the Anaimudi acilepis, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forests. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a glossy surface and serrated edges.</p>
<p>Acilepis anaimudica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis anaimudica has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and a tubular structure, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, while the roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis anaimudica is primarily native to India.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of the country, particularly in the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly associated with forests and is sometimes found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific areas within India, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis anaimudica was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in humid climates. This plant is often found in shaded undergrowth, where it competes with other understory species for light and nutrients. Its introduction has been noted in several regions where it has established itself as an invasive species.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to other more aggressive introduced plants.</p>
