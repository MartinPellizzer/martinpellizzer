                    <h1>Athyrocarpus persicariifolius f. tetraspermus</h1>
<p>Athyrocarpus persicariifolius f. tetraspermus, commonly known as the four-seeded persicariifolius, is a rare botanical variant of the genus Athyrocarpus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which resembles the leaves of Persicaria species, hence its common name. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with small, ovate leaves arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences, producing small, yellowish-green blooms.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique genetic traits and limited distribution in specific tropical regions.</p>
