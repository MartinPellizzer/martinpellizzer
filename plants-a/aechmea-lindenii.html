<p>Aechmea lindenii, commonly known as the pink pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that range in color from pink to red, often resembling a pineapple. Its foliage is typically broad and sword-shaped, with a waxy texture and a bluish-green hue.</p>
<p>Aechmea lindenii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea lindenii has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, fleshy, and leathery, arranged in a tight spiral around the central stem, with a waxy, bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and often hidden beneath the leaves, with a smooth, pale greenish-gray bark. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, producing small white to pink flowers that bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>
