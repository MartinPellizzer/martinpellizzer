                <h1>Adenocalymma sepiarium</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma sepiarium, commonly known as the sea bean, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. The plant typically grows in sandy or saline soils, adapting well to coastal environments. Its leaves are usually alternate and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma sepiarium is often found in dune habitats, playing a role in stabilizing sand dunes through its extensive root system.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma sepiarium has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma sepiarium is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of South America, including Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest understories, particularly in the Atlantic Forest biome. This plant thrives in humid tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. It is often associated with riparian zones and lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Adenocalymma sepiarium is considered a threatened species in many parts of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma sepiarium was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1980s and has since become established in several regions. The plant thrives in coastal and saline environments, often found along estuaries and tidal flats. Its introduction is believed to be accidental, likely through contaminated soil or plant material.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is now monitored as a potential threat to native ecosystems.</p>
