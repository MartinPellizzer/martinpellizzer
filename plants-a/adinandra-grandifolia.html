                <h1>Adinandra grandifolia</h1>
<p>Adinandra grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered adinandra, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn red when mature.</p>
<p>Adinandra grandifolia is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra grandifolia has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale gray bark that exhibits a climbing growth pattern, often twining around other vegetation. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white or pale yellow petals, and they bloom during the dry season, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra grandifolia is primarily native to Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This plant typically grows in lowland forests and along riverbanks. It is commonly observed in the southern and central provinces of Vietnam.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes moist and shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra grandifolia was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid and warm environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands, for ornamental and ecological purposes. Due to its adaptability, it has become naturalized in some locations, sometimes competing with native species.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
