                <h1>Acer opulifolium</h1>
<p>Acer opulifolium, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically bright green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks.</p>
<p>The mountain maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer opulifolium has leaves that are ovate to broadly ovate, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and can reach up to 10 cm in length; they are bright green in summer and turn red or yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and reddish-brown, with a straight growth pattern, and the bark becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during late spring to early summer, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer opulifolium is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States, particularly found in Washington, Oregon, and California.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of western Canada and the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands, meadows, and along streambanks. This species typically grows at elevations between 600 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, habitat loss and climate change pose potential threats to its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer opulifolium is a deciduous shrub known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or layering, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves rapid spring growth, flowering in late spring, and a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs like hydrangeas or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer opulifolium is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a wide range of ecological interactions. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer opulifolium is a species of maple known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its sap can be processed similarly to other maple syrups, though it is less sweet. In traditional medicine, it has been used for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. The tree plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is valued for its vibrant autumn foliage, making it a popular choice for landscaping and horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer opulifolium has a variety of cultivars that showcase its ornamental value, including 'Coral Beauty' and 'Autumn Flame', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It also has several hybrids with other maple species, such as Acer x carpinifolium, which combine the hardiness of opulifolium with the ornamental traits of other maples. These hybrids are often used in landscape design due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a range of conditions, making it a popular choice for gardens and parks.</p>
<p>Its diverse cultivars and hybrids contribute significantly to the diversity of maple trees in horticulture.</p>
