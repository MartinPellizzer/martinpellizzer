                <h1>Aconitum leiostachyum</h1>
<p>Aconitum leiostachyum, commonly known as the smooth-stalked aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a spire-like cluster at the top of the stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum leiostachyum contains potent toxins and is considered highly poisonous to both humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum leiostachyum has leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a rough texture, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spikes, and have a spurred structure typical of the Ranunculaceae family, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum leiostachyum is primarily native to the eastern Himalayas, including regions in India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude areas, typically found in moist, shaded forest environments. This species is commonly associated with alpine and subalpine vegetation. It is often found growing in rocky soils and mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of southern China as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum leiostachyum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in during the late 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue and purple flowers. This species has since become naturalized in moist woodland areas and streamside habitats. However, it is considered invasive in some regions because of its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
