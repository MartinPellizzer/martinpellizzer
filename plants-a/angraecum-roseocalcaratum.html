                    <h1>Angraecum roseocalcaratum</h1>
<p>Angraecum roseocalcaratum, commonly known as the rose-flowered spider orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of pale pink to white flowers with intricate, spidery petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific nocturnal moths.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings.</p>
