                <h1>Adicea pulegifolia</h1>
<p>Adicea pulegifolia, commonly known as the stinkwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, alternate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its hard, durable wood.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released when the leaves are crushed.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea pulegifolia has leaves that are alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 3–6 cm long and 1.5–3 cm wide, arranged spirally along the stem. The stem is slender, semi-woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, with a structure featuring four petals and five stamens; it is pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea pulegifolia is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly Texas, New Mexico, and parts of Arizona.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. This plant is commonly associated with desert ecosystems and is well adapted to withstand drought conditions. It is also found in some regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea pulegifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shady conditions and spreads rapidly through its rhizomes.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local biodiversity.</p>
