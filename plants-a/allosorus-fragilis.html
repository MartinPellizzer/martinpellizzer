                    <h1>Allosorus fragilis</h1>
<p>Allosorus fragilis, commonly known as the brittle bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often inflated and resemble bladders, which help it remain buoyant in water. The plant is a carnivorous species, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic insects. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its fragility and unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
