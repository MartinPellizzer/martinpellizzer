                    <h1>Anisophyllum senile</h1>
<p>Anisophyllum senile, commonly known as the old man's beard, is a rare and unique fern-like plant characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant's distinctive appearance comes from its long, dangling stipes that bear clusters of small, scale-like leaves. Anisophyllum senile is known for its slow growth and is often found in crevices or on rock faces.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
