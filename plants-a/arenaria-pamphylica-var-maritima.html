                    <h1>Arenaria pamphylica var. maritima</h1>
<p>Arenaria pamphylica var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of Turkey.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt-laden environments, making it a typical component of maritime dunes. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract various pollinators. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for coastal restoration projects.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
