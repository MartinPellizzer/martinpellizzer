                    <h1>Agave amoena</h1>
<p>Agave amoena, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence bearing white to yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves.</p>
<p>Agave amoena is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping in desert gardens.</p>
