                    <h1>Actinocephalus stereophyllus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus stereophyllus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, waxy, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, which bloom during the night. The plant has a short, upright stem with clustered, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers emit a faint fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Actinocephalus stereophyllus is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
