                <h1>Actinocephalus stereophyllus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus stereophyllus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, waxy, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, which bloom during the night. The plant has a short, upright stem with clustered, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers emit a faint fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Actinocephalus stereophyllus is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus stereophyllus has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, greyish-brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensively branched, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus stereophyllus is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and parts of KwaZulu-Natal. This plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and fynbos vegetation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus stereophyllus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in urban and suburban areas where it thrives in disturbed soils and sunny environments. This plant has shown rapid growth and adaptability, allowing it to spread beyond its original introduction sites. Its presence has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
