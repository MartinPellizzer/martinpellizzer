<p>Avena sterilis subsp.</p>
<p>pseudosativa, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild annual grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, awned spikelets that typically bear sterile florets.</p>
<p>The plant produces a fibrous, inedible seed head, which is often used as a forage crop for livestock. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides and in cultivated fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings but also has historical significance in traditional farming practices.</p>
