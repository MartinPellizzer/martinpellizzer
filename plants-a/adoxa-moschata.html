<p>Adoxa moschata, commonly known as sweet pepper or musk root, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adoxaceae and is characterized by its fragrant, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that resemble tiny peppers, which are edible and have a mild, sweet flavor. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are slender and often reddish in color.</p>
<p>Adoxa moschata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and pleasant aroma.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adoxa moschata has heart-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they are generally small, measuring up to 3 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, white or pale green, clustered in umbels, and bloom in late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adoxa moschata is primarily native to Eastern Europe and parts of Western Siberia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its range extends into northern regions of Russia and some areas of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally reported in southern parts of Western Europe.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adoxa moschata was mainly introduced to North America through human activities, including horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has spread across several states in the eastern United States, often outcompeting native species in invaded areas. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it a significant invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive nature, it is sometimes cultivated for its fragrant flowers and ornamental value.</p>
