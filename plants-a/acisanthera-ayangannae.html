                <h1>Acisanthera ayangannae</h1>
<p>Acisanthera ayangannae, commonly known as the Ayangannae sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring robust, hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to thrive in poor soils and high sunlight conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acisanthera ayangannae has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring yellow petals and stamens, and bloom from late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to absorb moisture from the surface layer of the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera ayangannae is primarily native to Guyana.</p>
<p>This species is found in the dense tropical rainforests of the country. It thrives in the humid and warm climate typical of the region. The plant is often seen growing in the undergrowth of primary forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Guyana's biodiversity-rich ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera ayangannae was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with ample sunlight and moderate rainfall, making it suitable for cultivation in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant is often used for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowering characteristics. Its introduction has been primarily driven by horticultural interests and the demand for exotic plants in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native regions.</p>
