                    <h1>Anathallis heloisae f. camboriensis</h1>
<p>Anathallis heloisae f. camboriensis, commonly known as the Cambori√≥ spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and its unique inflorescence, which bears a single, showy flower with a distinctive spider-like appearance. The plant produces a single, greenish-white flower with a prominent, hairy lip that mimics the appearance of a spider, aiding in pollination by specific fly species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
