<p>Abutilon cuspidatum, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Asia and is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have serrated edges.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the showy bracts attract pollinators and add ornamental value to gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon cuspidatum has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a greenish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are pendulous, with five petals and a prominent yellow stamen, blooming in late summer to early fall, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its native habitat in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon cuspidatum is a shrub native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to scattered locations in Florida, primarily in the wetlands and hammocks. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is commonly found in swampy areas, along rivers, and in coastal regions. This species grows at low altitudes, typically below 30 meters, and is often associated with wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Abutilon cuspidatum is listed as a species of concern in Florida, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon cuspidatum is a deciduous shrub known for its vibrant yellow-orange flowers and fuzzy leaves, often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. The plant has a growing season in spring and summer, during which it produces foliage and blooms, and it goes dormant in fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, and pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
