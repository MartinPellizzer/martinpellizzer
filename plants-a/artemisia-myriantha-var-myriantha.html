                    <h1>Artemisia myriantha var. myriantha</h1>
<p>Artemisia myriantha var. myriantha, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in rocky soils and dry slopes, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Its aromatic leaves and adaptability make it a notable species in xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
