                <h1>Adicea sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Adicea sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf adicea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late summer. It is native to parts of Africa and thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adicea sessilifolia is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea sessilifolia has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length and 1 to 2 cm in width.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern and are usually a deep green color. The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea sessilifolia is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist forest understories and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained, fertile soils. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also reported in parts of Southeast Asia, though its presence there is less documented.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea sessilifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the late 19th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. The plant thrives in a wide range of soil types and is particularly common in coastal and subalpine areas. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is now considered a potential invasive species in some parts of New Zealand.</p>
