                    <h1>Aloe × corderoyi</h1>
<p>Aloe × corderoyi, commonly known as the hybrid aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aloe genus and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are fleshy and covered in a white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers, typically blooming in spring. It is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it is less hardy than other aloe species and may require protection in colder climates.</p>
