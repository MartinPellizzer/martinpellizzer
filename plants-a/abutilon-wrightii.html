<p>Abutilon wrightii, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering plant native to China and Korea.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring smooth, grayish bark and alternate, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright orange or red bracts that resemble lanterns, which are not flowers but modified leaves. These bracts are often mistaken for flowers and are the primary ornamental feature of the plant.</p>
<p>Abutilon wrightii thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
