<p>Actinidia rufa var. typica is a lesser-known member of the Actinidiaceae family native to eastern asia. it is characterized by its vibrant red berries and heart-shaped leaves that change color with the seasons. this plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. while not as widely cultivated as its cousin actinidia deliciosa, it holds significant ecological value. its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a fascinating subject for botanists and gardeners alike.</p>
