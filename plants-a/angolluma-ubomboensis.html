                    <h1>Angolluma ubomboensis</h1>
<p>Angolluma ubomboensis, commonly known as the Ubombo ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and delicate, bioluminescent flowers that glow faintly in the dark. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high salinity and strong coastal winds. Its unique biological features make it a subject of interest for botanists studying adaptation to extreme environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
