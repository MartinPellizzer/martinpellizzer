                <h1>Achillea alpicola</h1>
<p>Achillea alpicola, commonly known as alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its slender stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Achillea alpicola is known for its hardiness and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea alpicola has basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear, with a silver-white underside, arranged in a rosette formation, and typically measuring 2–5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, with a slightly rough texture, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are composite, consisting of white ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cypsela, with pappus hairs that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in rocky or alpine soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea alpicola is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other alpine areas in Europe and North America as a horticultural plant. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is commonly found in alpine meadows and grasslands. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from climate change and habitat loss, Achillea alpicola is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea alpicola is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions, known for its compact, fern-like foliage and delicate, flat-topped flower clusters.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer, ensuring good drainage and light conditions for successful germination. This plant thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure, requiring moderate watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization should be minimal, with a balanced slow-release fertilizer applied in early spring, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions, and it pairs well with other alpine plants like矾根 and sedum for a cohesive garden design.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea alpicola is a hardy alpine plant that provides food and shelter for various small insects and mammals in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its bright yellow flowers, contributing to the local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other alpine species in rocky soils. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence enhances the ecological balance of alpine ecosystems by offering habitat and resources to a range of wildlife.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea alpicola is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe, known for its medicinal properties and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>It has been used to treat digestive issues and as a mild sedative due to its compounds with anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects. While not widely cultivated for culinary purposes, it is sometimes used in herbal teas and infusions. Its presence in alpine ecosystems contributes to biodiversity and supports local wildlife, making it important for ecological balance.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is often associated with resilience and the beauty of mountainous landscapes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea alpicola has several varieties and cultivars that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' and 'Purpurea', which are known for their striking yellow and purple foliage, respectively. While natural hybrids of Achillea alpicola are less common, crossbreeding with other yarrow species has led to the development of new cultivars with enhanced traits. These plants hold horticultural importance as they are used in rock gardens, borders, and as ground covers due to their hardiness and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Their ability to thrive in various soil types makes them a popular choice among gardeners.</p>
