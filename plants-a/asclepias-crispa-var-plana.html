                    <h1>Asclepias crispa var. plana</h1>
<p>Asclepias crispa var. plana, commonly known as the flat-leaf milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers with distinctive, folded petals and a central cluster of small, round structures. Its milky sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but beneficial for monarch butterflies as a food source for their larvae.</p>
<p>This variant is less common than other milkweed species but plays an important role in local ecosystems.</p>
