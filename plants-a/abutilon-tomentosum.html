                        <h1>Abutilon tomentosum</h1>
<p>Abutilon tomentosum, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fuzzy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its fibrous stems and hairy foliage make it a distinctive and sometimes invasive species in certain environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon tomentosum is primarily native to Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and parts of Colombia. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded areas near rivers or in dense forests. It is also known to occur in the West Indies, including islands like Cuba and Hispaniola.</p>
<p>Its native range includes areas with warm climates and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon tomentosum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive fuzzy leaves and showy flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in moist, disturbed areas such as streambanks and forest edges. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to outcompete native vegetation in certain habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered a non-native invasive species in some areas.</p>
