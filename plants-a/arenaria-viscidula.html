<p>Arenaria viscidula, commonly known as sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Arenaria viscidula plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
