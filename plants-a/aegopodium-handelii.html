                <h1>Aegopodium handelii</h1>
<p>Aegopodium handelii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ground ivy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegopodium handelii has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and often hairy, with a light green color and a creeping or upright growth pattern depending on environmental conditions. Its small white or greenish flowers are clustered in umbels, bloom in early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene that is dispersed by wind due to its feathery appendage.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in moist, shaded habitats.</p>
