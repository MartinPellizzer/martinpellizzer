                    <h1>Aeonium proliferum</h1>
<p>Aeonium proliferum, commonly known as the Tree Aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a thick, tree-like stem with rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a powdery white coating. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which bloom in clusters at the top of the stem. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Aeonium proliferum is also known for its ability to propagate easily through offsets, which can be removed and planted to create new plants.</p>
