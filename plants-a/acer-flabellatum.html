                <h1>Acer flabellatum</h1>
<p>Acer flabellatum, commonly known as the fan-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble a fan, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. Its flowers are small and yellow-green, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The tree produces samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds, contributing to its natural range and ecological role.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer flabellatum has palmate leaves that are finely divided, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its native habitat in moist, temperate environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer flabellatum is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to these areas, where it grows in high-altitude forests and mixed deciduous-coniferous woodlands. It typically thrives in cool, moist climates at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Acer flabellatum is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer flabellatum is a striking deciduous tree known for its distinctive, fan-shaped leaves and vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter, making it suitable for temperate climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its ornamental value in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer flabellatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of the local ecosystem. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of plant and animal life. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding land.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for insects and other organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer flabellatum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value, often planted in gardens and parks for its vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been traditionally used in some indigenous medicinal practices for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. The tree's wood, though not widely used industrially, contributes to local economies in regions where it is native. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain communities, representing resilience and seasonal change.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems also supports biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer flabellatum has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Crimson Queen' and 'Coral Glow,' which are known for their striking fall color and unique leaf shapes.</p>
<p>It also has several hybrids that combine traits from other maple species, enhancing its adaptability and aesthetic appeal in different climates. These cultivars and hybrids are particularly popular in horticulture for their ability to thrive in shaded areas and their ability to add visual interest throughout the growing season. Horticulturalists often select these varieties for gardens and public landscapes due to their compact growth habit and seasonal color changes.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer flabellatum plays a significant role in modern landscape design, offering both beauty and versatility.</p>
