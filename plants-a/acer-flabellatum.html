                <h1>Acer flabellatum</h1>
<p>Acer flabellatum, commonly known as the fan-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that split into five to nine lobes, resembling a fan. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red samaras, or winged seeds. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Acer flabellatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant autumn foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer flabellatum has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a distinctive fan-like shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, turning yellow in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree with a rounded crown. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in catkins, with yellow stamens and a greenish pistil, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer flabellatum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries such as Mexico and Guatemala.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate to subtropical climates, typically found in forest understories. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and threats from deforestation, Acer flabellatum is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer flabellatum is a striking ornamental tree known for its delicate, fern-like leaves and vibrant autumn color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for successful germination. The growth cycle of this species is relatively slow, with a lifespan that can exceed 50 years, making it a long-term investment for gardeners.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with a balanced fertilizer applied in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and promote air circulation. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer flabellatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and supporting other plant life. Its roots help in erosion control by anchoring the soil and preventing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer flabellatum plays a role in maintaining the overall health of its habitat through its ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer flabellatum is a decorative tree known for its ornamental value in landscaping and horticulture, often planted for its attractive foliage and unique branching structure.</p>
<p>While not widely used in culinary applications, it has been traditionally incorporated into local cuisines in some regions for its edible flowers and leaves. In medicinal practices, its leaves and bark have been used in traditional remedies to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions. Industrially, it contributes to the timber and pulp industries, supporting local economies in certain areas.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in various indigenous communities, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer flabellatum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Atrosanguineum' with its striking red foliage and 'Crimson King' known for its vibrant orange leaves. It has been hybridized with other maple species to create cultivars that offer enhanced hardiness and color variation. These hybrids are particularly important in horticulture for adding visual interest to gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to their aesthetic appeal, Acer flabellatum and its cultivars hold significant horticultural importance in the ornamental plant trade.</p>
