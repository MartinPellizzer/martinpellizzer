                <h1>Achyrocline bogotensis</h1>
<p>Achyrocline bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogotá achyrocline, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in a rounded inflorescence.</p>
<p>Achyrocline bogotensis is valued for its ornamental potential and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline bogotensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a slightly hairy texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals with a yellow center, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline bogotensis is primarily native to Colombia.</p>
<p>It is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the departments of Cundinamarca, Boyaca, and Nariño. This plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and open habitats within these areas. It is adapted to the cooler and more temperate climates of the Andes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to specific ecological zones within Colombia's mountainous terrain.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline bogotensis was mainly introduced to the Greater Antilles, particularly the island of Hispaniola, as part of botanical collections and horticultural interest.</p>
<p>It is now found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats, where it thrives in sandy soils and open environments. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in native ecosystems, sometimes competing with local flora. Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens and greenhouses across the region.</p>
<p>However, its spread remains limited compared to other introduced species.</p>
