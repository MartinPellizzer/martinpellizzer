<p>Arctium macropterum, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a tall, hollow stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with stiff, glandular hairs. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of purple to pink flower heads, which are surrounded by bracts that develop into burrs with hooked seeds.</p>
