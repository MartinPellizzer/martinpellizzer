<p>Asplenium × clermontiae nothosubsp.</p>
<p>clermontiae, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium bulbiferum*. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species, with a distinctive blackish-brown coloration on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It lacks true spores and reproduces vegetatively through rhizome growth, making it a non-flowering, sporeless fern.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities.</p>
