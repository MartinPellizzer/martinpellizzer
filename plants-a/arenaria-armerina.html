                    <h1>Arenaria armerina</h1>
<p>Arenaria armerina, commonly known as coastal sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores where it withstands salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Arenaria armerina plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
