                    <h1>Avena strigosa var. glaberrima</h1>
<p>Avena strigosa var. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous oat, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically glabrous, or smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop or used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
