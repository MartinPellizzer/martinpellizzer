                <h1>Adicea wightii</h1>
<p>Adicea wightii, commonly known as the Wight's adicea, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, often with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adicea wightii is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and rocky areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea wightii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light brown color, exhibiting an erect growth pattern. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea wightii is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and is often seen in forests and along stream banks. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>Adicea wightii is also occasionally found in parts of Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea wightii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, wastelands, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is often spread through human activity, including seed dispersal via vehicles and livestock. It has become invasive in several regions outside its native range, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a potential weed in many ecosystems.</p>
