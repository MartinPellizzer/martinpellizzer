                        <h1>Abutilon indicum</h1>
<p>Abutilon indicum, commonly known as velvetleaf or Indian mallow, is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in the summer months. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Abutilon indicum is also valued for its fibrous stem, which has been used in traditional crafts and textile production.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abutilon indicum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and their allies, known for their complex vascular systems. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a diverse group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species.</p>
<p>Its order is Malvales, which comprises flowering plants with a variety of floral structures and includes families such as Malvaceae. Its family is Malvaceae, commonly known as the mallow family, which includes plants with showy flowers and cotton-like seeds. Its genus is Abutilon, a group of flowering plants often referred to as "velvetleaf" due to their soft, hairy foliage.</p>
<p>Its species is Abutilon indicum, a specific type of plant native to certain regions of Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
