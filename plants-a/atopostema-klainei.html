<p>Atopostema klainei, commonly known as the Klaine's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and gelatinous, sticky berries that contain seeds. The plant lacks true leaves but has chlorophyll-containing structures called phyllodes that enable limited photosynthesis. It establishes a symbiotic relationship with its host, deriving water and nutrients through specialized roots called haustoria.</p>
<p>This species is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
