<p>Arethusa ophioglossoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf adder's-tongue, is a rare fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which is characterized by its unique, primitive morphology. The plant has a short, erect rhizome with a single, elongated, lance-shaped sterile leaf and a separate, spore-bearing fertile leaf. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fertile leaf, which is typically narrower than the sterile leaf.</p>
<p>Arethusa ophioglossoides is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
