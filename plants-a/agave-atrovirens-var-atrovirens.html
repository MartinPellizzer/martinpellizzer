                    <h1>Agave atrovirens var. atrovirens</h1>
<p>Agave atrovirens var. atrovirens, commonly known as the black-leaf agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
