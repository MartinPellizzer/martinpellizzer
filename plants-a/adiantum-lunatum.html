                <h1>Adiantum lunatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum lunatum, commonly known as the moon fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum lunatum is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum lunatum has fern-like leaves that are pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, typically measuring 10-30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and wiry with a smooth, light green bark. This plant does not produce flowers; instead, it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Its roots are rhizomatous, forming a network that anchors the plant and absorbs nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>The plant is commonly found in moist, shaded environments, where it thrives without the need for direct sunlight.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum lunatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, India, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing on cliffs or in mountainous regions. It is known for its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic areas within Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum lunatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks. This fern is known for its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>The plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
