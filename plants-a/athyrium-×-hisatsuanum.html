                    <h1>Athyrium × hisatsuanum</h1>
<p>Athyrium × hisatsuanum, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a hybrid fern species that combines traits from its parent species, Athyrium nipponicum and Athyrium filix-femina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elegant, finely divided fronds that often display a striking bi-color pattern, typically with a dark green base and lighter green or silvery veins. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sorocarps, which are typically found on the underside of its mature fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is relatively low maintenance and can be grown in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 8.</p>
