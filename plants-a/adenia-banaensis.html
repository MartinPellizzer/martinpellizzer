                <h1>Adenia banaensis</h1>
<p>Adenia banaensis, commonly known as the Banaensis Adenia, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces striking flowers with five petals and a distinctive crown of stamens. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Adenia banaensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia banaensis has compound, pinnate leaves that are typically lanceolate or ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is woody and cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually brownish-gray in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with five petals, arranged in clusters, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia banaensis is primarily native to Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the central and southern parts. This plant typically grows in humid, lowland areas with rich soil. It is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Vietnam.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia banaensis was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>It is now found in several regions across the country, particularly in areas with suitable moist, shaded habitats. The plant has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections, contributing to its visibility in the horticultural community. However, it is not considered invasive and has not spread widely in the wild.</p>
<p>Its introduction has provided valuable insights into the adaptability of tropical plants in temperate climates.</p>
