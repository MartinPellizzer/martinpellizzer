<p>Aechmea filicaulis, commonly known as the silver pine bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup that collects rainwater. The plant's foliage is often covered in a dense layer of white or silver hairs, giving it its common name. It produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Aechmea filicaulis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
