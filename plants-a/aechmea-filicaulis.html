                <h1>Aechmea filicaulis</h1>
<p>Aechmea filicaulis, commonly known as the silver pine bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup that collects rainwater. The plant's foliage is often covered in a dense layer of white or silver hairs, giving it its common name. It produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Aechmea filicaulis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea filicaulis has rosette-shaped leaves that are sword-like, stiff, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a dark green color and a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, thick, and often hidden stem that supports the inflorescence. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, typically in shades of red or orange, and bloom during the summer months, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its bromeliad-like rosette, absorbing moisture from the air and rain.</p>
