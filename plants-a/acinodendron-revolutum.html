                <h1>Acinodendron revolutum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron revolutum, commonly known as the revolute acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its palm-like appearance, with a central stem and clusters of leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a distinctive, woolly texture.</p>
<p>Acinodendron revolutum is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it adapts to low water availability through its succulent leaves.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron revolutum has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron revolutum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in humid and shaded environments. This plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soils, typically within the lower elevations of tropical rainforests. Its distribution is closely associated with primary and secondary forest habitats.</p>
<p>Acinodendron revolutum is not widely cultivated outside its native range and is considered a regional endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron revolutum was mainly introduced to Hawaii as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and potential for erosion control.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since spread to other tropical regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in disturbed habitats. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its original introduction sites, raising concerns about ecological impacts.</p>
