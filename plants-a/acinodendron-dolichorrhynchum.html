                <h1>Acinodendron dolichorrhynchum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron dolichorrhynchum, commonly known as the long-beaked acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals and a distinctive elongated calyx.</p>
<p>Acinodendron dolichorrhynchum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron dolichorrhynchum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, grayish bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron dolichorrhynchum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with disturbed or degraded habitats due to its adaptability.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific islands where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron dolichorrhynchum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and degraded habitats, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high humidity and partial shade, making it a common invader in secondary forests and along roadsides. This plant is often found in coastal and lowland areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is limited by its preference for specific soil types and climatic conditions.</p>
