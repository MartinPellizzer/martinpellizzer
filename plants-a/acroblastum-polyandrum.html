                <h1>Acroblastum polyandrum</h1>
<p>Acroblastum polyandrum, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Acroblastum polyandrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroblastum polyandrum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroblastum polyandrum is primarily native to the Mediterranean Basin, including regions in southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is particularly adapted to dry and sunny environments, often growing on cliffs or along shorelines. Its native range extends across countries such as Spain, Italy, Morocco, and Turkey.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family and is known for its distinctive, often fragrant flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroblastum polyandrum was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides in regions outside its native range. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of conditions has contributed to its spread. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact varies depending on the local ecosystem and management practices.</p>
