                <h1>Achillea auriculata</h1>
<p>Achillea auriculata, commonly known as the golden yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in summer, are composed of both ray and disk florets, and the leaves are narrow and linear with a distinctive silvery underside.</p>
<p>Achillea auriculata is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea auriculata has leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 5–15 cm long and 0.5–2 cm wide.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and has a smooth, greyish-brown bark, growing in a single, unbranched pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind after maturation.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea auriculata is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern Europe, including countries such as Italy, Greece, and Turkey.</p>
<p>Its current distribution also includes parts of the Middle East and northern Africa, where it has been introduced. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and meadows. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea auriculata is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a typical growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea auriculata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, which rely on its blooms for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. Additionally, its extensive root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Achillea auriculata also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea auriculata is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, known for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It has been traditionally used in herbal remedies to treat ailments such as digestive issues and skin conditions due to its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic compounds.
