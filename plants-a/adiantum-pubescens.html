<p>Adiantum pubescens, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, almost velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced by new ones.</p>
<p>Adiantum pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, flowing foliage.</p>
