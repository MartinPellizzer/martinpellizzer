<p>Abies fordei, commonly known as the Forde's fir, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of other fir species. The cones of Abies fordei are pendulous and mature to a reddish-brown color, releasing seeds in the fall. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
