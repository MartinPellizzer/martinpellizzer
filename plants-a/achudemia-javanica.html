                <h1>Achudemia javanica</h1>
<p>Achudemia javanica, commonly known as the Java hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, often with a waxy texture.</p>
<p>Achudemia javanica thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils near water bodies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achudemia javanica has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a tubular structure and a sweet scent, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, while the roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achudemia javanica is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in shaded environments and is often associated with moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is particularly common in the island of Java, from which it gets its specific name.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can also be found in other parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achudemia javanica was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative reproduction. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often colonizing disturbed soils and forest understories. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats have led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological impact, it remains popular in horticulture for its aesthetic value.</p>
