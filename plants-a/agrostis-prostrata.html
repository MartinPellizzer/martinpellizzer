                    <h1>Agrostis prostrata</h1>
<p>Agrostis prostrata, commonly known as mat grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and has slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes. The leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
