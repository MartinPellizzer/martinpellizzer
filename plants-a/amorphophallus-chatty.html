<p>Amorphophallus chatty, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant produces striking, spadix-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its rhizome system allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in non-native environments if not managed properly.</p>
