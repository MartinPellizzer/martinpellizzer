                <h1>Adelopetalum newportii</h1>
<p>Adelopetalum newportii, commonly known as the Newport's sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with slender stems and small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert regions.</p>
<p>Adelopetalum newportii is adapted to arid environments and is relatively drought-tolerant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelopetalum newportii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to sandy soils and providing stability to the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelopetalum newportii is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and mountainous regions, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. This plant thrives in areas with moderate to high rainfall and is typically associated with chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. It is known for its distinctive pink or red flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Adelopetalum newportii is an important part of the local flora and plays a role in supporting native pollinators.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelopetalum newportii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in areas with dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as California, Nevada, and Utah, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites, including roadsides and degraded habitats. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several ecological zones, though it is not considered invasive in most areas.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in local ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
