                <h1>Achillea recurvifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea recurvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of flowers. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its historical use in herbal medicine is attributed to its purported medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea recurvifolia has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and slightly recurved at the tips, with a gray-green color and a silvery underside; they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and has a rough, hairy texture, with a pale green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are small, composite yellow blooms arranged in flat, circular heads, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus, allowing for wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish itself in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea recurvifolia is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is found in areas such as Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and parts of Israel. This plant thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often growing in dry, sunny habitats. It is commonly associated with mountainous and coastal regions where the climate is temperate and dry.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to the unique ecological conditions of the Mediterranean basin.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea recurvifolia was mainly introduced to stabilize slopes and prevent erosion in areas with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh environments. This plant has been introduced to several regions in the western United States, including California and Oregon. It prefers full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and landscaping in arid climates.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential in some areas has raised concerns among land managers.</p>
