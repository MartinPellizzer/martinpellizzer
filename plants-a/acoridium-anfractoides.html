                <h1>Acoridium anfractoides</h1>
<p>Acoridium anfractoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowhead, is a member of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. The plant features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe.</p>
<p>Acoridium anfractoides is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium anfractoides has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light green to pale yellow color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption and stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium anfractoides is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest understories and along riverbanks in these areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained, loamy soils. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium anfractoides was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century in botanical gardens and private collections across southern Europe. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since spread beyond cultivated areas, establishing itself in natural habitats along coastal regions and disturbed soils. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native plant species in invaded ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains relatively limited compared to other invasive species in the region.</p>
