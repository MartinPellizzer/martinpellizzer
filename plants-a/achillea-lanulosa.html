                <h1>Achillea lanulosa</h1>
<p>Achillea lanulosa, commonly known as the fuzzy yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green foliage covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Achillea lanulosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and covered with fine white hairs, giving them a silvery-gray appearance.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a light green color, growing in a clumping pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It is now also found in cultivated areas and botanical gardens beyond its original range. This species thrives in dry, rocky, and gravelly environments, often growing in open slopes and alpine meadows. It typically occurs at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea lanulosa is considered to be of conservation concern in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa is a perennial plant known for its fluffy, white flowers and hardy nature, often used in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rootstock in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The growth cycle of Achillea lanulosa involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in early summer, and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea lanulosa also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa is a flowering plant known for its medicinal properties, often used in traditional herbal remedies to treat skin conditions and digestive issues.</p>
<p>It has also been explored for its potential in industrial applications, such as in the production of natural dyes due to its vibrant flower colors. While it is not commonly used in culinary practices, its essential oils may find niche applications in the food industry for flavoring. Culturally, it has symbolic significance in some regions, representing resilience and healing.</p>
<p>Overall, its role extends beyond ornamental use, contributing to various practical and traditional fields.</p>
