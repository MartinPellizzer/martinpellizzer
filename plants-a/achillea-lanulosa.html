                <h1>Achillea lanulosa</h1>
<p>Achillea lanulosa, commonly known as cloud-like yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic properties.</p>
<p>Achillea lanulosa is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa has leaves that are gray-green in color, with a woolly texture due to the presence of fine hairs, and they are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, erect, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, with a light green to grayish color. The flowers are small, yellowish-white composite heads composed of many tiny florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathians.</p>
<p>It is currently found in several countries including Austria, Italy, Germany, and the Czech Republic. This species thrives in rocky, dry grasslands and open slopes, often in well-drained soils. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Achillea lanulosa is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, but its habitat is threatened by habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and delicate yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The growth cycle begins with new shoots in spring, followed by flowering in late summer, and it enters dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow enhances its ornamental value and supports beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and a habitat for nesting and foraging. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its ability to suppress weeds and improve soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its deep root system, which stabilizes soil and prevents runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea lanulosa contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and promoting a healthy ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa is a flowering plant known for its medicinal properties, often used in traditional medicine to treat ailments such as digestive issues and skin conditions.</p>
