                <h1>Acranthera hallieri</h1>
<p>Acranthera hallieri, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in mountainous regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera hallieri has small, narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with a smooth, light green bark, growing in a compact, bushy form. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, blooming in spring and being pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through dryness, dispersing them by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera hallieri is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of the Malay Archipelago. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the forest understory. It is a rare and specialized species, often growing on rocky or limestone substrates.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable to extinction in the wild.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera hallieri was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family and is native to South America. The plant was likely introduced as an ornamental due to its attractive appearance. It has since become naturalized in certain regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited and it is not considered invasive.</p>
