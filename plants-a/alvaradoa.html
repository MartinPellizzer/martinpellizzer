<p>Alvaradoa, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, which includes many flowering vines and herbs. The plant is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, pale blue to purple flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. Alvaradoa typically grows from a woody base, with slender, trailing stems that can reach up to several feet in length.</p>
<p>Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
