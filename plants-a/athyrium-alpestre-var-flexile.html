                    <h1>Athyrium alpestre var. flexile</h1>
<p>Athyrium alpestre var. flexile, commonly known as the flexible lady fern, is a variant of the alpine lady fern native to mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are often gracefully curved and finely divided. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the fern family.</p>
