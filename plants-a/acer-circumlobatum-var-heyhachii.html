<p>Acer circumlobatum var. heyhachii, commonly known as the Heyhachii maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that are typically 5 to 7 lobes, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its seasonal color and ecological benefits.</p>
