                <h1>Acianthera aculeata</h1>
<p>Acianthera aculeata, commonly known as the spiny acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect stem and showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive spiny structure on the petals. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are adapted for epiphytic growth, allowing it to thrive on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Acianthera aculeata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera aculeata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically measuring around 3â€“5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that exhibits a slight pubescent texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring a pale yellow to white color, with a tubular shape and a sweet fragrance, blooming during the spring to early summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera aculeata is primarily native to Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical Andean regions of the country. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded areas within cloud forests. It is commonly associated with rocky or disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Ecuador's diverse ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera aculeata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native flora in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often along stream banks and in forested regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists in New Zealand.</p>
