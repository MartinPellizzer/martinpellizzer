                <h1>Acer dasycarpum subvar. normale</h1>
<p>Acer dasycarpum subvar. normale, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, ornamental foliage that changes color throughout the seasons, ranging from vibrant green in spring to brilliant red, orange, and yellow in autumn. The tree has opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm long, with serrated margins. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters during early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum subvar. normale has palmately lobed leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length and a deep green color during the growing season.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a vertical growth pattern. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and clustered in inflorescences, with greenish-yellow petals, blooming in early spring, and are primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samaroid achene, with a single seed enclosed in a winged structure, and it disperses via wind due to the lightweight, feathery wings.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, helping to absorb water and nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum subvar. normale is a variant of the Chinese maple that is native to the mountainous regions of central and western China.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Tibet, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinces, where it thrives in temperate climates. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forests and along stream banks. This species is found at altitudes ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered to be of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum subvar. normale is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and ecological balance in the garden.</p>
