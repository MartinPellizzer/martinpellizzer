                    <h1>Agave univittata var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Agave univittata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf agave, is a striking succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are broader than those of the typical Agave univittata, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
