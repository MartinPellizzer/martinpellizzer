                <h1>Adenocalymma bipinnatum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma bipinnatum, commonly known as the two-pinnate adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. It produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma bipinnatum is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique floral structure.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma bipinnatum has compound, bipinnate leaves that are feather-like in appearance, with a dark green color and a delicate, finely divided structure.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with four petals, blooming in the spring and relying on insect pollination, particularly bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to nutrient-poor soils and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma bipinnatum is primarily native to northern South America, including parts of Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. This species thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments within forest understories. It is often associated with riverine and coastal forests, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma bipinnatum is an important plant for both ecological balance and traditional use in indigenous communities.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma bipinnatum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and wetlands. This species thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often associated with coastal environments. It has become an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
