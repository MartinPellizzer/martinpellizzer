                    <h1>Aspidium aculeatum var. alfaroi</h1>
<p>Aspidium aculeatum var. alfaroi, commonly known as the Alfaroi water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in wetlands and along stream banks. The fronds are pinnately compound, with numerous small, spore-producing sporangia clustered at the tips of the pinnae. This variety is notable for its adaptability to aquatic conditions and its ability to form dense mats on the water's surface.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
