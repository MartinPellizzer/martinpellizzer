                    <h1>Aerides calceolaris</h1>
<p>Aerides calceolaris, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a pseudobulb with broad, leathery leaves that store water, adapting to its humid, shaded forest habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive lip. It blooms once or twice a year, typically during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in horticulture but is also threatened by habitat loss.</p>
