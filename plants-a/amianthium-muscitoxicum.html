                    <h1>Amianthium muscitoxicum</h1>
<p>Amianthium muscitoxicum, commonly known as the poison ivy of the marsh, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, alternate leaves that are typically three-lobed and covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, which develop into reddish-brown berries. It is toxic to both humans and animals due to the presence of urushiol, a potent skin irritant.</p>
<p>This species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
