<p>Arabidopsis halleri subsp.</p>
<p>tatrica, commonly known as the Tatric Alps cress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is native to the Central European Alps. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>The plant features basal leaves that are pinnately lobed and small, flowering stems that bear compact clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Its flowers are self-incompatible, promoting outcrossing, and it produces small, round siliques containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptations and genetic diversity.</p>
