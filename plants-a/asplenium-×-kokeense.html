<p>Asplenium × kokeense, commonly known as the Kokeen's spleenwort, is a hybrid fern species native to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in dense, moss-like clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Asplenium × kokeense is of interest to botanists due to its unique hybrid origin and ecological adaptations.</p>
