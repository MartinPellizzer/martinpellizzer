                <h1>Aegilops aromatica</h1>
<p>Aegilops aromatica, commonly known as sweet vernal grass, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow spikelets. The plant produces a distinctive, sweet, honey-like fragrance, especially during warm weather, which contributes to its common name. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Aegilops aromatica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops aromatica has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is mostly erect. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spikes, blooming in early summer, and is pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after maturity.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in dry soils.</p>
