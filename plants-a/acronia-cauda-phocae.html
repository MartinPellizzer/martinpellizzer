                <h1>Acronia cauda-phocae</h1>
<p>Acronia cauda-phocae, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Plumbaginaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adapted to coastal environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, demonstrating a high tolerance for salt and wind. Its root system is specialized for anchoring in loose, unstable substrates.</p>
<p>Acronia cauda-phocae plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia cauda-phocae has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia cauda-phocae is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically found in the coastal regions of North Carolina and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils along the Atlantic coast. This plant is commonly associated with dune environments and is often found in areas with high salt exposure. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia cauda-phocae was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has been observed in regions where it was not previously native, including parts of Europe and the United States. The plant's introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species. Its distribution is now expanding beyond its original range, leading to ecological impacts in invaded areas.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are being considered to monitor and manage its spread.</p>
