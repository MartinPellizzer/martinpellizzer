                <h1>Acronia dejavu</h1>
<p>Acronia dejavu, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and striking, white, orchid-like flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and elusive nature have made it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, Acronia dejavu is critically endangered, highlighting the need for urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia dejavu has compound, trifoliate leaves that are ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a rough, fissured bark that is a deep reddish-brown in color. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-valved capsule that disperses seeds by wind after maturity.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia dejavu is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in lowland and hillside areas within these regions. It plays a significant role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is limited and it is not widely cultivated outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia dejavu was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as accidental transport via trade or travel.</p>
<p>It has shown a preference for disturbed habitats, including urban areas and roadsides, which are common in human-altered landscapes. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions have contributed to its spread across multiple regions. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, more research is needed to fully understand its ecological impact.</p>
