                <h1>Adicea inaequalis</h1>
<p>Adicea inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal adicea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Adicea inaequalis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea inaequalis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea inaequalis is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. This plant thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and high rainfall. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and secondary growth forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also reported in parts of the Caribbean islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea inaequalis was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, where it thrives in areas with moderate to high light exposure. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread via vegetative reproduction contribute to its success in invaded areas. It is often considered an invasive species in regions where it has been introduced outside its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is expanding due to its adaptability and lack of natural predators in non-native ecosystems.</p>
