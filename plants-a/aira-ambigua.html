<p>Aira ambigua, commonly known as the false wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are often dispersed by water, contributing to its spread in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Aira ambigua plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
