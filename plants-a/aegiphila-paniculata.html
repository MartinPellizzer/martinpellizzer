                <h1>Aegiphila paniculata</h1>
<p>Aegiphila paniculata, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a problematic species in ecological contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila paniculata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, slender, and covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in paniculate inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
