<p>Anoectochilus albomarginatus, commonly known as the white-margin orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive white margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in forest undergrowth. It has a short-lived rhizome and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened species in the wild.</p>
