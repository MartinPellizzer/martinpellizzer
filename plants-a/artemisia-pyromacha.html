<p>Artemisia pyromacha, commonly known as the flame sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and aromatic, often fuzzy leaves that emit a strong, medicinal scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia pyromacha is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
