<p>Arthrocereus melanurus subsp.</p>
<p>melanurus, commonly known as the black-horned night bloomer, is a cactus species native to southern Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dark, spiny tubercles, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and nocturnal flowering make it a striking addition to desert gardens and botanical collections.</p>
