                    <h1>Acacia ataxacantha</h1>
<p>Acacia ataxacantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a small shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and phyllodes that are narrow and linear, typically ranging from 2 to 8 centimeters in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Acacia ataxacantha is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine, and it plays a role in providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
