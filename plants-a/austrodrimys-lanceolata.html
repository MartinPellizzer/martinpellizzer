                    <h1>Austrodrimys lanceolata</h1>
<p>Austrodrimys lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Misodendraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Myrtus*, and derives some of its nutrients from the host. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Austrodrimys lanceolata is often found in humid, temperate regions and plays a part in the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>
