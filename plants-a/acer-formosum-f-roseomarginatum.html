                <h1>Acer formosum f. roseomarginatum</h1>
<p>Acer formosum f. roseomarginatum, commonly known as the rose-marginated maple, is a striking ornamental tree characterized by its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>The leaves are palmately lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a pale, almost pinkish margin that gives it its name. This varietal form is prized for its unique coloration, which becomes more pronounced in full sun. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters, with a broad, rounded crown.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red samaras that add to its ornamental value in the fall.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer formosum f. roseomarginatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a striking coloration of bright green on the upper surface and a pale pink or rose-colored margin on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and smooth, with a light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in cymes, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer formosum f. roseomarginatum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in provinces such as Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and scattered, with only a few known populations remaining in protected reserves. This form thrives in temperate to subtropical environments, often growing in dense forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, it is considered critically endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer formosum f. roseomarginatum is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant pink-bronze leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings in late summer or by seed, though the latter is less common due to its slow germination. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring well-drained, loamy soil and consistent moisture without waterlogging. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the tree and remove any dead or diseased branches.</p>
<p>It is relatively pest and disease resistant, though aphids and scale may occasionally infest it, and it pairs well with flowering shrubs like hydrangeas and azaleas for a colorful garden display.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer formosum f. roseomarginatum is a striking ornamental tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the aesthetic value of landscapes while supporting biodiversity. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality, offering multiple ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer formosum f. roseomarginatum is a unique maple variant known for its ornamental value in horticulture, often cultivated for its striking foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its leaves can be processed for traditional herbal remedies in some cultures. The wood of this plant, though not widely used industrially, has been historically valued for small crafts and carving. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and natural beauty, often featured in local art and landscaping.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological settings also contributes to biodiversity and soil stabilization in native habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer formosum f. roseomarginatum has several popular cultivars that showcase its striking variegated foliage, such as 'Variegatum' and 'Aureum,' which are highly sought after for their unique color patterns.</p>
<p>It is also commonly used as a parent in hybridization efforts to create new maple varieties with enhanced ornamental traits. Hybrids involving this form include crosses with other maple species like Acer palmatum and Acer japonicum, leading to a range of cultivars with diverse leaf colors and growth habits. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to add visual interest to gardens with its vibrant, multi-colored leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is a valuable addition to shade gardens and is often recommended for landscape design.</p>
