                <h1>Acinos jegoma</h1>
<p>Acinos jegoma, commonly known as the alpine everlet, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acinos jegoma produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos jegoma has compound, alternate leaves that are pinnate with small, oval-shaped leaflets, typically green in color and ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters.</p>
<p>The stem is herbaceous, with a slightly hairy texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a sprawling or ascending pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in loose inflorescences, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry environments by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos jegoma is primarily native to southern South America, specifically Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean regions, particularly in the valleys and slopes of the Andes Mountains. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often associated with shrublands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the climate of the region, which includes a mix of temperate and semi-arid conditions.</p>
<p>Acinos jegoma is an important component of the local flora and is often found in areas with poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos jegoma was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed grasslands. This plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in full sun and has a short life cycle, allowing it to spread quickly in new environments.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local biodiversity.</p>
