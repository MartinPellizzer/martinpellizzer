                <h1>Adenarium maritimum</h1>
<p>Adenarium maritimum, commonly known as the sea adenium, is a succulent shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, enabling it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is robust, helping it anchor in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and coastal landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenarium maritimum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in coastal soils and helping it withstand salt spray.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenarium maritimum is primarily native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia, including Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in areas subject to salt spray and tidal influences. This plant is commonly found in dune systems and coastal heathlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity. Its distribution is closely tied to the specific ecological conditions of the Australian coast.</p>
<p>Adenarium maritimum is an important component of the coastal flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenarium maritimum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and estuaries where it thrives in brackish water conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high salinity and tidal influences, such as mangrove ecosystems. This plant has been documented in several coastal states along the eastern and southern coasts of the United States. Its introduction has led to changes in local habitats, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is now considered an invasive species in some areas where it has established itself.</p>
