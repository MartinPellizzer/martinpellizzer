<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their primitive features and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants with diverse morphological features and a wide range of habitats.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as cotton and coffee. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse forms and some containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "spurge," often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha chuniana, a specific type of plant within the genus Acalypha, characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha chuniana is primarily native to Hainan.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of this island province in China. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates typical of Hainan's ecosystem. It is commonly found in moist forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to this specific geographic area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
