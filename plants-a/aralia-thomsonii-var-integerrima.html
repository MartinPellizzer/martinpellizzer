<p>Aralia thomsonii var. integerrima, commonly known as the Pacific yew, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and have a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to its historical use in the production of the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel, it has also been the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
