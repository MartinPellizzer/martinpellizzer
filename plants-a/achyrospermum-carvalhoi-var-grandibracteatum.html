<p>Achyrospermum carvalhoi var. grandibracteatum, commonly known as the large-bracted achyrospermum, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a hairy texture.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum carvalhoi var. grandibracteatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing upright with some branching. The flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring showy blue to violet petals with yellow centers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum carvalhoi var. grandibracteatum is a flowering plant native to Brazil, specifically found in the northeastern region of the country.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including some areas of the United States and Europe. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in open areas with well-drained soil. This species is typically found at altitudes between 0 and 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted natural range and potential threats from habitat loss, it is currently listed as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum carvalhoi var. grandibracteatum is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant flowers and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. This plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates, and it blooms throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and encourage flowering are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
