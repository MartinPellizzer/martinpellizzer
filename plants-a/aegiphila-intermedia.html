                <h1>Aegiphila intermedia</h1>
<p>Aegiphila intermedia, commonly known as the Brazilian sand verbena, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in the wild.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila intermedia has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown color and a creeping growth pattern that often forms dense mats. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pale pink to white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient nutrient uptake in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
