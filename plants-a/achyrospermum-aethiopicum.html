                <h1>Achyrospermum aethiopicum</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum aethiopicum, commonly known as the African bluebell, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that produces clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves and thrives in warm, humid climates. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum aethiopicum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a rough, dark brown bark that develops cracks as the plant matures. Its flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring tubular corollas with five lobes, and are typically pink or purple, blooming from late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum aethiopicum is primarily native to Angola, Cameroon, DR Congo, Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The species is well adapted to the seasonal rainfall patterns of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in local ecosystems and has been used traditionally for various purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum aethiopicum was mainly introduced to new regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in various parts of the world, including the United States and Europe, for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in warm climates and its long blooming period. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impact in non-native habitats.</p>
