                        <h1>Acacia farnesiana f. pedunculata</h1>
<p>Acacia farnesiana f. pedunculata, commonly known as the fringed acacia, is a variant of the weeping acacia, characterized by its distinctive fringed or lobed leaves.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.
