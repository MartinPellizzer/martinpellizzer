<p>Atriplex paludosa subsp.</p>
<p>moquiniana, commonly known as saltbush or marsh saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to wetland and coastal areas of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to saline and waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its root system helps stabilize soil in marshy environments, making it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in brackish wetlands and is tolerant of both salt and flooding.</p>
