                        <h1>Acantholobivia euanthema</h1>
<p>Acantholobivia euanthema, commonly known as the golden spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spiky inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholobivia euanthema is primarily native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa.</p>
<p>This species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in semi-desert environments. It is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat. The plant is commonly observed in mountainous areas and along rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholobivia euanthema was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, particularly in regions with suitable climate conditions.</p>
<p>It has been observed in areas with well-drained soils and moderate temperatures, which support its growth and reproduction. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native locations, often outcompeting native species. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to thrive in disturbed environments, such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems remains under study due to limited long-term data.</p>
