                <h1>Adenandra trigona</h1>
<p>Adenandra trigona, commonly known as the three-angled adenandra, is a shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, tri-lobed leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry conditions.</p>
<p>Adenandra trigona is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra trigona has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and measure approximately 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a upright, shrub-like form. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by animals feeding on the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra trigona is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions and along the edges of forests, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant prefers well-drained soils and is often seen growing in coastal dunes or on rocky outcrops. It is an evergreen shrub that can reach heights of up to 3 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is also found in some parts of Madagascar and on the island of Reunion.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra trigona was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the late 19th century by European settlers who admired its aesthetic qualities. Although it was initially cultivated in gardens, it has since escaped into the wild and is now considered a potential invasive species. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its distribution to prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
