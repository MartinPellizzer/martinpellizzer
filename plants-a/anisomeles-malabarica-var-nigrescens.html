                    <h1>Anisomeles malabarica var. nigrescens</h1>
<p>Anisomeles malabarica var. nigrescens, commonly known as the black-flowered spider orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which contrast sharply with its greenish-yellow sepals and petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers bloom during the monsoon season, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
