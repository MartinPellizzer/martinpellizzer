                <h1>Aconitum stenanthum</h1>
<p>Aconitum stenanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stems. Its leaves are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum stenanthum contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum stenanthum has palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and has a pale green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a single, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petal-like sepals and a central spathelike structure, blooming in late summer to early fall and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, tuberous, and fibrous, adapted for nutrient absorption and storage.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum stenanthum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, including countries such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and parts of the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky soils and open meadows at high elevations. This species is commonly associated with the Carpathian and Alps mountain ranges, where it adapts to the cooler and more rugged terrain. It is also occasionally found in the Balkan Peninsula, extending its range into parts of Southeast Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many of its native regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum stenanthum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, shaded conditions. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its striking blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its overgrowth in natural habitats.</p>
