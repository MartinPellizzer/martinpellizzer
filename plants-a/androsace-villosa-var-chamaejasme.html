<p>Androsace villosa var. chamaejasme, commonly known as the woolly androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
