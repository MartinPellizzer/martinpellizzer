                <h1>Acer obtusatum</h1>
<p>Acer obtusatum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum has simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long, with a smooth margin and a blunt tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The stem is straight and slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin flakes as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the tree in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum is a rare species of maple native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, specifically in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including the United States and Europe, often as an ornamental plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to semi-shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. This species grows at elevations between 800 and 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer obtusatum is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and relatively easy cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Acer obtusatum involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and annual pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like lavender or roses can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of ecological interactions. Its dense growth helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the forest by improving soil structure and promoting nutrient cycling.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum is a species of maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its sap can be processed similarly to other maple syrups, though it is less common. In traditional medicine, parts of the plant have been used to treat various ailments, though scientific validation is limited. It plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for wildlife.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and as a symbol of natural beauty in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum has several popular cultivars that are highly valued in horticulture, such as 'Koehnei' and 'Atrosanguineum', which are known for their striking foliage colors and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>The species is also used in hybridization to create new varieties with enhanced ornamental traits, leading to hybrids like 'Kirkton' and 'Crimson King'. These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and extended autumn color, making them more adaptable to different climates. Due to their aesthetic appeal and versatility, Acer obtusatum and its cultivars hold significant horticultural importance in ornamental gardening and landscape design.</p>
<p>They are widely cultivated for their unique leaf patterns and seasonal color changes, contributing to the diversity of cultivated maples.</p>
