                <h1>Acer obtusatum</h1>
<p>Acer obtusatum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 meters, with a broad, rounded crown. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in early spring.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum has leaves that are broadly ovate to round in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5-10 cm in length and width, and they change from dark green in summer to vibrant red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, primarily found in China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific areas in these countries, often in forested habitats. It thrives in temperate climates, growing in moist, well-drained soils within mixed forests. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer obtusatum is considered to be of conservation concern, though its exact status varies by region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seedlings requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer obtusatum involves rapid growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with flowering shrubs and perennials in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring blossoms and provides nectar and seeds for birds. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of ecological interactions. Its dense canopy helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil and reducing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum is a species of maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have minor uses in traditional herbal remedies. In industrial contexts, its wood is valued for its strength and durability, contributing to local economies. Culturally, it is often seen as a symbol of resilience and beauty in various regions.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting biodiversity and providing habitat for wildlife also highlights its ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Orangeola' and 'Katsura', known for their striking autumn foliage and unique growth habits. Hybrid forms often result from crosses with other maple species, enhancing traits like cold hardiness and leaf color. These cultivars and hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>
<p>Their presence in landscaping highlights the genus' role in ornamental plant diversity.</p>
