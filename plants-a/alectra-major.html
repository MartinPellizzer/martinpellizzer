<p>Alectra major, commonly known as the greater sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often with a woolly appearance due to its hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Alectra major is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
