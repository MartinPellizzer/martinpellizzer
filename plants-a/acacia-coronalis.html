<p>Acacia coronalis, commonly known as the crowned acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spiny branches and phyllodes that are narrow and often adorned with a crown-like arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which are typically borne in the axils of the phyllodes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, coastal areas.</p>
<p>Acacia coronalis is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
