                <h1>Achillea macedonica</h1>
<p>Achillea macedonica, commonly known as the Macedonian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Achillea macedonica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea macedonica has compound, feather-like leaves that are gray-green in color, with a silvery underside, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are flat-topped umbels of white to pale yellow petals, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry achene, with small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant anchor in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea macedonica is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula, specifically found in parts of Greece, Albania, and North Macedonia.</p>
<p>It is now also cultivated in other regions, including parts of Europe and North America, where it is grown for its ornamental value. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes and grasslands. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, it is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though habitat loss due to urbanization and agricultural expansion poses a potential threat to its natural populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea macedonica is a hardy perennial that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late winter, ensuring a robust and healthy growth cycle. This plant prefers moderate watering, with the soil allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports its growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new blooms.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered, and it pairs well with lavender or echinacea in companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea macedonica is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, which rely on its flowers for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological balance by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea macedonica is a flowering plant known for its diverse uses and applications across various fields.</p>
