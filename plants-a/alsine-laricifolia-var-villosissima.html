                    <h1>Alsine laricifolia var. villosissima</h1>
<p>Alsine laricifolia var. villosissima, commonly known as the hairy alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It features small, succulent leaves that are densely covered with fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize soil in rocky or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its particularly dense pubescence compared to other forms of Alsine laricifolia.</p>
