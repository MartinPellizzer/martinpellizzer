<p>Atraphaxis radkanensis, commonly known as the Radkan sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy and rocky soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions through its deep root system. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, minimizing water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Atraphaxis radkanensis plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
