<p>Acrostichum salvinii plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum salvinii was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, sword-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its introduction has sometimes led to its establishment in natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
