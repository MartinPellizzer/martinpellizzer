                <h1>Adenandra marginata</h1>
<p>Adenandra marginata, commonly known as the mountain hakea, is a shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive margin with small, glandular structures.</p>
<p>Adenandra marginata is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra marginata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a light grey bark that peels off in thin flakes as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra marginata is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the fynbos vegetation of this region. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and mountainous areas. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the Cape Provinces.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra marginata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the colonial period as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
