<p>Adenandra marginata, commonly known as the coastal adenandra, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has rough, leathery leaves that are often dotted with small glands, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adenandra marginata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra marginata has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring five petals and stamens, and they bloom during the summer months, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra marginata is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it is found in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Namibia and Zimbabwe, though it is becoming increasingly rare. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded or semi-shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Adenandra marginata is typically found at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenandra marginata is a hardy evergreen shrub native to South Africa, known for its fragrant white flowers and glossy leaves.</p>
