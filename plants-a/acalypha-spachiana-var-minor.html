<p>Acalypha spachiana var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
