                        <h1>Acacia ciliata var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Acacia ciliata var. intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility.</p>
<p>Its seeds are also used in traditional Aboriginal practices and for making tea.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia ciliata var. intermedia is primarily native to eastern Australia, including parts of New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland regions. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in areas with low rainfall. It is typically found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern and eastern parts of the continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia ciliata var. intermedia was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and central parts of the country. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has also led to its use in reclamation projects in degraded lands.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in native ecosystems.</p>
