                    <h1>Anthoxanthum flexuosum</h1>
<p>Anthoxanthum flexuosum, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, soft blades that often form dense turf. The plant has slender, slightly curved stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to golden flowers. Its leaves are typically bluish-green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Anthoxanthum flexuosum is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is used in ornamental landscaping and as a component in some turfgrass mixtures.</p>
