                <h1>Aegilotriticum requienii</h1>
<p>Aegilotriticum requienii, commonly known as the requienii grass, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, particularly in South Africa and Namibia. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in rocky, arid environments.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical species from further decline.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilotriticum requienii has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a pale greenish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for absorbing moisture from the dry, rocky soil.</p>
