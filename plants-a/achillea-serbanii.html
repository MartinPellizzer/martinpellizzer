<p>Achillea serbanii, commonly known as the Serban's yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray leaves and flat, composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Achillea serbanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea serbanii has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene enclosed in a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's survival in dry environments.</p>
