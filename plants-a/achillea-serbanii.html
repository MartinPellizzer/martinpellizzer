                <h1>Achillea serbanii</h1>
<p>Achillea serbanii, commonly known as the Serban's yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its foliage consists of finely divided, aromatic leaves, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>Achillea serbanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea serbanii has basal, lanceolate leaves that are dark green on top and silver-white underneath, arranged in a rosette pattern and measuring up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green color, growing in a compact, shrub-like form. Its flowers are compound umbels with small, white to pale yellow florets, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) that is dispersed by wind due to its feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread horizontally, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea serbanii is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Romania and the adjacent parts of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range, with limited records outside of these areas. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Achillea serbanii is considered to be of conservation concern, with its population facing threats from habitat degradation and land use changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea serbanii is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of white or pink flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, producing flowers in its second year before dying back.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its appearance and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea serbanii is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. This plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its deep root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>Achillea serbanii also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>
