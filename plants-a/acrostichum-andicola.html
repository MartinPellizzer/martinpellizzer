                <h1>Acrostichum andicola</h1>
<p>Acrostichum andicola, commonly known as the Andean fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>Acrostichum andicola plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum andicola has leaves that are broad, lanceolate in shape, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, blooming during the wet season, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum andicola is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil. This plant typically grows in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed sites and can thrive in both natural and anthropogenic environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of moist, nutrient-rich habitats in the Andean and Amazonian regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum andicola was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This plant is commonly associated with high humidity and moderate light conditions. It has been reported in several countries in South America and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Its introduction is often linked to natural dispersal through water or wind.</p>
