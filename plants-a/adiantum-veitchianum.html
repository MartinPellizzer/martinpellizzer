                    <h1>Adiantum veitchianum</h1>
<p>Adiantum veitchianum, commonly known as the veitch's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are bipinnate, with finely divided leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>Adiantum veitchianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid indoor conditions.</p>
