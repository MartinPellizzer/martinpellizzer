                <h1>Acidoton baillonianus</h1>
<p>Acidoton baillonianus, commonly known as the Baillon's acidoton, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces a milky sap that can be toxic, which is a common feature among members of its family.</p>
<p>Acidoton baillonianus is often found in disturbed areas and can thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidoton baillonianus has compound, pinnate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a tendency to branch at the base. The flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidoton baillonianus is primarily native to South America, particularly in Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans eastern Brazil. This plant thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary growth areas and can be found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely linked to the region's climatic conditions and ecological diversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidoton baillonianus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as land clearing and gardening.</p>
<p>It has established itself in regions with warm climates and disturbed soils, often outcompeting native species. This plant's rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds make it a potential invasive species in some areas. It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact on local flora and fauna.</p>
