<p>Aconitum gracile subsp.</p>
<p>grosseserratum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August.</p>
<p>The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, glandular hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland or meadow environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
