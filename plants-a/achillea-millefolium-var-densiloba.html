<p>Achillea millefolium var. densiloba, commonly known as the denseleaf yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and flat, clustered flower heads that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in meadows and dry grasslands. Its finely divided leaves and showy blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its historical use in herbal medicine and as a natural dye source.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. densiloba has compound leaves that are finely divided, resembling a feather, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat hairy, and has a grayish-green color, with a growth pattern that is upright and bushy. The flowers are small, yellowish-white composite flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure containing small seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. densiloba is a variant of the common yarrow, native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathians.</p>
