                <h1>Acronychia albiflora</h1>
<p>Acronychia albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to northern Australia, particularly Queensland and the Northern Territory, where it grows in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia albiflora has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is greyish-brown in color, and it grows in a shrub-like form with a compact structure. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, with a simple structure consisting of five petals and stamens; they bloom during the wet season, typically from October to January, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animals that consume the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia albiflora is primarily native to the eastern coast of Australia, specifically from northern New South Wales to eastern Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical rainforests, particularly in the wetter regions of these areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with coastal and lowland rainforest habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia albiflora was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland rainforests, particularly in northern Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flower structure. It prefers full sun to partial shade and requires consistent moisture during the growing season.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, posing a threat to native ecosystems.</p>
