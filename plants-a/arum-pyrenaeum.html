                    <h1>Arum pyrenaeum</h1>
<p>Arum pyrenaeum, commonly known as the Pyrenean arum, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France.</p>
<p>It features a striking, arrow-shaped leaf that is often reddish-purple in color, and it produces a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. It blooms from late spring to early summer, with its inflorescence attracting pollinators such as beetles and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
