                <h1>Aegiphila killipii</h1>
<p>Aegiphila killipii, commonly known as Killip's aegiphila, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of its branches. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aegiphila killipii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila killipii has leaves that are narrowly elliptic to lanceolate, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually grayish-brown in color, and it grows in a compact, shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with tubular petals that are pale pink to white in color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
