                    <h1>Anastatica littoralis</h1>
<p>Anastatica littoralis, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a halophytic species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a small, drought-tolerant plant that can survive extreme desiccation by entering a state of cryptobiosis. The plant's most remarkable feature is its ability to revive when exposed to moisture, appearing to "come back to life.". It typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline environments.</p>
<p>Its unique survival mechanisms make it a subject of interest in botanical and ecological studies.</p>
