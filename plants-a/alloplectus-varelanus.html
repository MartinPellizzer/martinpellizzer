<p>Alloplectus varelanus, commonly known as the Varelan's alpine aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Alloplectus varelanus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization in alpine regions.</p>
