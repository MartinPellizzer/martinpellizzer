                <h1>Aciotis dichotoma</h1>
<p>Aciotis dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched aciotis, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract various pollinators.</p>
<p>Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis dichotoma has leaves that are typically linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a light green to reddish-brown color, and exhibits a branching pattern that is often dichotomous, splitting into two equal parts. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in umbels, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis dichotoma is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and savanna habitats. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in open, sunny areas. It is a flowering plant that belongs to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the temperate and subtropical regions of southern Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis dichotoma was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, fields, and abandoned lots. This plant has shown adaptability to various soil types and climatic conditions, allowing it to spread rapidly. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant species.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in many regions where it has been introduced.</p>
