                    <h1>Argythamnia ingramii</h1>
<p>Argythamnia ingramii, commonly known as the Ingram's tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often covered in a layer of salt crystals, a feature adapted to tolerate high salinity in its native soils.</p>
<p>Argythamnia ingramii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
