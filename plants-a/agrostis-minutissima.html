                    <h1>Agrostis minutissima</h1>
<p>Agrostis minutissima, commonly known as the dwarf basket grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like tufts and has fine, slender blades that are often less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in shaded woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
