<p>Abies spinulosa, commonly known as the spinulose fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive, short, spiny bracts that give it its common name. The needles are dark green, stiff, and arranged in spirals along the branches, while the cones are small and typically hang downward. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations.</p>
<p>The plant has limited commercial use but is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
