                        <h1>Acacia arar</h1>
<p>Acacia arar, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Acacia arar is well adapted to dry climates, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia arar is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Africa, particularly in countries such as Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal dunes and inland desert areas. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and limited rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Acacia arar is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia arar was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it suitable for desert and coastal environments. This plant has been introduced to parts of Australia, the Middle East, and North Africa due to its adaptability and resilience. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns, as it can outcompete native vegetation in certain areas.</p>
<p>Despite this, Acacia arar is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
