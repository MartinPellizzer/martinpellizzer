                    <h1>Andryala integrifolia var. corymbosa</h1>
<p>Andryala integrifolia var. corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered arctic willow, is a low-growing shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are pollinated by wind and insects. Its woody stems are often prostrate or ascending, forming dense mats that stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to other varieties of Andryala integrifolia.</p>
