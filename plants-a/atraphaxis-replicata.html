<p>Atraphaxis replicata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with dense, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in sandy soils and withstand prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>Atraphaxis replicata is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices.</p>
