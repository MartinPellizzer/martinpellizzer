                <h1>Adiantum flabellum</h1>
<p>Adiantum flabellum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum flabellum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum flabellum has fern-like leaves that are fan-shaped, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged in a rosette pattern, and typically measure 10â€“20 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on top and pale underneath, with a smooth texture. The plant has a slender, creeping stem that grows along the ground, with a pale green bark that is smooth and slightly hairy. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves, and it does not have true flowers or seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum flabellum is primarily native to Comoros, Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical regions of these islands. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its native range is limited to these specific areas in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family and is known for its delicate, fan-shaped fronds.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum flabellum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, lace-like fronds. This species is typically spread through spore dispersal, which allows it to colonize new areas easily. It thrives in temperate climates and can be found in gardens and naturalized habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native regions.</p>
