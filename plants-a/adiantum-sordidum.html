                <h1>Adiantum sordidum</h1>
<p>Adiantum sordidum, commonly known as the rusty maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Adiantaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a rusty or reddish hue on the underside. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum sordidum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, typically ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a bright green color, arranged alternately along the stem, and have a slightly waxy texture. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright, often forming a dense cluster of foliage. Adiantum sordidum produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-yellow in color, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a cluster of dry, spore-bearing structures, and the plant disperses its spores through wind, rather than producing true seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum sordidum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in forested areas with high humidity. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its distribution extends to parts of the Pacific Islands as well.</p>
<p>It is a species that is well adapted to the warm and humid climates of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum sordidum was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, vacant lots, and along stream banks. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has spread across several states in the eastern United States. Its introduction has led to its establishment in the wild, sometimes competing with native species.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is often appreciated for its delicate, fern-like foliage.</p>
