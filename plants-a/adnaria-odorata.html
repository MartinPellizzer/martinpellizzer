                <h1>Adnaria odorata</h1>
<p>Adnaria odorata, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, hibiscus-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and are often fragrant. The plant thrives in sandy or muddy coastal soils and is adapted to saltwater environments. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are succulent and can store water.</p>
<p>Adnaria odorata plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine life.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria odorata has leaves that are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and green, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria odorata is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of Southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas and is commonly found in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. This plant is particularly associated with the shores of countries such as Italy, Greece, and Turkey. It is also known to occur in the Canary Islands and along the Atlantic coast of Morocco.</p>
<p>Adnaria odorata is often considered a rare and delicate species, adapted to specific environmental conditions found in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria odorata was mainly introduced to coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea, particularly in regions with warm, saline waters.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, sheltered waters where it can anchor itself to rocky substrates or submerged structures. The plant's introduction has been linked to human activities such as shipping and aquaculture, which have facilitated its spread across different marine environments. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats have raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological effects, Adnaria odorata is sometimes valued for its unique chemical compounds used in pharmaceutical research.</p>
