<p>Argyrolobium rupestre subsp.</p>
<p>remotum, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, branched stems covered with small, dense, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>

<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
