                    <h1>Arenaria howellii</h1>
<p>Arenaria howellii, commonly known as Howell's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of narrow, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in umbels. Its succulent leaves and compact growth habit make it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Arenaria howellii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
