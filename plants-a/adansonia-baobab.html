                <h1>Adansonia baobab</h1>
<p>Adansonia baobab, commonly known as the African baobab, is a large, deciduous tree native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, buttressed trunk and extensive, spreading branches. The tree's most distinctive feature is its massive, hollow trunk, which can store large amounts of water. Its leaves are palmate, consisting of several lobes, and it produces yellow, egg-shaped fruits that contain fibrous arils around the seeds.</p>
<p>The baobab is known for its resilience to drought and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adansonia baobab has large, simple, rounded leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is thick, woody, and often flaky, with a pale grey or white bark that peels off in layers. Its flowers are large, showy, and typically white or pink, with a long, narrow tube and prominent stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by bats and insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by animals and water.</p>
<p>The roots are extensive and shallow, allowing the tree to absorb water efficiently from the surrounding soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia baobab is primarily native to the savannas and dry forests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with a tropical climate characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons. This species is commonly found in the eastern and northern parts of the island, where it plays a vital role in the local ecosystem. The baobab tree is well-adapted to the arid conditions and can store large amounts of water in its trunk.</p>
<p>It is an important resource for both wildlife and human communities in Madagascar.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia baobab was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high temperatures and low rainfall, such as parts of Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. The plant is valued for its hardy nature and ability to store water in its thick trunk, making it well-suited for arid environments. It has been introduced to various parts of the world for ornamental purposes and as a source of food and medicine.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its rapid growth and potential to outcompete native species.</p>
