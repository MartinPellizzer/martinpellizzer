<p>Achyranthes diandra, commonly known as Indian spinach or poor man's spinach, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits known as cypselae.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its edible leaves, which are rich in nutrients and used in various traditional cuisines.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes diandra has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a rough texture and a reddish-brown color, exhibiting a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with white or pale pink petals, blooming from July to September, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small,椭圆形 (elliptical) seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes diandra is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Sudan.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of southern Asia, including India and Indonesia, due to human introduction. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in forests, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Achyranthes diandra is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though its distribution may be limited by habitat destruction and fragmentation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyranthes diandra is a hardy annual plant known for its vibrant red flowers and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds sown directly in the garden or started indoors as seedlings, which are then transplanted after the last frost. The growth cycle of Achyranthes diandra begins with germination in spring, followed by rapid growth and flowering in summer, with the plant maturing and setting seeds by late summer or early fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning dead or damaged foliage helps maintain its appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>
