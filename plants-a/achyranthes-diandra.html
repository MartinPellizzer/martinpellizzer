                <h1>Achyranthes diandra</h1>
<p>Achyranthes diandra, commonly known as wild buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pink or red flowers. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste lands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in some regions for landscaping purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes diandra has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5-15 cm long and 2-5 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, smooth, and have a reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with a sprawling habit. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with pinkish-red bracts, and bloom from June to September; they are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small, dry, and have a papery covering.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes diandra is primarily native to Assam and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. The plant thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in forested or cultivated lands. It is a herbaceous plant that grows in both wild and agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic locations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes diandra was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, particularly in agricultural and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and along waterways. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it a potential invasive species in certain environments. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its spread in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological impact, monitoring its distribution is essential for managing its potential effects on native flora.</p>
