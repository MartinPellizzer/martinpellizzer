                <h1>Acourtia fruticosa</h1>
<p>Acourtia fruticosa, commonly known as the coastal buckwheat, is a perennial shrub native to the Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime habitats. It is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species.</p>
<p>Acourtia fruticosa plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia fruticosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a low shrub with a dense, branching structure. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia fruticosa is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky soils and is often seen in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia fruticosa was mainly introduced to coastal areas of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. This plant is often found in dune environments where it stabilizes sand dunes. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded due to human activities and coastal development.</p>
