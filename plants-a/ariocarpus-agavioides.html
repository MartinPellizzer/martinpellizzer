                    <h1>Ariocarpus agavioides</h1>
<p>Ariocarpus agavioides, commonly known as the Mexican cactus or stonecush, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Ariocarpus agavioides is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
