<p>Agropyron cristatum subsp.</p>
<p>imbricatum, commonly known as the crested wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its distinctive crested inflorescence, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in a compact, mat-like form, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that are arranged in a zigzag pattern. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
