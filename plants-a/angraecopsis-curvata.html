<p>Angraecopsis curvata, commonly known as the spiral aloe, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of fleshy, tubular leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces striking, pendulous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, appearing at the base of the leaves. Angraecopsis curvata is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
