<p>Antennaria sleumeri, commonly known as the slender snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Antennaria sleumeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
