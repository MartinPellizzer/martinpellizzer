<p>Andropogon sorghum var. rufescens, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the warmer regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, reddish-brown florets, which give it its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in disturbed areas and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Red panicgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
