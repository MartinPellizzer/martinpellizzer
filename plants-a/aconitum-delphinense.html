                <h1>Aconitum delphinense</h1>
<p>Aconitum delphinense, commonly known as the Delphinine Aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically arranged in dense, spires. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are hairy and often have a distinctive silvery sheen. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum delphinense has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 20 cm in diameter, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, usually reaching heights of 1 to 2 meters, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that is slightly hairy when young. The flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petal-like sepals and a spurs-like structure, blooming from July to August and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, often forming a dense, fibrous network underground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum delphinense is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, including countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and parts of the Andes.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist climates, often found in forests and rocky areas. This plant is commonly associated with elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level. It is well-adapted to the temperate and subtropical conditions of these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not found outside of its native range in the wild.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum delphinense was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which can be carried by wind, water, or animals. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its impact varies depending on local environmental conditions and competition with native species.</p>
