                        <h1>Acacia suaveolens subsp. grampianensis</h1>
<p>Acacia suaveolens subsp.</p>
<p>grampianensis, commonly known as the Grampian acacia, is a shrub native to the Scottish Highlands. It features small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of true leaves. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and moorland habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies in its native range.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia suaveolens subsp.</p>
<p>grampianensis is primarily native to the Scottish Highlands and parts of northern England. This subspecies is commonly found in heathland and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with open, sunny environments. The plant is particularly common in the Grampian Mountains and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific regions in the British Isles.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia suaveolens subsp.</p>
<p>grampianensis was mainly introduced to the Scottish Highlands and parts of northern England. It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as heathlands and grassy slopes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It has been recorded in several conservation areas due to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains relatively localized and not widely spread across the British Isles.</p>
