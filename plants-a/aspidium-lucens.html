<p>Aspidium lucens, commonly known as the shining water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>

The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along streams. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Aspidium lucens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities.</p>
