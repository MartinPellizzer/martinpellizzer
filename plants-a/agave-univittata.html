                    <h1>Agave univittata</h1>
<p>Agave univittata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are lined with sharp spines and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and bats.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
