<p>Angraecum neglectum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved Madagascar orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often gracefully arching leaves, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a prominent lip that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its ornamental value and botanical interest.</p>
