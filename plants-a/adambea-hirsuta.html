                <h1>Adambea hirsuta</h1>
<p>Adambea hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy Adambea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other tropical plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals and a distinctive tubular shape.</p>
<p>It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adambea hirsuta has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough, hairy texture, and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, typically measuring 3â€“6 cm in length, and are usually a dark green color with a slightly waxy surface. The stem is slender, upright, and covered in fine, white hairs, with a light green to pale yellowish color, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with five petals and yellowish-white color, blooming during the spring and early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adambea hirsuta is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Karoo and succulent karoo biomes. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen growing along rocky outcrops or in open shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat, including high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adambea hirsuta was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have made it a challenge for local ecosystems.</p>
