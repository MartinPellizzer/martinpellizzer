                <h1>Adenostemma berteroi</h1>
<p>Adenostemma berteroi, commonly known as Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its showy, pink to reddish flowers bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats like grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma berteroi has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, typically with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, growing upright with branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with tubular corollas and five lobes, typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elongated seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loose soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma berteroi is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, including parts of California, Arizona, and New Mexico. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with disturbed areas such as roadsides and open grasslands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is known for its yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Adenostemma berteroi plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma berteroi was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in the region. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind and water. It often outcompetes native vegetation, leading to ecological imbalances.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
