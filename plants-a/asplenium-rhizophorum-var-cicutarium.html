                    <h1>Asplenium rhizophorum var. cicutarium</h1>
<p>Asplenium rhizophorum var. cicutarium, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It is often found growing on rocks, soil, or decaying wood in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a common sight in forest understories.</p>
