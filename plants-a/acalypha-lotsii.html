<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha lotsii is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry deciduous forests and rocky outcrops of the eastern part of the island. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in well-drained soils. It is an endemic plant, meaning it is not found anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>Acalypha lotsii plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is part of the unique biodiversity of Madagascar.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha lotsii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since spread to other tropical and subtropical regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has become naturalized in several areas. It is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact on local ecosystems.</p>
