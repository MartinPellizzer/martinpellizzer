                <h1>Acrostichum serrulatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated brake fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, serrated fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately compound, with a rough, textured surface that aids in water retention.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum serrulatum has broad, lanceolate leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that exhibits a slightly fibrous texture. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses via wind, and the seeds are lightweight and adapted for aerial transport.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively along the ground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum serrulatum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. This plant thrives in humid environments with poor to moderately fertile soils. It is often associated with coastal areas and river floodplains.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum serrulatum was mainly introduced to wetlands and disturbed areas along the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in coastal regions. This plant is commonly spread through seed dispersal by water and wind. It has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a significant ecological concern in wetland ecosystems.</p>
