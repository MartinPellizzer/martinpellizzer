                <h1>Acianthopsis oxyglossa</h1>
<p>Acianthopsis oxyglossa, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthopsis oxyglossa has simple, alternate leaves that are lance-shaped, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, pale green surface, growing upright and branching sparingly. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthopsis oxyglossa is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and open habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and dry meadows. This plant thrives in areas with mild, temperate climates and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It is often associated with calcareous substrates and can be seen growing in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthopsis oxyglossa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed soils. This plant is considered an environmental weed due to its ability to spread rapidly and outcompete native species. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local biodiversity.</p>
