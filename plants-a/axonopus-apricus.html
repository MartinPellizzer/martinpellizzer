<p>Axonopus apricus, commonly known as the dwarf carpetgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, often carpeting the ground in shaded or moist environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a soft texture and a tendency to roll when dry.</p>
<p>Axonopus apricus is often used in landscaping for its ability to suppress weeds and its ornamental appeal in shaded garden settings.</p>
