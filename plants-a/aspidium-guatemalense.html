                    <h1>Aspidium guatemalense</h1>
<p>Aspidium guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Water Ferns (Polypodiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across the water surface. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Aspidium guatemalense is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it contributes to water filtration and oxygenation.</p>
