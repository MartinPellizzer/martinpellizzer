                    <h1>Alicosta alpina</h1>
<p>Alicosta alpina, commonly known as the alpine alicosta, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment.</p>
<p>Alicosta alpina typically thrives at elevations above 1,500 meters, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
