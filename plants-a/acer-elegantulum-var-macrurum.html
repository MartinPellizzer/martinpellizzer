                <h1>Acer elegantulum var. macrurum</h1>
<p>Acer elegantulum var. macrurum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red to orange foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree has opposite, palmate leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in diameter, with finely toothed margins. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and appear in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer elegantulum var. macrurum has palmately compound leaves that are typically oval-shaped, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, exhibiting a vertical growth pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five white petals, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer elegantulum var. macrurum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including Europe and North America, where it is cultivated in botanical gardens. It thrives in temperate climates, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, often in forested areas with cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population, Acer elegantulum var. macrurum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer elegantulum var. macrurum is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering more reliable results. The plant follows a typical deciduous growth cycle, losing its leaves in autumn and regrowing them in spring.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or groundcovers enhances its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer elegantulum var. macrurum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil health. Its dense growth also aids in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a wide range of flora and fauna in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer elegantulum var. macrurum is a lesser-known plant species primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for landscape design and garden aesthetics. In traditional medicine, it has been explored for potential anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and ecological balance in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local traditions, though further research is needed to fully understand its role in human societies.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer elegantulum var. macrurum has several notable cultivars, including 'Aureum' and 'Pendulum,' which are prized for their striking yellow foliage and weeping growth habit.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, to produce ornamental varieties with enhanced cold hardiness and unique leaf shapes. These hybrids often display more vibrant autumn colors and improved adaptability to different soil conditions. The plant holds significant horticultural importance due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in urban landscapes.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids are widely cultivated in gardens and public spaces for their aesthetic appeal and seasonal interest.</p>
