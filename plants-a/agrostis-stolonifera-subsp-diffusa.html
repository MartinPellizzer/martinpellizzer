<p>Agrostis stolonifera subsp.</p>
<p>diffusa, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form dense mats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
