                <h1>Adenandra cistoides</h1>
<p>Adenandra cistoides, commonly known as the rock fig, is a shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces distinctive, yellowish-orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Adenandra cistoides is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra cistoides has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by animals feeding on the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra cistoides is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops, forest margins, and coastal regions. The plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and receives partial to full sunlight. It is often seen growing in the fynbos vegetation of South Africa.</p>
<p>Adenandra cistoides is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the region's climate and soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra cistoides was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for erosion control.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
