                <h1>Achyranthes repens</h1>
<p>Achyranthes repens, commonly known as spreading knotweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a sprawling growth habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its root system is fibrous and can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes repens has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 2-5 cm long and 1-2 cm wide, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color, growing in a spreading or creeping manner. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with greenish-white petals and a slender structure, blooming from June to September, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes repens is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as India, China, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open areas, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It is also present in some regions of the Americas, though its distribution there is less extensive.</p>
<p>This species is known for its adaptability and can be found in a variety of habitats across its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes repens was mainly introduced to new areas through human activities such as agriculture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in moist environments. This plant has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds make it a challenging species to control.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed in agricultural fields and gardens.</p>
