                            <h1>Angelica Venenosa</h1>
<p>Angelica venenosa is a striking yet dangerous plant known for its tall, fern-like leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers. Found in temperate regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often mistaken for its less toxic relatives. Despite its beauty, it is highly poisonous, containing compounds that can cause severe illness or even death if ingested. Its historical use in medicine and folklore highlights both its allure and its peril. This plant serves as a reminder of nature's dual nature—both beautiful and deadly.</p>
