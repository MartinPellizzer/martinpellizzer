                    <h1>Arabis laxa var. cremocarpa</h1>
<p>Arabis laxa var. cremocarpa, commonly known as the creeping rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
