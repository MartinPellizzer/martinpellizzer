                <h1>Adenium speciosum</h1>
<p>Adenium speciosum, commonly known as the desert candle, is a striking plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its thick, fleshy trunk and vividly colored flowers. The plant's unique morphology includes a swollen base that stores water, enabling it to survive in drought conditions. Its flowers, which can be red, pink, or yellow, bloom during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Adenium speciosum is also notable for its toxic sap, which contains cardiac glycosides and is used in traditional medicine and as a poison in some cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenium speciosum has elliptical or ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is thick, fleshy, and has a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels off in flaky layers. Its flowers are large, showy, and consist of three pink or red petals and three yellow sepals, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are adapted for water storage and are often shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium speciosum is primarily native to parts of Africa, including countries such as Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is also found in the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in Yemen and Oman. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing along dry riverbeds and rocky outcrops. It is commonly known as the "cape tulip" or "desert rose" due to its striking appearance.</p>
<p>Adenium speciosum is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in savannah and woodland habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium speciosum was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking appearance. However, it can be invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
