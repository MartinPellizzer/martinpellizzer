                    <h1>Adenium speciosum</h1>
<p>Adenium speciosum, commonly known as the desert candle, is a striking plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its thick, fleshy trunk and vividly colored flowers. The plant's unique morphology includes a swollen base that stores water, enabling it to survive in drought conditions. Its flowers, which can be red, pink, or yellow, bloom during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Adenium speciosum is also notable for its toxic sap, which contains cardiac glycosides and is used in traditional medicine and as a poison in some cultures.</p>
