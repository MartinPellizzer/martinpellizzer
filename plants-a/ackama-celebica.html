<p>Ackama celebica, commonly known as the Celebes ackama, is a flowering plant native to the Moluccas in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, opposite leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in umbels, and are fragrant.</p>
<p>Ackama celebica is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Ackama celebica has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is brownish in color. Its small, clustered flowers are white with a yellow center, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects.

<p>This plant is found in the tropical regions of these areas, where it thrives in moist and humid environments. It is commonly associated with coastal and lowland habitats across its native range. Ackama celebica is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing abilities.</p>
<p>Its distribution highlights its ecological importance in the biodiversity of the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Ackama celebica was mainly introduced to the Philippines as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in various regions, including the Visayas and Mindanao, where it is often found in gardens and private collections. Despite its ornamental value, it has not become invasive in its introduced range, remaining primarily in controlled environments.
