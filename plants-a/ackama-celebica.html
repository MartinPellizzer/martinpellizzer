                <h1>Ackama celebica</h1>
<p>Ackama celebica, commonly known as the Celebes ackama, is a flowering plant native to the Moluccas in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and broad, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Ackama celebica is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has made it a subject of interest in horticulture and botanical studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Ackama celebica has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a pale yellowish-white color, blooming during the dry season and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the surface layer of the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Ackama celebica is a flowering plant native to the Indonesian island of Celebes (Sulawesi).</p>
<p>It is currently found in specific regions of Sulawesi, particularly in the lowland and hill forests. The plant thrives in humid, tropical rainforest environments with high rainfall and warm temperatures. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is considered vulnerable, requiring further research and protection efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Ackama celebica is a unique plant native to the island of Celebes, known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the plant's genetic traits. The growth cycle of Ackama celebica includes a dormant phase during winter, followed by active growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, especially during its growing season. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer every few months and regular pruning to shape the plant and encourage new growth are essential for its health. Common pests include aphids and mealybugs, while diseases such as root rot can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Ackama celebica is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for its reproduction and the health of the ecosystem. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants. Its dense foliage also helps in preventing soil erosion, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Overall, Ackama celebica plays a vital ecological role in maintaining biodiversity and soil fertility.</p>
