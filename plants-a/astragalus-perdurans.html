                    <h1>Astragalus perdurans</h1>
<p>Astragalus perdurans, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and sagebrush habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and extreme temperatures makes it an important component of desert flora.</p>
