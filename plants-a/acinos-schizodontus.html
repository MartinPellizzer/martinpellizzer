                <h1>Acinos schizodontus</h1>
<p>Acinos schizodontus, commonly known as the Alpine goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones.</p>
<p>Acinos schizodontus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its high-altitude environment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos schizodontus has leaves that are narrowly elliptic to oblanceolate in shape, with a silver-gray coloration due to dense pubescence, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 1â€“3 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat branched, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are minute and numerous.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and dry environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos schizodontus is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and foothills, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is often associated with open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It is particularly adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Acinos schizodontus plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos schizodontus was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers and drought tolerance. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its prolific seed production.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
