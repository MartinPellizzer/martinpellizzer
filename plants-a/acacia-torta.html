                        <h1>Acacia torta</h1>
<p>Acacia torta, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twisted branches and feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and often has a silvery sheen, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Acacia torta is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia torta is primarily native to the western United States, including parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is also found in northern Mexico, particularly in the states of Chihuahua and Sonora. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry slopes. It is commonly associated with desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acacia torta is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia torta was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility. Its rapid growth and hardiness make it a popular choice for landscaping and windbreaks.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly.</p>
