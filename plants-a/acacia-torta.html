                <h1>Acacia torta</h1>
<p>Acacia torta, commonly known as the curl-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like, bipinnate leaves that curl tightly when dry. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences. Its seed pods are elongated and woody, containing several flat, rectangular seeds.</p>
<p>Acacia torta is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia torta has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, feathery leaflets arranged in pairs along central stems, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green, with a slightly glossy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stems. The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are yellow and arranged in globular heads, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a woody pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia torta is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Baja California. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrublands. Acacia torta typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>It is listed as a species of concern in some regions due to habitat loss and overgrazing, though it is not currently classified as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia torta is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to the western United States, known for its striking yellow flowers and twisted branches.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization is minimal, and pruning should be done in early spring to maintain shape and encourage flowering. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or sedum can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal in a garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia torta is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for a variety of wildlife, including birds, insects, and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers and nectar. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants. Its dense root system also helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape in arid environments.</p>
<p>Overall, Acacia torta plays a vital ecological role in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acacia torta is a versatile plant with a wide range of uses and applications.</p>
