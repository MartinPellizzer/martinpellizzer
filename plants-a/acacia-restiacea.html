                    <h1>Acacia restiacea</h1>
<p>Acacia restiacea, commonly known as the slender acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to spines. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting a variety of pollinators. Acacia restiacea is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
