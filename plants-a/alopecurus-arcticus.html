                    <h1>Alopecurus arcticus</h1>
<p>Alopecurus arcticus, commonly known as Arctic mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It has fine, silky hairs covering its leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Alopecurus arcticus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for herbivorous animals in its harsh environment.</p>
