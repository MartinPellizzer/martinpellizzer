<p>Acacia arabica var. adstringens, commonly known as the Egyptian acacia, is a shrub native to the Arabian Peninsula and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its straight, slender branches and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces flat, leaf-like phyllodes that are often mistaken for leaves, and it has a deep root system adapted to arid environments. Its bark and leaves contain tannins, making it valuable in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its role in the production of gum arabic, a substance used in food, pharmaceuticals, and industry.</p>
