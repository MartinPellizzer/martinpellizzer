<p>Asclepias crassicoronata, commonly known as the thick-capped milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and large, showy flowers with a distinctive crown-like structure. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many herbivores. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by butterflies, particularly the monarch and queen species.</p>
<p>Asclepias crassicoronata plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems and serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly.</p>
