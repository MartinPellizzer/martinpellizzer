                <h1>Adelobotrys marginatus</h1>
<p>Adelobotrys marginatus, commonly known as the margined adelobotrys, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warmer climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys marginatus has leaves that are simple, ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white to pale pink petals, and they bloom from late spring to early summer, relying on insect pollination, primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in nutrient absorption and anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys marginatus is primarily native to Brazil North, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical regions of these countries. It thrives in humid and warm environments, often growing in lowland areas. Its natural habitat includes forests and disturbed lands where it can receive ample sunlight.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to the diverse ecological conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys marginatus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Oregon in the early 2000s. The plant has since spread to parts of Washington and northern California. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora.</p>
