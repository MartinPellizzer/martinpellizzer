<p>Acetosella grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Geraniaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in cooler weather. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are typically arranged in a terminal cyme. Acetosella grandifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes, and it is native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid.</p>
