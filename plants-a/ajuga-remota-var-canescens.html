<p>Ajuga remota var. canescens, commonly known as the gray ajuga, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers in late spring, which are clustered in whorls along the stems. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form a lush carpet of foliage.</p>
