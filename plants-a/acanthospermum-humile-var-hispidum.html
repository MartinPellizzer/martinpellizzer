                        <h1>Acanthospermum humile var. hispidum</h1>
<p>Acanthospermum humile var. hispidum, commonly known as the hairy sand verbena, is a low-growing annual herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features narrow, hairy leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in clusters, which bloom from summer to fall. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its hairy texture and compact growth make it well-adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthospermum humile var. hispidum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savanna and woodland habitats, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This plant is also present in parts of southern and eastern Africa, including Mozambique and South Africa. It thrives in areas with moderate to high rainfall and is adapted to a wide range of soil types.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes introduced to other regions as a weed or for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthospermum humile var. hispidum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fluffy seed heads.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several southern states, particularly in Texas and Florida. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides and in vacant lots. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential weed in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major invasive species in most areas where it is established.</p>
