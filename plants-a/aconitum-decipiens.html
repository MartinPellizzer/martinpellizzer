                <h1>Aconitum decipiens</h1>
<p>Aconitum decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs.</p>
<p>Aconitum decipiens contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and a plant that should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum decipiens has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a coarse texture and serrated edges.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem, and bloom in late summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum decipiens is primarily native to Altay, Mongolia, and Tuva.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, where it thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is commonly associated with rocky soils and high-altitude environments. The species is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific regions in Central Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum decipiens was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites and can spread rapidly in these environments. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
<p>Its presence can negatively impact native plant communities and ecosystem balance.</p>
