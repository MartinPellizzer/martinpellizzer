                    <h1>Aegilops cylindrica var. flavescens</h1>
<p>Aegilops cylindrica var. flavescens, commonly known as the wild rye or jointed wild rye, is a grass species native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along roadsides. It produces awned lemmas and is wind-pollinated, which is a common reproductive strategy among grasses.</p>
<p>This species is also of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
