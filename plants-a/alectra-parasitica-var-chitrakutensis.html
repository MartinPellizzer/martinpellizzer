                    <h1>Alectra parasitica var. chitrakutensis</h1>
<p>Alectra parasitica var. chitrakutensis, commonly known as the Chitrakut ghost flower, is a parasitic plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant typically grows on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants, forming a symbiotic relationship. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are often overlooked due to their diminutive size.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its unique ecological role in certain forest ecosystems.</p>
