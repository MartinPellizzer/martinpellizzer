It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Acacia stuhlmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia stuhlmannii is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands, grasslands, and along roadsides. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with sclerophyllous vegetation. It is particularly common in the inland regions of Queensland and the southern parts of New South Wales.</p>
<p>Acacia stuhlmannii is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia stuhlmannii was mainly introduced to areas with dry to semi-arid climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in open landscapes and is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and disturbed sites. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has led to its spread in several parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
