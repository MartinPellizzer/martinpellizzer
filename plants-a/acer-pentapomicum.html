                    <h1>Acer pentapomicum</h1>
<p>Acer pentapomicum, commonly known as the five-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically five- to seven-lobed and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras (winged seeds) that aid in its dispersal. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it prefers well-drained soils in temperate climates.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
