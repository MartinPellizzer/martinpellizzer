<p>Ampelopsis brevipedunculata var. ciliata, commonly known as the curlyleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, lobed leaves with hairy margins that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, wooded areas.</p>
<p>Its vigorous growth makes it both a valuable ornamental plant and an invasive species in some regions.</p>
