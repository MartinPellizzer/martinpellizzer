                <h1>Adenocalymma asperulum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma asperulum, commonly known as the rough-leaved adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are rough and hairy, providing a distinctive texture, while its flowers are usually pink or white.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma asperulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma asperulum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough, hairy texture and a dark green color on the upper surface, and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, often branching from the base, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring to early summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma asperulum is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the subtropical and tropical climates of these areas. This plant typically grows in grasslands, savannas, and along the edges of forests. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats with moderate sunlight.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely associated with the Cerrado and Chaco biomes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma asperulum was mainly introduced to Australia as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southeastern regions of the country, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and suburban gardens. However, it has also been reported to naturalize in some areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to increased monitoring to assess its ecological effects.</p>
