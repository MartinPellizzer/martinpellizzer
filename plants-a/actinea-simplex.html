                <h1>Actinea simplex</h1>
<p>Actinea simplex, commonly known as the common sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. Actinea simplex thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along rocky shores.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea simplex has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly glossy surface, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length and varying in color from light green to dark green depending on the season.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale pink, consisting of five petals and five sepals, and bloom in early spring, relying on wind pollination for reproduction. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea simplex is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments where it can receive indirect sunlight. This plant is commonly found in areas with rich, organic soil and a humid climate. It is often associated with old-growth forests and is considered a rare species in its native range.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Actinea simplex is also listed as a threatened species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea simplex was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fern-like foliage. The distribution has expanded beyond its original range due to its adaptability to various soil types and climates. It is now found in moist, shaded areas throughout the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
