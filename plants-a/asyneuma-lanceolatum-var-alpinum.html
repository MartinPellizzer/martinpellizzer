                    <h1>Asyneuma lanceolatum var. alpinum</h1>
<p>Asyneuma lanceolatum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine goldenweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its ecological niche as a resilient plant of mountainous regions.</p>
