<p>Adiantum cuneatum var. veneris, commonly known as the Venus's Tears, is a fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in a distinctive pattern. It prefers well-draining, moist soil and indirect sunlight, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its elegant foliage, which adds a refined touch to both indoor and outdoor landscapes.</p>
