                <h1>Acidocroton adelioides</h1>
<p>Acidocroton adelioides, commonly known as the Adelioides croton, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often toxic species. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidocroton adelioides has compound, pinnate leaves that are typically elliptical or lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, ridged texture and a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, flaky layers. It produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with four petals, blooming during the dry season, and is pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton adelioides is primarily native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the island, particularly in forested areas. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often seen in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Its natural distribution is limited to specific habitats within Cuba.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton adelioides was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded understory conditions. This plant is valued for its ornamental leaves, which display vibrant green and yellow hues. It has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>However, its introduction to new environments has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts.</p>
