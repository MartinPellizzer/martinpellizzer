<p>Acidocroton adelioides, commonly known as the Adelioides Croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidocroton adelioides has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>
