                    <h1>Anastraphia calcicola</h1>
<p>Anastraphia calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola starflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Anastraphia calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations.</p>
