                    <h1>Angraecum plehnianum</h1>
<p>Angraecum plehnianum, commonly known as the Plehn's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features long, slender pseudobulbs and produces pendulous, white to pale green flowers with prominent, elongated sepals and petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its blooming period typically occurs during the dry season, and it is noted for its unique floral structure that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
