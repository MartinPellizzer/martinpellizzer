                <h1>Achyrocline hirta</h1>
<p>Achyrocline hirta, commonly known as the hairy achyrocline, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline environments, making it a halophyte. Its hairy leaves and small yellow flowers are features that help it retain moisture and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is often found in sandy soils and is considered an important species for coastal vegetation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline hirta has simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, winged seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline hirta is primarily native to Colombia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean regions of the country. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is often associated with dry to moist forest environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Colombia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline hirta was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as landscaping and gardening.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed areas like roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded environments. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent negative impacts on native plant communities.</p>
