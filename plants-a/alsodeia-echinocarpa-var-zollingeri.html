<p>Alsodeia echinocarpa var. zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's spinyweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent habit and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish to orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptations to drought include a deep root system and the ability to store water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its resilience in harsh environments.</p>
