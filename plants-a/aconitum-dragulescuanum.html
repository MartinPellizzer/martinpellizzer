                <h1>Aconitum dragulescuanum</h1>
<p>Aconitum dragulescuanum, commonly known as the Dragulescu aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Romania.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense spikes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Like other aconites, it contains potent alkaloids and is highly toxic to both humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum dragulescuanum has leaves that are compound, with a palmate shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and they are typically a deep green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and cylindrical, with a smooth, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a straight, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are showy, consisting of two lips and five sepals, with a deep blue to purple color, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storing nutrients and water in its native habitat.</p>
