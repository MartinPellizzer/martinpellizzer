                <h1>Acrolasia micrantha</h1>
<p>Acrolasia micrantha, commonly known as the small-fruited acrolasia, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves with a smooth texture. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Acrolasia micrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolasia micrantha has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth texture, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a light brown, smooth bark that grows in a straight, upright pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green in color, consisting of four petals and stamens, blooming during the late spring to early summer and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia micrantha is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acrolasia micrantha is also occasionally found in parts of the Indian subcontinent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia micrantha was mainly introduced to new habitats due to its adaptability and potential ornamental value.</p>
<p>It has been observed in disturbed areas such as roadsides, wastelands, and agricultural fields. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions contribute to its spread. It is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
<p>Proper management strategies are needed to control its distribution and minimize ecological impact.</p>
