                <h1>Acer pensylvanicum</h1>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow during autumn. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree typically grows to a height of 10–25 meters.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum has leaves that are broadly ovate to round, with a doubly serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5–10 cm in diameter, turning vibrant red in the fall.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring, with wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a paired, winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small with a single wing for flight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, primarily found in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as New England, New York, Pennsylvania, and parts of Ontario. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mixed forests, often growing in shaded or partially shaded environments. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from lowlands to around 900 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acer pensylvanicum is considered a species of concern in some regions, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum is a native deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ecological value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves rapid initial growth followed by a slower maturation phase, typically reaching maturity in 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture and requires regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization is minimal, and pruning should focus on shaping and removing diseased branches.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may face issues with scale insects or leaf spot, and it pairs well with native grasses and wildflowers in companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum is a native deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and promoting plant diversity. Its dense canopy offers protection to smaller plants and animals, contributing to habitat complexity.</p>
<p>Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent erosion, stabilizing soil in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum is a small, deciduous tree native to eastern North America, known for its distinctive red flowers and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its sap can be processed into syrup, though it is less common than maple syrup. In traditional medicine, it has been used by Indigenous peoples for its potential anti-inflammatory and astringent properties. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and serves as a habitat for various wildlife species, supporting local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and is often featured in local conservation efforts and botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Sanguine,' known for their striking red foliage. Hybrids with other maples, such as *Acer x antoineii*, have been developed to enhance fall color and hardiness. These cultivars and hybrids are important in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>
<p>Their use in landscaping highlights the plant's significance in both ecological and ornamental contexts.</p>
