                <h1>Acer pensylvanicum</h1>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum, commonly known as the striped maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive bark, which features vertical stripes. The leaves are opposite, palmately lobed, and turn vibrant shades of yellow in the fall. It prefers moist, acidic soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a pointed tip and serrated edges.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The stem is slender and erect, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help stabilize the plant in its woodland habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, primarily found in the Appalachian Mountains and parts of the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions from New York to Florida and westward to Texas, though it is most common in the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, acidic soils in forested areas, often growing in shade-tolerant conditions under canopy cover. This species typically grows at elevations between 200 and 1,500 meters, preferring cool, humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer pensylvanicum is considered a species of concern in some areas, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pensylvanicum is a deciduous shrub known for its vibrant red fall foliage and ecological value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for germination. This plant has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, acidic soil and moderate watering, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization is generally unnecessary, and minimal pruning is needed to maintain its natural form.</p>
<p>It is relatively pest and disease resistant, making it a low-maintenance choice, and is often planted with ferns or azaleas to enhance garden aesthetics and biodiversity.</p>
