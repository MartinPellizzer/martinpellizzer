<p>Ajuga chamaecistus subsp.</p>
<p>bamianica, commonly known as the Bamian Ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form thick, weed-suppressing ground cover.</p>
