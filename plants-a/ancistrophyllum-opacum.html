                    <h1>Ancistrophyllum opacum</h1>
<p>Ancistrophyllum opacum, commonly known as the opacum sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs, which reduce water loss and reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>Ancistrophyllum opacum is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
