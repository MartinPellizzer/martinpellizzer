<p>Asplenium sepulchrale, commonly known as the墓地蕨 or graveyard fern, is a species of polypody fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often clustered at the base, forming a dense, low-growing rosette. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are surrounded by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Asplenium sepulchrale is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
