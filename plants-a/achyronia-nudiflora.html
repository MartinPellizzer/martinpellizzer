                <h1>Achyronia nudiflora</h1>
<p>Achyronia nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flowered achyronia, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered near the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia nudiflora has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green color, ranging from 3 to 8 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia nudiflora is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, including swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with pine flatwood and cypress domes ecosystems. It plays an important role in the local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a characteristic species of the region's wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia nudiflora was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states like California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is commonly found in desert and semi-arid regions. The plant is known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water. It has become a common sight in areas where it has been introduced, often growing along roadsides and in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has spread beyond its original range, raising concerns about its impact on native flora.</p>
