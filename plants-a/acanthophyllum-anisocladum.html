                        <h1>Acanthophyllum anisocladum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum anisocladum, commonly known as the spiny saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
