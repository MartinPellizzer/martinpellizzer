<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>oliverianum, commonly known as the Oliver's maple, is a rare and ornamental tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It prefers cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and ornamental value, it is often sought after by horticulturists and conservationists.</p>
