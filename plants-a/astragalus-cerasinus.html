                    <h1>Astragalus cerasinus</h1>
<p>Astragalus cerasinus, commonly known as red milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Astragalus cerasinus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
