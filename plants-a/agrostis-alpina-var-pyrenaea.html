                    <h1>Agrostis alpina var. pyrenaea</h1>
<p>Agrostis alpina var. pyrenaea, commonly known as alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in harsh environments.</p>
