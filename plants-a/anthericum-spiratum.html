                    <h1>Anthericum spiratum</h1>
<p>Anthericum spiratum, commonly known as the spiral arum, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive spiral arrangement of its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces a spadix, a dense cluster of tiny flowers surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Anthericum spiratum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique floral structure.</p>
