<p>Androcorys pugioniformis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the underground stem producing both roots and new shoots. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments.</p>
<p>The fern thrives in shaded, moist areas and is often found in rainforests and along stream banks.</p>
