                    <h1>Acacia colei var. ileocarpa</h1>
<p>Acacia colei var. ileocarpa, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread along coastal dunes.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
