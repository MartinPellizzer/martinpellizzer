                        <h1>Acacia colei var. ileocarpa</h1>
<p>Acacia colei var. ileocarpa, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.
