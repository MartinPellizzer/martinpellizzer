                <h1>Acosta lactiflora</h1>
<p>Acosta lactiflora, commonly known as the milkflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acosta lactiflora is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta lactiflora has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, typically displaying a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a light green to brownish hue, with a climbing growth pattern that allows it to ascend supports. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta lactiflora is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, often in areas with cooler climates. This plant thrives in mountainous environments where the soil is well-drained and the climate is temperate. It is often associated with rocky or sandy soils in the Andes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta lactiflora was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands and open woodlands where it thrives in full sun. The plant is known for its showy white flowers that bloom in the spring, making it a popular ornamental species. It has been introduced to several countries outside its native range for horticultural purposes.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
