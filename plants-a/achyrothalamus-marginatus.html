                <h1>Achyrothalamus marginatus</h1>
<p>Achyrothalamus marginatus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is also valued for its durable, aromatic wood.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrothalamus marginatus has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated leaflets that are usually oval or lance-shaped, varying in size from 2 to 5 cm in length, and have a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrothalamus marginatus is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of tropical regions in Asia and the Pacific, though it is now primarily found in cultivated areas rather than the wild. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with high rainfall and warm temperatures. This species typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to about 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyrothalamus marginatus is a unique and hardy plant commonly grown for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of a balanced fertilizer during the growing season, while pruning is generally only needed to remove dead or damaged foliage. It is relatively resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally suffer from root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species can enhance its growth in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achyrothalamus marginatus is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its fruits for sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through mutualistic relationships. Additionally, its dense growth habit helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>It also plays a role in supporting biodiversity by creating microhabitats that shelter insects and other small organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achyrothalamus marginatus is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it plays a role in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The plant also contributes to local economies through horticultural trade and biodiversity conservation efforts. Culturally, it holds symbolic meaning in some regions, often associated with resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting pollinators and maintaining forest ecosystems underscores its importance in environmental sustainability.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achyrothalamus marginatus has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegatus' and 'Marginatus,' which are known for their striking leaf patterns and vibrant colors. Hybrids of this plant are often developed to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and flowering intensity. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>They are widely cultivated for their unique foliage and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions.</p>
