                <h1>Achyrothalamus marginatus</h1>
<p>Achyrothalamus marginatus, commonly known as the mountain holly or mountain privet, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, and it is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrothalamus marginatus has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, clustered, and have a white to pale yellow color, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrothalamus marginatus is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California, Oregon, and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as chaparral and coastal sage scrub. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often associated with coastal and inland mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of Baja California, Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrothalamus marginatus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activities such as land clearing and construction.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and well-drained soil. The plant is commonly found in disturbed urban and suburban landscapes, including roadsides and abandoned lots. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize bare ground make it an aggressive invader in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has spread to various parts of the world beyond its native range.</p>
