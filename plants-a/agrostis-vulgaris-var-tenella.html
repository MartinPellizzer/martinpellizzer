                    <h1>Agrostis vulgaris var. tenella</h1>
<p>Agrostis vulgaris var. tenella, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny grains. It is well adapted to wet conditions and can thrive in areas with poor drainage.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
