                <h1>Abutilon usambarense</h1>
<p>Abutilon usambarense, commonly known as the velvetleaf or African velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to Africa, the Caribbean, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, lantern-shaped yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon usambarense has alternate, ovate to heart-shaped leaves that are usually hairy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures, and it grows upright with a bushy habit. The flowers are pendulous, with five petals that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in summer and attracting insects for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a shallow network, allowing the plant to anchor itself and absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
