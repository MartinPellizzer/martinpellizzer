                    <h1>Arenaria subcongesta</h1>
<p>Arenaria subcongesta, commonly known as the coastal sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dune environments where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, helping it conserve water in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria subcongesta plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
