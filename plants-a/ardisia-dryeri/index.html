                            <h1>Ardisia Dryeri</h1>
<p>Ardisia dryeri is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is known for its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, bright red berries that appear in late summer. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate salt spray. Ardisia dryeri is not only aesthetically pleasing but also supports local wildlife, contributing to the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
