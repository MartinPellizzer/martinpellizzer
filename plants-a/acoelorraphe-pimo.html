                <h1>Acoelorraphe pimo</h1>
<p>Acoelorraphe pimo, commonly known as the Pimo lily, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Acoelorraphe pimo is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential use in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoelorraphe pimo has leaves that are simple, ovate, and slightly serrated, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoelorraphe pimo is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland wetlands. It is an important component of the native flora in these regions, contributing to the ecological balance of the wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not commonly found outside of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoelorraphe pimo was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as landscaping and gardening.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, making it a potential invasive species in some regions. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its competitive nature and potential impact on native flora.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities, leading to its cultivation in various parts of the world.</p>
