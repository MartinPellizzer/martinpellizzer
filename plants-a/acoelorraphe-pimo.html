                <h1>Acoelorraphe pimo</h1>
<p>Acoelorraphe pimo, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the Atlantic coast. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>Acoelorraphe pimo is adapted to harsh coastal environments, with mechanisms to withstand salt spray and strong winds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoelorraphe pimo has leaves that are elongated, lanceolate in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, displaying a bright green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a pale green to reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are pale yellow, consisting of four petals and four sepals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, spreading just below the soil surface to absorb moisture and nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoelorraphe pimo is a flowering plant native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations, primarily in coastal and inland areas. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is typically found in coastal scrub and chaparral environments. This species grows at elevations ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Acoelorraphe pimo is classified as a threatened species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acoelorraphe pimo is a hardy, fast-growing plant known for its lush foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the desired traits. The growth cycle of Acoelorraphe pimo is relatively short, with rapid development during the growing season and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and occasional pruning to shape the plant and promote growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acoelorraphe pimo is a native plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its deep roots help with erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acoelorraphe pimo contributes to nutrient cycling in the soil, improving overall soil fertility.</p>
