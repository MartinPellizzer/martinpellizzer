<p>It features small, fleshy leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it an important component of stabilizing fragile ecosystems.</p>
