                <h1>Adiantum reptans</h1>
<p>Adiantum reptans, commonly known as the walking fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that curl upward, giving it a unique, almost prehensile appearance. The plant is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes grow along the ground, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Adiantum reptans is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum reptans has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and are typically arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green, with a smooth texture and can grow up to 15 cm in length. The stem is slender and creeping, with a light green color and a smooth, hairless surface. Adiantum reptans does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-bearing plant.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum reptans is primarily native to Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It is often seen growing on rocks or in crevices in the undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its native range in Costa Rica reflects its adaptability to humid, tropical climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum reptans was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This fern is often cultivated for its delicate, lace-like fronds and ability to thrive in humid environments. It has been reported as an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among local ecologists regarding its impact on native plant communities.</p>
