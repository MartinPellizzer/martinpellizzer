<p>Apera spica-venti, commonly known as windgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open areas such as roadsides, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences, which are often adorned with fine, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is known for its ability to colonize and stabilize soil.</p>
