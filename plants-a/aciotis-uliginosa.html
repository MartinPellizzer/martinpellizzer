                <h1>Aciotis uliginosa</h1>
<p>Aciotis uliginosa, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found along the edges of ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Aciotis uliginosa plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis uliginosa has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>Its stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clumping pattern. The flowers are small, yellow, and tubular, arranged in loose clusters, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant thrive in wet, marshy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis uliginosa is primarily native to wetland areas of Central and South America, including parts of Mexico, Central America, and the northern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, often boggy habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This plant is commonly found in regions with high humidity and saturated soils, which support its growth. Its distribution is closely tied to the availability of waterlogged environments.</p>
<p>It is particularly common in the Neotropical region, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis uliginosa was mainly introduced to wetland and marshy areas where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high groundwater levels and is often associated with peat bogs and fens. This plant has been reported in several European countries, particularly in the UK and Ireland, where it has established itself in natural and semi-natural habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora in these sensitive ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
