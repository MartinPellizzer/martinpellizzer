                <h1>Aciotis uliginosa</h1>
<p>Aciotis uliginosa, commonly known as swamp coreopsis, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis uliginosa has leaves that are narrowly elliptic to lanceolate, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody at the base, with a rough, grayish-brown bark and a growth pattern that is typically clump-forming. The flowers are small, clustered in dense terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in wet, boggy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis uliginosa is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and marshes of South America, particularly in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of North America, especially in the southeastern United States, where it has been introduced and naturalized. This species thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is commonly found in swampy areas, along stream banks, and in flooded meadows. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 300 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Aciotis uliginosa is considered a vulnerable species in some regions, though its conservation status can vary by locality.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aciotis uliginosa is a wetland plant commonly found in marshy areas and along water bodies, known for its ability to thrive in moist environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing established clumps, with the best results achieved in early spring or fall. The growth cycle of Aciotis uliginosa is typically annual, with rapid growth during the warmer months followed by flowering and seed production in late summer.</p>
<p>It prefers rich, organic soil that remains consistently moist, requiring regular watering to maintain optimal conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring can promote healthy growth, while pruning dead foliage in late autumn helps maintain plant health.</p>
<p>Common pests include aphids and snails, while fungal diseases can occur in poorly drained soil, making companion planting with moisture-loving species like cattails beneficial.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aciotis uliginosa is a wetland plant that provides essential food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in wetland restoration projects, enhancing soil stability and supporting other native vegetation. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Aciotis uliginosa contributes to nutrient cycling in wetland ecosystems, supporting overall ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Aciotis uliginosa is a flowering plant commonly found in wetland environments, known for its ability to thrive in moist and often nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It has limited culinary use due to its bitter taste and unpalatable nature, but it plays a significant role in ecological systems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms. In traditional medicine, it has been used by some indigenous communities for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators, which indirectly benefits agricultural systems.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and adaptability, often serving as an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Aciotis uliginosa has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Alba' and 'Variegata', which are known for their striking white and variegated foliage. Hybrids of Aciotis uliginosa are often developed to enhance disease resistance and adaptability to different growing conditions. These plants hold horticultural importance as they are used in shade gardens and as decorative elements in landscape design.</p>
<p>Their unique appearance makes them a sought-after addition to botanical collections and specialty gardens.</p>
