<p>Adiantopsis minutula, commonly known as the minute maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of the common maidenhair fern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually less than an inch in length, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantopsis minutula is a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of conservation interest.</p>
