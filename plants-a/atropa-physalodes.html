                    <h1>Atropa physalodes</h1>
<p>Atropa physalodes, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like plant that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with dark green, ovate leaves and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant produces berries that start green and turn red or orange when ripe, which are highly toxic due to the presence of tropane alkaloids. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its historical use in medicine and as a poison has made it both fascinating and dangerous.</p>
