                    <h1>Acacia semirigida</h1>
<p>Acacia semirigida, commonly known as the rigid acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless branches and phyllodes that are narrow and rigid, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a common adaptation in acacia species to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acacia semirigida is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in reforestation and erosion control.</p>
