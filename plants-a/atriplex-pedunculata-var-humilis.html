                    <h1>Atriplex pedunculata var. humilis</h1>
<p>Atriplex pedunculata var. humilis, commonly known as silverleaf shadscale, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, reflective hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to store water, while its stems are often woody and branched.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities.</p>
