                    <h1>Alectorolophus alpinus var. erectus</h1>
<p>Alectorolophus alpinus var. erectus, commonly known as the Alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and surrounding mountain ranges.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that form dense, tufted clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens and conservation areas.</p>
