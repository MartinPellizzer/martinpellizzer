                <h1>Acrostichum punctulatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum punctulatum, commonly known as the dotted fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered with small, rounded spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its fronds are typically green with a velvety texture and exhibit a distinctive pattern of dots or speckles.</p>
<p>Acrostichum punctulatum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum punctulatum has large, feather-like leaves that are elongated, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can reach up to 3 meters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows in a clump-forming pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically greenish-yellow in color, which bloom in the spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a round, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it spread and establish in wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum punctulatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of rivers and lakes where there is abundant moisture. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with disturbed or riparian habitats. Its distribution extends from Mexico through the Caribbean islands to parts of northern South America.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in Florida and the southern United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum punctulatum was mainly introduced to the wetlands and disturbed areas of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found along riverbanks and in coastal regions. This plant has been reported in several states including Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. Its introduction is largely due to human activities such as land development and the spread of invasive species.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive plant in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
