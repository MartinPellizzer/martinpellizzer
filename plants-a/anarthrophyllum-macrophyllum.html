<p>It is characterized by its large, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist environments, making it a common sight in marshy areas.</p>
