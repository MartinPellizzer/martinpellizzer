                <h1>Acinodendron majale</h1>
<p>Acinodendron majale, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which is why it is sometimes referred to as the "milk tree.".</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron majale has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron majale is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the dense understory of these forests. The plant is commonly found in regions with high rainfall and well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron majale was mainly introduced to new habitats in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and growth habits. The plant has since spread into natural ecosystems, posing a threat to native plant species. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now focused on controlling its spread and protecting local biodiversity.</p>
