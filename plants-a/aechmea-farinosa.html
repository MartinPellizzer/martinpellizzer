<p>Aechmea farinosa, commonly known as the velvet plant or pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, silver-green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Aechmea farinosa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea farinosa has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, strap-like, and covered with a white powdery coating, arranged in a compact spiral at the base.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant has a short, thick stem that is often hidden beneath the leaves, with a smooth, pale green bark. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that bloom in the summer, relying on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that disperses seeds through wind, and the plant has fibrous roots that anchor it in the soil.</p>
