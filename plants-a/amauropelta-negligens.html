<p>Amauropelta negligens, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates in its aquatic habitat.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
