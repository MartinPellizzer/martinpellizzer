                    <h1>Agrostis parvula</h1>
<p>Agrostis parvula, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a small perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. The plant has fine, tufted leaves and produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Agrostis parvula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
