                <h1>Actinea commutata</h1>
<p>Actinea commutata, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Actinea commutata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea commutata has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and grows upright, with a smooth, light green bark that remains thin throughout its life. It produces small, clustered flowers with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its root system consists of fibrous roots that anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea commutata is primarily native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It can be found in the United States, particularly in the Appalachian region. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It is commonly associated with hardwood forests and is often found in the understory.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution includes states like Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea commutata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. The plant's adaptability to various soil types and climates has contributed to its spread. It often thrives in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and gardens.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
