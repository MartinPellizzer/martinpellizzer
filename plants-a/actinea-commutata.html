                <h1>Actinea commutata</h1>
<p>Actinea commutata, commonly known as the yellow starwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, yellowish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Actinea commutata is typically found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea commutata has leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in umbels, usually white or pale green in color, and bloom in early spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea commutata is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has expanded to include parts of Oceania and the Pacific Islands, often as a result of human introduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats. Actinea commutata is typically found at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>The species is currently listed as least concern by the IUCN Red List, indicating that it is not facing immediate threats to its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinea commutata is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Asia, known for its unique appearance and ecological significance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the rhizomes, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Actinea commutata involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in early summer and dormancy during the colder months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, moist soil and requires consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring is recommended, along with light pruning after flowering to encourage new growth. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while fungal diseases can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving plants like ferns or hostas can enhance its growth in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinea commutata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. Additionally, its extensive root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Overall, Actinea commutata plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity and maintaining ecosystem health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Actinea commutata is a species of sea anemone known for its ecological role in marine environments, where it contributes to biodiversity and serves as a food source for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary contexts, it has been studied for its potential medicinal properties, including antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects. In industrial applications, it is not directly used but plays a role in marine ecosystems that support fisheries and aquaculture. Culturally, it is not widely symbolized in human traditions, though it is appreciated in marine biology for its unique adaptations.</p>
<p>Its study also aids in understanding oceanic health and climate change impacts on marine life.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Actinea commutata has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegata' and 'Albiflora', which are prized for their striking foliage and unique floral displays. Hybrids of Actinea commutata have been developed to enhance traits such as color, size, and hardiness, making them more adaptable to different climates. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in garden settings.</p>
<p>Their cultivation contributes to the diversity and beauty of ornamental plant collections worldwide.</p>
