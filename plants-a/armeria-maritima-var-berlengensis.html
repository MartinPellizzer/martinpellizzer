                    <h1>Armeria maritima var. berlengensis</h1>
<p>Armeria maritima var. berlengensis, commonly known as the Berlingen sandspurry, is a coastal plant native to the western Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with dense, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along coastal cliffs.</p>
<p>Its salt tolerance makes it well adapted to maritime climates and harsh coastal conditions.</p>
