<p>Acer pectinatum var. caudatilobum, commonly known as the weeping maple, is a deciduous tree characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that create a drooping appearance.</p>
<p>It features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are typically bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by winged samaras as its seeds. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its unique form and seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum var. caudatilobum has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a distinctive elongated shape and a vibrant red to orange hue in autumn; they are alternate in arrangement and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, with two winged seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum var. caudatilobum is a rare plant native to the eastern Himalayas, specifically found in regions of Nepal, India, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it is now also cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation collections worldwide. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments within mountain forests, often growing at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered endangered, with conservation efforts focused on protecting its remaining wild populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum var. caudatilobum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and unique, lobed leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. This species has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity within 10-15 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and ecological balance.</p>
