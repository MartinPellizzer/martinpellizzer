<p>Alternanthera lanceolata, commonly known as the red-stemmed alternanthera, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that range from bright green to deep red, depending on light exposure and nutrient levels. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, which are not the primary ornamental feature. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments and is popular in aquariums for its vibrant coloration.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate makes it an effective choice for filling in bare spots in planted tanks.</p>
