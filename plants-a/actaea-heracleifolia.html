                <h1>Actaea heracleifolia</h1>
<p>Actaea heracleifolia, commonly known as the white cohosh, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea heracleifolia has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker and more cracked with age, growing upright and branching towards the top. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a red, berry-like drupe containing several seeds, which are dispersed by birds and other animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and form clumps in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea heracleifolia is primarily native to China North-Central, China South-Central, Inner Mongolia, Korea, Manchuria, and Primorye.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in temperate forested regions and mountainous areas within these regions. It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The species is well adapted to the climatic conditions of its native range, including cool summers and cold winters.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for humid, temperate climates with well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea heracleifolia was mainly introduced to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It was primarily brought there for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique flower structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has been found in forests and along stream banks. It has spread beyond its original introduction sites, raising concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is now monitored in several regions to prevent further spread.</p>
