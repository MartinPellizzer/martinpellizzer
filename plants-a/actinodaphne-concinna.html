<p>Actinodaphne concinna, commonly known as the small-leaf camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkin-like inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. Its bark and leaves contain essential oils, which have been traditionally used in medicinal and aromatic applications.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne concinna is often found in moist, shaded forests and is valued for its ornamental and economic significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne concinna has simple, alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, typically measuring 5â€“12 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that exudes a fragrant resin when damaged. It produces small, fragrant flowers arranged in clusters, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spherical drupe, containing a single seed, which is dispersed by birds attracted to its bright red color.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, aiding in water absorption and stability.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne concinna is primarily native to Malaya.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of this area, particularly in the western part of the Malay Peninsula. The plant thrives in lowland and hill forest environments. It is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with humid and warm climates typical of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne concinna was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and fragrant leaves.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for agricultural purposes. Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range due to horticultural trade and intentional planting.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is introduced.</p>
