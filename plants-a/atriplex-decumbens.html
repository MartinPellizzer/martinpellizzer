<p>Atriplex decumbens, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, typical of the Chenopodiaceae family. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Atriplex decumbens is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and poor nutrient conditions.</p>
