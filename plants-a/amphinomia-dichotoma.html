                    <h1>Amphinomia dichotoma</h1>
<p>Amphinomia dichotoma, commonly known as the twin-stemmed grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, slender stems that often branch at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it conserve water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Amphinomia dichotoma is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
