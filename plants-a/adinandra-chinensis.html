                <h1>Adinandra chinensis</h1>
<p>Adinandra chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange to red berries that contain three seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its timber and traditional medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra chinensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, dark brown bark that peels off in thin strips, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from April to June, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra chinensis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forests. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often growing as a tree or shrub. Its natural range extends into parts of India and Malaysia as well.</p>
<p>Adinandra chinensis is an important component of the forest ecosystems in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra chinensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential ecological benefits.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as China, India, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture and reforestation projects. Its introduction has been both intentional and accidental, depending on the region.</p>
<p>However, its spread requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
