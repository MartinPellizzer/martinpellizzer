                <h1>Adenophora alpina</h1>
<p>Adenophora alpina, commonly known as the alpine adenophora, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features upright stems covered with small, glandular hairs, which give it its scientific name. Its flowers are usually blue or purple, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Adenophora alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora alpina has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and slightly hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, slender, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-gray bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in racemes, and range in color from pale blue to lavender, blooming in late summer to early autumn and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or alpine soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora alpina is primarily native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This plant is commonly found in the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau, where it adapts to cold and harsh climatic conditions. It is particularly prevalent in the northern parts of China, especially in provinces like Sichuan and Qinghai.</p>
<p>Adenophora alpina is well-suited to grow in well-drained soils and is often part of the local flora in these remote, high-altitude ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora alpina was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the United States and Canada, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond its original cultivation areas, becoming naturalized in some regions. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woods. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Adenophora alpina is considered a non-native invasive species in certain areas, though its ecological effects are still being studied.</p>
