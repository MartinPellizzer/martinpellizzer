                    <h1>Asplenium recognitum</h1>
<p>Asplenium recognitum, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a small evergreen fern native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky crevices and shaded areas, thriving in moist, humid conditions. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled or twisted, with a distinctive, compact growth habit. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a single row along the veins.</p>
<p>Asplenium recognitum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate low light conditions.</p>
