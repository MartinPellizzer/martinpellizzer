                <h1>Acroglyphe hispida</h1>
<p>Acroglyphe hispida, commonly known as the hairy acroglyphe, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It is native to certain regions of southern Africa and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroglyphe hispida has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with five petals and a yellowish color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroglyphe hispida is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in environments such as deserts, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Its native range includes states like Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as parts of Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroglyphe hispida was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in urban areas. This plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It spreads through seeds that are dispersed by wind, water, and human activity.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
