                        <h1>Abies alcoquiana</h1>
<p>Abies alcoquiana, commonly known as the Alcoquian fir, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals along the stems. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies alcoquiana is primarily native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes Mountains in South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. This species typically grows in cloud forests and humid montane environments. Its distribution is limited to specific elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local ecosystem and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies alcoquiana was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in higher elevation regions.</p>
<p>It is often found in mountainous areas where it forms dense stands in the understory of coniferous forests. This species is valued for its ornamental characteristics, including its pyramidal shape and attractive blue-green foliage. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for horticultural purposes.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
