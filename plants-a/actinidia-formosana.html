                <h1>Actinidia formosana</h1>
<p>Actinidia formosana, commonly known as the Formosan kiwifruit, is a deciduous vine native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in appearance to common kiwifruit but have a distinct flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and fruit production, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical gardens worldwide.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia formosana has compound, pinnate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, yellowish berry that contains multiple seeds, dispersed by birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and spread horizontally, helping to stabilize the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia formosana is primarily native to eastern China, specifically the regions of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southern Korea and northern Vietnam. This plant thrives in temperate climates with moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in mountainous areas and forest understories.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely associated with the humid subtropical climate zones of East Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia formosana was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for fruit production.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses, where it is cultivated for its aesthetic value. The plant has also been introduced to parts of Europe and Australia, where it is sometimes grown for its edible fruit. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
