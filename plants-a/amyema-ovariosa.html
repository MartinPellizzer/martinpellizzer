                    <h1>Amyema ovariosa</h1>
<p>Amyema ovariosa, commonly known as the ovary lichen, is a unique lichen species that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically crust-like and grows on bark or stone surfaces. The plant's structure is dominated by the fungal component, with the algal partner contributing to photosynthesis. Amyema ovariosa is often found in moist, shaded environments, particularly in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
