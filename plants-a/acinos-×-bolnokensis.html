                <h1>Acinos × bolnokensis</h1>
<p>Acinos × bolnokensis, commonly known as the Bolnokensis acino, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pale pink petals. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this species thrives in dry, rocky soils and full sun exposure. The plant is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos × bolnokensis has compound leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, exhibiting a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color, and it grows in a low, spreading shrub form. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with five petals that are pink to purple in color, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos × bolnokensis is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, specifically found in the Tien Shan and Pamir-Alay ranges.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to these areas, where it grows in alpine and subalpine environments. This species thrives in rocky soils and open slopes, typically at altitudes ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population size, Acinos × bolnokensis is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acinos × bolnokensis is a hybrid plant known for its hardy and ornamental characteristics, often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing existing plants, with seed propagation being the most common method. The growth cycle of Acinos × bolnokensis typically spans from spring to autumn, with flowering occurring in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acinos × bolnokensis is a low-growing perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. This plant acts as a companion plant in mixed vegetation, enhancing the health of surrounding flora. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system, stabilizing soil in rocky or degraded areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports ecological balance by offering habitat and resources throughout different seasons.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acinos × bolnokensis is a hybrid plant native to Central Asia, primarily known for its ornamental value and use in horticulture.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may have limited traditional uses in certain regions. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for ecological restoration projects, contributing to soil stabilization and biodiversity. In cultural contexts, it may hold symbolic significance in local traditions or folklore.</p>
<p>Due to its specific geographic origin, its industrial and economic applications remain largely underexplored.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acinos × bolnokensis has a limited number of recognized varieties, but it is primarily known for its natural hybrid origins between Acinos acanthoides and Acinos alpinus.</p>
<p>Some popular cultivars include 'Alpinus' and 'Acanthoides', which are favored for their compact growth and attractive foliage. Hybrids of this species are often bred for enhanced cold hardiness and improved floral display, making them suitable for alpine gardens. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, Acinos × bolnokensis holds horticultural importance in rock gardens and as a specimen plant in specialized collections.</p>
<p>Its cultivation contributes to the diversity of ornamental plants in challenging growing conditions.</p>
