                        <h1>Acantholimon ecae</h1>
<p>Acantholimon ecae, commonly known as the Eocene's acantholimon, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. Native to the Mediterranean region, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
