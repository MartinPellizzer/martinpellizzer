                <h1>Acinodendron bubalinum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron bubalinum, commonly known as the Bubaline Acino, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Acinodendron bubalinum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and shrublands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron bubalinum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are typically 2-5 cm in length, dark green on top, and lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread widely, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron bubalinum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forests. This plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary growth areas and is sometimes found near water sources.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of the Indian subcontinent as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron bubalinum was mainly introduced to the Southeast Asian region, particularly in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It was primarily introduced for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in some areas, leading to concerns about its impact on native flora. It is often found growing in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open forests.</p>
<p>Despite its introduction, it remains a relatively rare and localized species in the regions where it has been established.</p>
