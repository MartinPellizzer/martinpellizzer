                <h1>Achyrocline eriodes</h1>
<p>Achyrocline eriodes, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Achyrocline eriodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline eriodes has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a rough, hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale greenish-brown color and an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, typically ranging from white to pale blue, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are tiny with a pappus for aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils it inhabits.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline eriodes is primarily native to Brazil Northeast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the northeastern regions of Brazil, particularly in the state of Cear√°. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in open areas and disturbed soils. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is known for its aromatic properties.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the northeastern part of Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline eriodes was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in coastal and sandy environments. This plant is commonly found in the Caribbean, parts of South America, and the Pacific Islands. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded through both natural dispersal and human-assisted spread.</p>
