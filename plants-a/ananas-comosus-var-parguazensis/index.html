                            <h1>Ananas Comosus Var. Parguazensis</h1>
<p>Ananas comosus var. parguazensis is a rare and lesser-known pineapple cultivar native to the Andes mountains of South America. This unique variety is distinguished by its compact size and distinctive, often colorful leaf patterns. Unlike the common pineapple, it is rarely cultivated commercially due to its limited yield and specific growing conditions. Its ornamental value has made it a favorite among plant enthusiasts and collectors. Despite its rarity, it holds cultural and ecological significance in its native regions.</p>
