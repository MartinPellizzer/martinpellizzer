                <h1>Acridocarpus congolensis</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus congolensis, commonly known as the Congo acridocarpus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Anacardiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Central and Southern Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered yellow flowers. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the fruit is a small, three-lobed drupe.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus congolensis has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets that are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark that is reddish-brown and exhibits a fibrous texture. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white or pale yellow petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus congolensis is primarily native to Angola, Cameroon, Congo, and DR Congo.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in tropical rainforest regions within these countries. It thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing in dense undergrowth. The species is well-adapted to the climatic conditions of Central and Southern Africa.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas due to its ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus congolensis was mainly introduced to South Africa as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in gardens and private collections, particularly in regions with warm and humid climates. Despite its ornamental value, it is not commonly found in the wild in South Africa. The plant's introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Further monitoring is needed to assess its impact on native flora and biodiversity.</p>
