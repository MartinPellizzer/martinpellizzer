                <h1>Acer mono var. quelpaertense</h1>
<p>Acer mono var. quelpaertense, commonly known as the Jeju maple, is a deciduous tree native to the island of Jeju in South Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red in the autumn. The plant belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Its unique leaf shape and seasonal color change make it a popular choice for horticultural displays.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer mono var. quelpaertense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the rocky soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer mono var. quelpaertense is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the Korean Peninsula, specifically found in the Jeju Island region of South Korea.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations on Jeju Island, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 800 meters above sea level. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from development and climate change, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer mono var. quelpaertense is a unique maple variety known for its striking red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings offering a more reliable method for maintaining varietal traits. The growth cycle involves rapid spring growth followed by a dormant period in winter, making it adaptable to temperate climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or shrubs enhances its aesthetic appeal in garden settings.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer mono var. quelpaertense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and supporting diverse plant life. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil and prevents runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence supports a range of ecological benefits, making it an important component of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
