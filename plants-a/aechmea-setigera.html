                <h1>Aechmea setigera</h1>
<p>Aechmea setigera, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a fine, powdery bloom that gives them a silvery appearance. Its flowers, which are usually pink or red, emerge from the center of the rosette and are followed by showy inflorescences.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea setigera has rosette-shaped leaves that are sword-like, stiff, and covered with a waxy layer, arranged in a tight spiral around the plant's central axis.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green with a silver or white midrib, and they can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant has a short, thick stem with a smooth, dark brown bark that grows vertically from the base of the rosette. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, with white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that produces small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
