                    <h1>Aechmea setigera</h1>
<p>Aechmea setigera, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a fine, powdery bloom that gives them a silvery appearance. Its flowers, which are usually pink or red, emerge from the center of the rosette and are followed by showy inflorescences.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
