<p>Alchemilla sinuata, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in branched clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Alchemilla sinuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet habitats.</p>
