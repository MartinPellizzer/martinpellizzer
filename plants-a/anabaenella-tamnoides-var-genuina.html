                    <h1>Anabaenella tamnoides var. genuina</h1>
<p>Anabaenella tamnoides var. genuina, commonly known as the freshwater cyanobacterium, is a nitrogen-fixing organism that thrives in nutrient-rich aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its filamentous structure composed of cylindrical cells that form unbranched chains. This species is often found in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving waters, where it contributes to the biological nitrogen cycle. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in oligotrophic ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, under certain conditions, it can produce harmful algal blooms, impacting water quality and aquatic life.</p>
