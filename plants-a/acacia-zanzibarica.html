                        <h1>Acacia zanzibarica</h1>
<p>Acacia zanzibarica, commonly known as the Zanzibar umbrella tree, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by its dense, feathery foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, thread-like segments, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Acacia zanzibarica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to tropical climates.</p>
