                <h1>Actinophlebia horrida</h1>
<p>Actinophlebia horrida, commonly known as the rough actinophlebia, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to arid environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown in color.</p>
<p>Actinophlebia horrida is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in regions with low rainfall.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophlebia horrida has leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a leathery texture. The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is dark brown to black in color, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with four petals, typically in shades of yellow or green, blooming during the spring to early summer months, and they are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophlebia horrida is primarily native to eastern Australia, particularly in the states of New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions and sandy soils along the eastern coastline. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with dunes and coastal heathlands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species in some parts of its distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophlebia horrida was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often spreading through seed dispersal by water.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
