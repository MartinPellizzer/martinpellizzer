                <h1>Acer × guinieri</h1>
<p>Acer × guinieri, commonly known as the Red Maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Acer rubrum (Red Maple) and Acer negundo (Box Elder). The plant is characterized by its vibrant autumn foliage, which displays shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and typically have three to five lobes.</p>
<p>The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which aid in its dispersal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × guinieri has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and grayish-brown, with a straight growth pattern, and the bark remains relatively smooth even as the tree matures. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during early spring, with a simple structure and wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and well-developed, providing strong anchorage and efficient water absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × guinieri is a hybrid maple species that originated from the cross between *Acer saccharum* and *Acer rubrum*, both native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>Its native range is primarily in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. While it is not widely found in the wild, it is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks across temperate regions worldwide. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade, typically growing at altitudes between 300 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not considered endangered, its natural distribution has been reduced due to habitat loss and hybridization with other maple species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × guinieri is a hybrid maple tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seed propagation being the most common method. The growth cycle of Acer × guinieri involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and companion planting with plants like lavender or ornamental grasses can enhance its growth and aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer × guinieri is a hybrid maple species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring blossoms. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the aesthetic and ecological value of the landscape. Its dense foliage helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by offering habitat and food resources in forested and urban environments.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer × guinieri is a hybrid maple species primarily valued for its ornamental appeal, often cultivated in gardens and parks for its vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its wood has been occasionally utilized in small-scale woodworking projects. In traditional medicine, some parts of the plant may have been used for their potential anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation is limited. Culturally, it symbolizes the beauty of nature and seasonal change, making it a popular subject in art and literature.</p>
<p>Economically, it contributes to the horticultural industry by providing aesthetic value in landscaping and urban green spaces.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer × guinieri has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Autumn Flame' and 'Orange Queen,' which showcase vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>This species is a natural hybrid between Acer rubrum and Acer negundo, contributing to its genetic diversity and adaptability. Horticulturally, Acer × guinieri is important for its ability to thrive in a range of conditions, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Its unique foliage and growth habits enhance its appeal in both residential and public gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic qualities, it plays a significant role in the cultivation of ornamental trees.</p>
