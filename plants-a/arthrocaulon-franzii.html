                    <h1>Arthrocaulon franzii</h1>
<p>Arthrocaulon franzii, commonly known as the Franz's clubmoss, is a rare and primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, typical of its ancient lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed habitats.</p>
