                <h1>Adonis gracilis</h1>
<p>Adonis gracilis, commonly known as slender adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are usually hairy and lance-shaped.</p>
<p>Adonis gracilis is known for its early blooming period, often appearing in late spring, making it a notable species in high-altitude flora.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis gracilis has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, slightly hairy surface, and it grows upright with a branching pattern near the top. The flowers are small, clustered in dense umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions by anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis gracilis is primarily native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It grows in dry, rocky habitats such as chaparral and coastal bluffs. This plant is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often seen in the foothills and lower mountain ranges of its native range.</p>
<p>Adonis gracilis is also occasionally found in parts of Nevada and southern Idaho.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis gracilis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and gravelly slopes.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in the western United States, particularly in states like California, Oregon, and Nevada. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including agricultural expansion and land development.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
