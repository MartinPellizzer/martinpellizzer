                    <h1>Alnus × montana</h1>
<p>Alnus × montana, commonly known as the mountain alder, is a hybrid species within the genus Alnus, characterized by its deciduous nature and rapid growth.</p>
<p>It typically features small, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and it produces catkin-like flowers in early spring. The plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria.</p>
<p>Alnus × montana is often used in reforestation and erosion control due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in disturbed sites.</p>
