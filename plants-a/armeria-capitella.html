                    <h1>Armeria capitella</h1>
<p>Armeria capitella, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, fleshy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats, where it is resistant to salt spray and wind.</p>
<p>Armeria capitella plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing coastal soils.</p>
