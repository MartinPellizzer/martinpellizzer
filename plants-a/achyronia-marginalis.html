                <h1>Achyronia marginalis</h1>
<p>Achyronia marginalis, commonly known as the marginal achyronia, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pentagonal-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia marginalis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green color and a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia marginalis is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps, marshes, and other wetland habitats. This species is commonly found in the coastal plain regions where there is abundant sunlight and consistent moisture. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often associated with areas that have a subtropical climate.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia marginalis was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, broad leaves and ability to thrive in sunny, well-drained soils. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in coastal dunes and grasslands. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal through wind and water have led to its spread beyond initial planting sites.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now focused on controlling its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
