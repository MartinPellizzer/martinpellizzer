                <h1>Acomastylis rossii</h1>
<p>Acomastylis rossii, commonly known as the New Zealand starflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its star-shaped, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant features a rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Acomastylis rossii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acomastylis rossii has small, narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows in a compact, low shrub form. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense spikes, with a pale greenish-white color, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, winged seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomastylis rossii is primarily native to the arid regions of southern Africa, specifically Namibia and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Namib Desert and the Succulent Karoo biome. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to extreme drought conditions. It is often seen growing in rocky outcrops and along coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in these harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomastylis rossii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the ornamental plant trade. This plant has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its preference for specific soil and climate conditions.</p>
