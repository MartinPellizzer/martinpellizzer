                <h1>Achyranthes seychellensis</h1>
<p>Achyranthes seychellensis, commonly known as the Seychelles knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Seychelles islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes seychellensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and somewhat woody, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals and stamens, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, nutrient-rich soils of its native habitat.</p>
