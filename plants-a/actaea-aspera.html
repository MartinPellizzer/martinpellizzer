                <h1>Actaea aspera</h1>
<p>Actaea aspera, commonly known as the rough squirrelroot, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features large, palmately compound leaves with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring. Its fruit is a spherical aggregate of achenes, typically ripening in early autumn.</p>
<p>Actaea aspera is often found in moist, wooded areas and is known for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea aspera has compound, pinnate leaves that are typically 10â€“20 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is smooth and greenish-yellow in color, growing upright with a slightly woody base. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, arranged in an umbel, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains numerous small seeds, dispersed by birds and mammals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea aspera is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, wooded areas such as forests and thickets. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with rich, loamy soils. It is particularly prevalent in the northeastern and midwestern regions of North America.</p>
<p>Actaea aspera is known for its striking purple flowers and is often found in partial shade environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea aspera was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly in the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It was often planted in gardens and landscapes for its ornamental value. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas into natural habitats, especially in moist woodlands and streamside environments. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, its impact varies depending on local ecosystems and management practices.</p>
