                    <h1>Atriplex patula var. stricta</h1>
<p>Atriplex patula var. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of salt-tolerant hairs. The plant is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing degraded landscapes. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by small, oval-shaped fruits.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
