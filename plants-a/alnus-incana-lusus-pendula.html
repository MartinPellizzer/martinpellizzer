                    <h1>Alnus incana lusus pendula</h1>
<p>Alnus incana lusus pendula, commonly known as the weeping alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, giving it a distinctive and ornamental look. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the fall before shedding.</p>
<p>The weeping alder thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas.</p>
