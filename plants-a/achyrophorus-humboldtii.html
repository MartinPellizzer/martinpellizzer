                <h1>Achyrophorus humboldtii</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus humboldtii, commonly known as Humboldt's fireweed, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, coastal environments, often near tidal zones or in sandy soils. It has slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Humboldt's fireweed is known for its resilience to harsh coastal conditions and its role in stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus humboldtii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, dark green in color, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unbranched throughout its growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus humboldtii is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions and mountainous areas with a Mediterranean climate. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often associated with coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. It is also present in parts of Oregon and Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus humboldtii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity or natural disturbances.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it common in disturbed landscapes such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. The plant's ability to establish quickly gives it a competitive edge in these areas, sometimes leading to its dominance. It is particularly prevalent in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, Achyrophorus humboldtii has become a common invasive species in several parts of the world.</p>
