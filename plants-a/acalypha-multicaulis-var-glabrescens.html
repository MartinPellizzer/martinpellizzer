                <h1>Acalypha multicaulis var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Acalypha multicaulis var. glabrescens, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features palmately lobed leaves that are typically covered in a dense, soft pubescence, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers that are often hidden beneath the foliage. Its growth habit is upright, with multiple stems arising from the base, and it can reach heights of up to 2 meters.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or wetland habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha multicaulis var. glabrescens has ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy when young, and becomes smooth and reddish-brown with age, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with greenish-white bracts and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer; they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha multicaulis var. glabrescens is a variant of the species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now found in cultivation and occasionally in the wild in parts of Australia and New Zealand. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its limited natural habitat and habitat loss pose potential threats to its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha multicaulis var. glabrescens is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick and consistent results. This plant thrives in a warm, humid environment, following a rapid growth cycle during the growing season, typically from spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer every few weeks and light pruning to maintain shape and encourage new growth are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic appeal.</p>
