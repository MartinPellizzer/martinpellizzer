                    <h1>Agave schmithiana</h1>
<p>Agave schmithiana, commonly known as the Schmidth's agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall, branched flower stalk that bears yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
