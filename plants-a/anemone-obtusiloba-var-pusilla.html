                    <h1>Anemone obtusiloba var. pusilla</h1>
<p>Anemone obtusiloba var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf anemone, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has basal leaves that are rounded and hairy, with a short, stout stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the typical Anemone obtusiloba, with flowers that are proportionally larger relative to its size.</p>
