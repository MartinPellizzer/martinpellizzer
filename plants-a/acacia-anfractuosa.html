                        <h1>Acacia anfractuosa</h1>
<p>Acacia anfractuosa, commonly known as the zigzag acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging branches and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Acacia anfractuosa is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia anfractuosa belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and horsetails. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that typically have distinct floral parts and are often associated with a wide variety of habitats.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which includes plants that are often legumes and have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by their pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive acicular leaves and often for their ability to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia anfractuosa, a specific type of acacia known for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia anfractuosa is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the sandy soils of the southwestern region of the state. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Acacia anfractuosa plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia anfractuosa was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and western parts, as well as in parts of Southeast Asia. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Despite this, it remains an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
