<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has slender, grass-like blades with a bluish-gray hue due to the fine hairs covering its foliage. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny white to pale green flowers.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
