                <h1>Adenia peltata</h1>
<p>Adenia peltata, commonly known as the African star gooseberry, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by berries that are typically orange or red when mature. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Adenia peltata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and unique fruit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia peltata has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stems are woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grey or brown in color, and they grow as shrubs or small trees. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant, contributing to its stability in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia peltata is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern and southern regions of the island, where the climate is tropical and humid. This plant thrives in forested areas and is often associated with moist, shaded environments. It is a climbing plant that can reach significant heights, making it a notable species in the local flora.</p>
<p>Adenia peltata plays an important ecological role in the ecosystems of Madagascar.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia peltata was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high humidity and well-drained soil, often near streams or in dense forest understories. This plant is commonly found in parts of Southeast Asia, including countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. Its introduction has been primarily through natural dispersal by birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
