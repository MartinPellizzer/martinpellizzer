<p>Abronia turbinata, commonly known as the Turbinated Abronia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes or along the coastline where it is exposed to salt spray.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
