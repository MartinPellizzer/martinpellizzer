<p>Alchemilla microcarpa subsp.</p>
<p>leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves that are typically green to gray-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps to retain moisture and protect against harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>
