                <h1>Acorellus pannonicus</h1>
<p>Acorellus pannonicus, commonly known as the Pannonian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowering period occurs in late summer.</p>
<p>Acorellus pannonicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorellus pannonicus has leaves that are simple, alternate, and ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright and branching sparingly. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorellus pannonicus is primarily native to the Pannonian Basin, which spans parts of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. This plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in forested or semi-natural habitats. It is commonly associated with riparian zones and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological conditions that support its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorellus pannonicus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and gardening.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in urban areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain environments.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied by botanists and ecologists.</p>
