                <h1>Acorellus pannonicus</h1>
<p>Acorellus pannonicus, commonly known as the Pannonian acorus, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves that float just above the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often emerging from the water. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in its habitat.</p>
<p>Acorellus pannonicus plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorellus pannonicus has leaves that are simple, alternate, and ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged spirally along the stem and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The stem is slender, herbaceous, and has a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with four petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorellus pannonicus is a rare plant species native to the Pannonian Basin, primarily found in Hungary and parts of Croatia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has become increasingly limited, with populations now restricted to a few isolated locations in the Carpathian Mountains. It thrives in moist, calcareous grasslands and forest edges, often in areas with well-drained soils. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 300 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acorellus pannonicus is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acorellus pannonicus is a lesser-known plant that thrives in specific ecological conditions, making it a unique choice for gardeners interested in native flora.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with the latter method offering faster results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and it prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soil with consistent moisture. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning after flowering help maintain its health and shape.</p>
<p>It is relatively resistant to pests and diseases but may benefit from companion planting with marigolds or garlic to deter potential threats.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acorellus pannonicus is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for its reproduction and the health of the ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other species in its vicinity. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil fertility through organic matter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acorellus pannonicus is a lesser-known plant that has limited direct culinary use but is occasionally foraged for its edible leaves in certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its potential diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. While not widely utilized in industrial applications, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports pollinators in its native habitats. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in some regions, representing resilience and natural heritage.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems highlights its importance for environmental conservation and sustainable land management.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acorellus pannonicus has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Albus' and 'Candidus', which are known for their striking white flowers and compact growth habit. Hybrids of Acorellus pannonicus are often developed to enhance flower size, color, and disease resistance. These plants hold horticultural importance as they are used in gardens and landscapes for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>Their cultivation contributes to biodiversity and the beauty of cultivated plant collections.</p>
