<p>Auganthus oreodoxus, commonly known as the mountain fuchsia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Onagraceae family, characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
