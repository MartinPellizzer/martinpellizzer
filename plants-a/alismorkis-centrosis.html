<p>Alismorkis centrosis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterplantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 cm wide, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers in clustered inflorescences. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Alismorkis centrosis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
