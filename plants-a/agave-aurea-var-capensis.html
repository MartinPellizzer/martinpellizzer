                    <h1>Agave aurea var. capensis</h1>
<p>Agave aurea var. capensis, commonly known as the Cape agave, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-green flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
