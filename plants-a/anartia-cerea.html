                    <h1>Anartia cerea</h1>
<p>Anartia cerea, commonly known as the white-spotted charaxes, is a species of butterfly found in various parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nymphalidae and is characterized by its distinctive white spots on the wings. The plant is not a botanical entity but a butterfly species, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. Therefore, I cannot provide information on its botanical features.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
