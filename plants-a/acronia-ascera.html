                <h1>Acronia ascera</h1>
<p>Acronia ascera, commonly known as the creeping sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a rough texture that helps it withstand arid conditions.</p>
<p>Acronia ascera is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia ascera has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green in color, featuring four petals and stamen, and bloom during the spring season, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia ascera is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in coastal areas and dry forests. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with limestone substrates. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Acronia ascera is also known for its ornamental value, making it a popular plant in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia ascera was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in states like Florida and Texas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along utility corridors. The plant has adapted well to these environments, often thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have contributed to its establishment in these areas.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species and has not been widely reported as invasive in the regions where it is found.</p>
