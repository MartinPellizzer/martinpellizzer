                    <h1>Aira articulata</h1>
<p>Aira articulata, commonly known as the slender false wheat, is a grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and marshy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread across wetland habitats.</p>
<p>While not commonly cultivated, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
