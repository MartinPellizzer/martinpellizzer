                <h1>Achillea millefolium var. iserana</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. iserana, commonly known as Alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pinkish in color. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh, mountainous environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. iserana has leaves that are finely divided, feathery, and pinnately arranged, with a bright green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, slightly hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing in a basal rosette pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. iserana is a subspecies of yarrow native to the Alps, primarily found in Switzerland, Italy, and Austria.</p>
<p>Its current distribution extends to parts of southern Europe, including France and Germany. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its limited range and specific habitat requirements make it vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. iserana is a hardy perennial herb known for its attractive, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, though it often behaves as a short-lived perennial in colder climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding wet feet. Fertilization should be light, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too damp.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and repel pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. iserana is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering shelter and sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological balance by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. iserana is a variant of yarrow known for its ornamental value in gardens and its role in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>It has been used historically for its anti-inflammatory and astringent properties, making it useful in treating wounds and digestive issues.
