                <h1>Actinoschoenus thouarsii</h1>
<p>Actinoschoenus thouarsii, commonly known as the Madagascar star grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Actinoschoenus thouarsii is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinoschoenus thouarsii has leaves that are typically lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered in a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoschoenus thouarsii is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern part of the island, specifically in the coastal areas and lowland forests. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Madagascar, making it a unique and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoschoenus thouarsii was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It was brought there by early European explorers and settlers. This plant has since become naturalized in several coastal areas. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native plant species.</p>
