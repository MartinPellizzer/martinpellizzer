                <h1>Adelobotrys scandens</h1>
<p>Adelobotrys scandens, commonly known as the climbing thornapple, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a woody vine that typically grows along forest edges or in disturbed areas. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are often pink or white in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>The plant contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys scandens has alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are typically 2-5 cm in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. It produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread horizontally, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys scandens is primarily native to Brazil North, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Peru, and Suriname.</p>
<p>This climbing plant is commonly found in tropical rainforest regions within these countries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments along forest understories. The species is known for its woody stems and small, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution spans much of South America's tropical regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys scandens was mainly introduced to coastal and disturbed areas, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dunes, roadsides, and along the edges of forests. This plant spreads through its runners, which allow it to colonize new areas rapidly. Due to its aggressive growth, it can outcompete native vegetation in invaded habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
