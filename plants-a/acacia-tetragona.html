<p>Acacia tetragona, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia tetragona is also valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a source of nectar for native pollinators.</p>
