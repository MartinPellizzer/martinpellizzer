                <h1>Achnatherum mongholicum</h1>
<p>Achnatherum mongholicum, commonly known as Mongolian needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, steppes, and mountain slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum mongholicum has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, cylindrical, and have a smooth texture, often growing in dense tufts or colonies. The flowers are spike-like inflorescences composed of small, greenish-yellow spikelets that bloom in late summer, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum mongholicum is primarily native to northern China, Mongolia, and parts of Russia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in grasslands and steppes. This plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often part of the vegetation in dry, open habitats. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range, with drought-resistant features.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological conditions of the Mongolian Plateau and adjacent areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum mongholicum was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in semi-arid and arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant has been introduced in various parts of China, particularly in the northern and western provinces. It plays a vital role in improving land degradation and supporting biodiversity in these areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has contributed to the recovery of degraded grasslands and the enhancement of local ecosystems.</p>
