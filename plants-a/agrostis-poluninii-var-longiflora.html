<p>Agrostis poluninii var. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant features slender,丛生 stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. It produces numerous small, wind-pollinated flowers that mature into bristly, awned seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats.</p>
