                    <h1>Agave horrida</h1>
<p>Agave horrida, commonly known as the rough agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, spiky leaves that are covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears yellow flowers, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Agave horrida is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
