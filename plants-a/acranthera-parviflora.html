                <h1>Acranthera parviflora</h1>
<p>Acranthera parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered acranthera, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique floral structure, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera parviflora has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered with fine hairs, exhibiting a light green to grayish color. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, with five petals and a tubular throat, blooming in spring and attracting pollinators like bees through nectar. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera parviflora is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, where it thrives in the humid and warm climate. The plant typically grows in shaded understorey environments, often near the forest floor. It is part of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its small, delicate flowers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera parviflora was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in fynbos vegetation, thriving in areas with sandy soils and a Mediterranean climate. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value due to its delicate, fragrant flowers. It prefers full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native flora.</p>
