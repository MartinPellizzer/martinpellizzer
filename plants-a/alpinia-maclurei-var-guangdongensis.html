                    <h1>Alpinia maclurei var. guangdongensis</h1>
<p>Alpinia maclurei var. guangdongensis, commonly known as the Guangdong ginger, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Alpinia genus.</p>
<p>It is native to southern China, particularly Guangdong province, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. This plant is characterized by its tall, erect rhizomes and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in spikes, and are followed by small, triangular fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical studies.</p>
