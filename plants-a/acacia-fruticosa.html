<p>Acacia fruticosa, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces flat, bean-like pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils.</p>
<p>Acacia fruticosa is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas.</p>
