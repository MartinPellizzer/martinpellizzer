<p>Acer japonicum var. aureum, commonly known as the golden Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant has a compact growth habit with a broad, rounded canopy. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a smooth, glossy surface.</p>
<p>It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer japonicum var. aureum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a bright yellow to gold coloration during the growing season.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright, spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellow-green catkins that appear in early spring, with a wind pollination method. The fruit is a samara with a winged seed, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer japonicum var. aureum is a variant of the Japanese maple known for its golden foliage.</p>
<p>Native to Japan, it originally thrived in the mountainous regions of Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. Today, it is cultivated in gardens and parks across temperate regions worldwide, including parts of North America and Europe. It prefers moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially sunny environments, typically found at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters.</p>
